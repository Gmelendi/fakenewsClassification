" a sweeping corruption case against a former mayor of pennsylvania’s capital city harrisburg ended on monday when he pleaded guilty to 20 counts of receiving stolen artifacts bought with public funds for a proposed museum that was never built in the city. former mayor stephen r. reed, 67, made the plea on the morning when jury selection in his trial was scheduled to begin in dauphin county court of common pleas. as part of the plea deal, prosecutors dropped 94 other counts. reed, who was originally charged in 2015 with nearly 500 criminal counts, could receive up to nine months in prison under state sentencing guidelines when judge kevin hess sentences him on friday, although he may only get probation. many of the more serious charges, including bribery and siphoning money from bond issues, were dismissed last year on statute of limitations grounds.  “today’s guilty plea marks the final chapter in a case that has gone on for several years,” said deputy attorney general rebecca frantz. “this will help the city of harrisburg to move on.” reed, known as an avid private collector of civil war and american west memorabilia during his 28 years in office, pleaded guilty to illegal possession of 20 historical documents and photographs with a total value of more than $18,000.  the artifacts were among thousands acquired by reed with public funds for a proposed museum of the american west that he had hoped to build in financially strapped harrisburg. after his plea, reed told reporters he experienced “gut wrenching humiliation and embarrassment” over his arrest, after serving as harrisburg’s mayor for decades. he said many of the artifacts seized from his home and warehouse during a raid in 2015 were legally owned by him, but similar to ones acquired with public funds for the museum. he believes the 20 items in the plea were accidentally placed in boxes of his own papers after he hastily left office following his defeat in 2010, but acknowledged the packing was done under his supervision. “the precepts of my faith require that i take responsibility for this error, and that was my ultimate deciding factor in doing this plea,” reed said. a hearing is scheduled in march on reed’s petition for the return of artifacts he believes belong to him. frantz said prosecutors would oppose that request. harrisburg has been under state financial supervision since 2011, primarily because of cost overruns on an incinerator retrofit project.

" chancellor angela merkel won a fourth term in office in the german national election on sept. 24, but a fractured vote that brings the far right into parliament means she must try to work out a three way coalition untested at federal level. the new alliance would comprise merkel s conservative bloc   her christian democratic union (cdu) and the bavarian christian social union (csu)   along with the pro business free democrats (fdp) and environmentalist greens. such a tie up is called a  jamaica  coalition, because the three parties  colors of black, yellow and green match those of the jamaican flag. to secure a coalition deal, the unlikely bedfellows must overcome differences on a range of issues from immigration policy, europe and tax to the environment. it is unclear whether a cdu/csu compromise on immigration policy will be palatable to the greens and fdp. the cdu came second to the social democrats in a regional vote in lower saxony at the weekend. following are remarks on the possible coalition from senior officials:  we will not manage without compromises.   we d be well advised not to be perfectionists in the upcoming coalition negotiations but rather to be open and to build trust that a government will be formed that acts sensibly, even during unforeseeable crises.  on  jamaica :  whether it succeeds, whether a government is formed, is yet to be seen.   it will be difficult for all partners ... because our programs diverge vastly in many areas and because we must now pull ourselves together and see if coalition negotiations are possible or not.       we don t have to govern. there is also the possibility of another grand coalition (between merkel s conservatives and the social democrats).   it can succeed. the most important thing is that trust needs to be built between participants, and that takes time. that s why it would be illusory to believe we could conclude negotiations by christmas.   no one would understand it if the new government does not pass an immigration law.  we need a mix of humanity and order. we greens also want to secure the eu s external borders and build a sensible database of fingerprints.  there must be a compromise that nonetheless represents everyone.   this (the conservative s immigration pact) is an agreement between the cdu and csu, and far from the result of exploratory talks for a coalition with the fdp and greens.   immigration is not the only issue where the parties have different ideas.   i am certain that, in the end, the solution that the cdu/csu have found with each other will not be the basis for common work (with us) for the next four years.   no party can expect the others to accept its original wording without changes ... but i believe that a signal about limiting immigration on humanitarian grounds will ultimately make its way into the coalition agreement.   europe s fiscal policy needs a shift away from austerity toward a common pact for tax collection and investments, which would trigger social and ecological innovations.   a red line for us in coalition talks is the mutualization of debt in europe, the creation of new pots of money.  in a monetary union where the deficit rules of maastricht are respected, there is no need for permanent rescue funds.   what we christian democrats call  preservation of creation  overlaps a lot with what the greens call a sustainable approach to nature.   there can only be a jamaica tax concept if it includes the end of the solidarity surcharge without taking that money out of people s pockets somewhere else.   the chancellery and the finance ministry should be politically separate. a greens, a csu or an fdp finance minister   anything would be better than leaving the finance ministry in cdu hands.

" singapore is grappling with a controversy that refuses to go away, a month after rainwater flooded a tunnel of its mass rapid transit (mrt) service, leading to the partial suspension of train runs at weekends. a rare public apology by top transit executives and an assurance from the government that the cause was clear and the fix not complicated have done little to appease the public that has come to expect glitch free efficiency.     the front page of the state owned straits times newspaper this week featured a photo of grim faced top transit executives in the gallery of parliament as the transport minister said they had to do better and could face pay cuts.  the facts of the 7 october incident are not complicated, and the cause of the incident is clear,  minister khaw boon wan said, adding that poor maintenance and neglect of duties by transit managers were to blame.  it is the responsibility of management to set the right culture of professionalism and excellence. it begins from the top. and if there is poor culture, the ceo is responsible.  the scrutiny of the disruption, which in most cities would be considered minor and barely newsworthy, reflected the pressure on the government to explain how it had failed to deliver a near perfect public service.  singapore residents are highly dependent on public transport. it is one of the world s most expensive places to own a vehicle and it recently announced that it will not allow any growth in its car population from february. voter discontent with public services can be particularly alarming to the ruling party which saw its worst election showing in 2011 when 40 percent of voters went against it, partly in dismay over the growing strains on public transport. the people s action party has ruled singapore, one of the richest and most stable countries in the world, without interruption since independence in 1965.  transit operator smrt chief desmond kuek was quoted in an email to staff as saying this week should have been a celebration marking the 30 year anniversary of the subway operations.  instead, we were awash in collective shame because a few of our staff had let us down,  kuek said in the email, according to the straits times.

" u.s. president donald trump on monday said he plans to nominate liberty university school of law professor caren harp to oversee the justice department’s office of juvenile justice and delinquency prevention. if ultimately confirmed by the u.s. senate, harp would oversee the justice department office that trains and works with state and local communities to develop effective juvenile justice programs and prevent delinquency. harp previously was director of the national juvenile justice prosecution center at the american prosecutors research institute.  according to harp’s linkedin page, she is in her sixth year as a professor at liberty, which is located in lynchburg, virginia. the law school’s website says its program is “taught from a christian worldview” and says it offers a “uniquely tailored legal program taught with sound biblical principles.” harp, who holds a law degree from the university of arkansas fayetteville, has also worked as both a prosecutor and a public defender, including as chief of the sex crimes prosecution unit in new york city, family court division, and as a trial attorney for the arkansas public defender commission.  in an article published in may, harp raises questions about the role of adolescent neuroscience in the courtroom and writes that the best way to tackle juvenile justice is by teaching youth to accept responsibility and involve them in community based diversion programs to prevent them from re offending.      “misplaced reliance on nascent neuroscience and neuroimaging evidence to remove from youth and young adults the consequences of their criminal behavior invites pushback from those who favor a retributive system, and it may create some unintended and unwanted consequences for youth and young adults,” she writes. it is unclear when the senate may consider harp’s nomination. there are a handful of key nominees who have been waiting months now for their confirmation votes. nominees to head the criminal, civil and national security divisions, for instance, are still pending.

" u.s. house democrats introduced legislation on wednesday to direct banking regulators to review operations at the country’s largest banks and consider shutting them down if they exhibit repeated wrongdoing to consumers.  the bill, likely to meet stiff opposition from the republican majority in congress, represents the most direct threat yet from policymakers eager to see the nation’s biggest banks, including wells fargo and jpmorgan chase, broken up. “it is clear steeper penalties need to be used when a megabank demonstrates a pattern of consumer abuse,” said representative maxine waters, a lead sponsor of the bill and the top democrat on the house financial services committee. deficiencies in processing customer complaints, servicing residential mortgages, as well as engaging in deceptive business practices or opening unauthorized accounts could all be deemed harmful to consumers under the bill, opening banks up to significant regulatory action. eight democrats, led by waters, introduced the legislation on wednesday. if signed into law, the bill would require federal banking regulators to review every u.s. bank identified as a “global systemically important bank” within 90 days. specifically, regulators would need to determine if the banks have exhibited “repeated law violations that harmed consumers,” as defined by the consumer financial protection bureau, another federal regulator. the bill puts pressure directly on banking regulators, who democrats argue are not utilizing all their tools to curb what they see as bad behavior in the banking sector. democrats in congress are frequently critical of the banking sector, but this new legislation represents the most direct attempt by lawmakers to significantly curb big banks.     if any banks are found to be repeat offenders, regulators would have 120 days to begin winding the institution down and barring its executives from the financial industry, using their existing powers. and large bank executives would be required to attest annually they have reviewed all lines of bank business and are compliant with consumer protection laws. executives would also face heightened civil and criminal liability under the bill. lawmakers backing the bill identified several banks they believe should face such a comprehensive review and possible dissolution, including wells fargo, jpmorgan, bank of america, and citigroup. one week earlier, waters released a report claiming wells fargo has shown a “pattern of abusive business practices,” making clear, and reiterated her belief the bank should be broken up. spokespeople for those banks either declined to comment on waters’s bill or did not immediately respond to a request for comment. the new bill is also the latest step democrats have taken to increase pressure on banking regulators, who they believe are not taking a sufficiently harsh stance with the industry. senator elizabeth warren of massachusetts has repeatedly pressed the federal reserve to remove members of wells’s board of directors who were in that role when bank employees created potentially millions of fake customer accounts. warren has not signed on to the new legislation.

" democrat hillary clinton’s unexpected defeat in michigan has laid bare growing voter anger over international trade, raising warning flags for her ahead of a possible presidential election showdown against republican front runner donald trump. trump has built his campaign on pledges to scrap international trade deals and do more to protect american workers from foreign competition, tapping the same groundswell of discontent that propelled clinton’s rival bernie sanders to victory in the midwestern state on tuesday. clinton remains heavily favored to win the democratic nomination. but the setback in michigan could signal further troubles in upcoming primaries in other rust belt states such as ohio, forcing her further to the left on economic issues and possibly influencing her choice for an eventual running mate, strategists said. the backlash against 20 years of trade liberalization has stalled the trans pacific partnership (tpp), a sweeping pacific trade deal backed by president barack obama and threatens to stymie the trade agenda for years to come. “it’s politically radioactive to support free trade right now,” said greg valliere, a washington analyst for horizon investments, a financial firm. clinton’s troubles with her party’s left wing — and with white, working class voters more generally — may steer her toward a trade skeptic such as senator sherrod brown of ohio as a vice presidential running mate, said democratic strategist steve jarding. political pundits had expected clinton to pick someone to increase her appeal to hispanic or other minority voters, such as u.s. housing and urban development julian castro. sanders, 74, is unlikely to end up as clinton’s running mate, partly due to his age, democrats said. both sanders, a democratic socialist, and billionaire trump have harnessed anti trade sentiment in their insurgent white house bids, criticizing deals like nafta as job killers that have depressed the living standards of working americans. exit polls from michigan, a hub of the u.s. auto industry, show widespread voter skepticism on trade that may have helped sanders and trump win their respective party primaries.  “she made a fundamental mistake early on in this campaign to try to stay in the center,” democratic strategist steve jarding said of clinton. “this cycle, there is no center.” sanders campaigned heavily against foreign trade in a state that has been hammered by overseas competition since the 1980s. some 58 percent of his supporters in michigan exit polls said that trade takes away u.s. jobs, while a slight majority   53 percent   of clinton backers said trade creates u.s. jobs. the economic policy institute, a left leaning think tank, estimates that michigan would lose 5 percent of its jobs if tpp were to take effect, the highest proportion of any state. gary hunley, a substitute teacher in dearborn, michigan, said he believed clinton was partially to blame for stagnant wages because nafta was enacted under her husband bill clinton’s presidency in the 1990s. “she was not a passive first lady,” hunley said. clinton’s stance on trade is more nuanced than trump’s and sanders’. after nafta was enacted, she voted against a free trade deal with central america while serving as a u.s. senator in the following decade. as obama’s secretary of state, clinton helped negotiate the tpp with japan, vietnam and other pacific rim countries.  as a presidential candidate, clinton has said after reading the final language of the deal she would vote against it because it does not adequately protect u.s. workers.  clinton campaign manager robby mook told reporters wednesday there were no plans to adjust her stance and that he would “put secretary clinton up against any candidate in this race on trade,” including trump.  despite backing by the obama administration, republican lawmakers and many business groups, republican leaders in congress have shown no sign that they will bring tpp up for a  vote this year. the obama administration says the deal has high labor and environmental standards that were not part of nafta. “i’m not sure that has fully been absorbed in the public mindset,” u.s. national security adviser susan rice told reuters. [l1n16h1vj] the deal may fare no better under the next president. sanders and trump oppose tpp, and senator ted cruz, who is in second place in the republican contest, has said he would not vote for it this year. “they’ve listened to the public and politicians have caught up with the public on this,” brown, the ohio democratic senator, told reuters. the evidence that the tpp would help the u.s. economy much is less than conclusive. the peter g. peterson institute, a pro trade think tank, estimates that it would boost economic growth by just 0.5 percent after 15 years. the deal would not boost employment overall, but would result in a “churn” of 53,700 jobs lost and created each year, and it would boost incomes by 0.5 percent, the institute found.  another estimate by the global development and environment institute at tufts university found the trade deal would slow growth by 0.54 percent after 10 years and cost 448,000 jobs in the united states.

" singapore named a former speaker of parliament as the multicultural city state s first woman president on wednesday while critics expressed dismay that other candidates were disqualified and the election went uncontested. aiming to strengthen a sense of inclusivity, singapore had decreed the presidency, a largely ceremonial six year post, would be reserved for candidates from the minority malay community this time. the returning officer declared halimah yacob, 63, elected on wednesday after nominations closed. of the four other applicants, two were not malays and two were not qualified to contest, the elections department said on monday. halimah had automatically qualified because she held a senior public post for over three years. if the election had been held, all citizens would have been eligible to vote. several critics went online to protest against the stringent eligibility rules, which include a stipulation that a candidate from the private sector should have headed a company with paid up capital of at least s$500 million ($370 million). the prime minister s office said it had no comment on   criticism of the election process.  it would have restored some of the lost moral authority by her winning against credible opponents through popular votes,  said opposition politician yee jenn jong in a blog post.  she is, after all, a veteran in elections and has won handsomely in the four general elections she stood in.  the rights group association of women for action and research (aware) said it hoped  more will be done to improve access to politics for all of singapore s women .  unfortunately, the process that led to this outcome has not reflected our hopes,  it said in a statement posted online. displays of dissent are rare in singapore, one of the richest and most politically stable countries in the world. it has been ruled by the people s action party (pap) since independence in 1965 and the current prime minister, lee hsien loong, is the son of the country s founding father lee kuan yew. in the 2015 general election   held months after the death of lee kuan yew   the pap won almost 70 per cent of the popular vote and swept all but six of parliament s 89 seats. the incoming president, who is to be sworn in on thursday, appeared unfazed by the controversy.  although this is a reserved election, i m not a reserved president,  halimah said in a speech at the election nominations office.  i m a president for everyone.  whether or not there is an election or no election, my promise is to serve everyone and i will serve with great vigor, with a lot of hard work, with the same passion and commitment.

" the cuban diplomats expelled from the united states this week included all those dealing with u.s. businesses, cuba s embassy in washington told reuters on thursday, dealing another blow to bilateral commercial ties. in an escalating crisis between the cold war foes, the trump administration on tuesday expelled 15 diplomats to protest communist run cuba s failure to protect u.s. embassy staff in havana from a mysterious spate of alleged health attacks.   due to this decision, the activities developed by the economic and trade office of the embassy of cuba to the united states ... will be seriously affected,  one cuban diplomat said in a farewell message to a u.s. group that takes investors to the caribbean s largest island. the cuban embassy is often the first step in the process for u.s. companies to explore opportunities and make a pitch. officials help them submit a trip proposal, seek out counterparts at state owned enterprises in the centralized economy, and receive a business visa to travel to havana. whether the embassy will still be issuing such visas remains unclear, given one diplomat will remain in the consular section. on the american side, the downgrade of the u.s. embassy   washington last friday ordered the departure of all non emergency staff   will likely make it harder for u.s. companies to find their way in cuba.  it s the chilling effect of a diplomatic crisis,  said pedro freyre, a cuban born attorney who heads the international practice at law firm akerman. some u.s. companies may choose to stay on the sidelines until relations improve, he said, adding that his clients already pursuing opportunities in cuba were staying the course as they saw it as a long term play. u.s. companies flocked to cuba in the wake of the detente former democratic president barack obama agreed in 2014. some deals allowed by new exemptions to the decades old u.s. embargo have come to fruition. american airlines (aal.o) and united airlines (ual.n) now run commercial flights to cuba. royal caribbean (rcl.n) and carnival corp (ccl.n) operate cruises there. the original frenzy in u.s. commercial interest in cuba was tempered by the realization that doing business in cash strapped cuba was difficult and even harder with a trade embargo in place. businesses now face a hostile stance from republican u.s. president donald trump, who in june ordered tighter restrictions on travel and trade that have yet to be unveiled. last friday, his administration issued a warning on travel to the island.

" the u.s. house of representatives on tuesday approved a measure that would for the first time require the homeland security department to use testimonials from former extremists to counter recruiting messages from militant groups. “terrorists are radicalizing our citizens online and across borders, which is why we need this legislation,” said house homeland security committee chairman michael mccaul. the measure was approved 322 to 79. international allies of the united states such as britain have long used testimony by disillusioned former extremists to discourage young people from joining militant groups. despite support for the technique from u.s. officials including president barack obama, the united states has not used it. lawmakers clashed because the proposal suggests using testimonials to counter “foreign terrorist organizations” but does not mention domestic extremists.  concern about domestic extremism has grown more intense since the december shootings by an islamic state inspired couple in san bernardino, california, and the occupation of a wildlife refuge in oregon by domestic anti government militants earlier this year.  republican supporters of the measure emphasized that the bill would not prevent using testimonials from former extremists to combat domestic recruitment.  congressional aides said on monday they expect partner legislation to be introduced this week in the senate. the department of homeland security declined to comment, but said in a march memo that such a program could place a “significant burden on already limited resources.”  the department also said in the memo that it already has the authority to use testimonials from former extremists, but that it wants to avoid giving the impression that its current community outreach efforts might be used to gather them.

" a lawyer nominated by president donald trump to serve as a federal judge withdrew from consideration on monday after video of his senate confirmation hearing showing him unable to provide answers to rudimentary legal questions went viral last week. trump accepted matthew petersen’s offer to withdraw his nomination as a district court judge in washington, a white house official said. petersen, a republican member of the federal election commission, became the latest of trump’s judicial nominations to fail as the president seeks to win confirmation of judges who will make the federal judiciary more conservative. “just because you’ve seen ‘my cousin vinny’ doesn’t qualify you to be a federal judge,” republican senator john kennedy, who grilled petersen during his dec. 13 confirmation hearing, told wwl tv, referring to the 1992 comedy film about a novice lawyer. kennedy, who has been critical of some of trump’s judicial nominees, asked several basic legal questions that petersen could not answer. the video was shown on cable news shows and widely viewed on the internet. “while i am honored to have been nominated for this position, it has become clear to me over the past few days that my nomination has become a distraction   and that is not fair to you or your administration,” petersen wrote in his withdrawal letter to trump. “i had hoped that my nearly two decades of public service might carry more weight than my two worst minutes on television,” petersen added. petersen became the third trump judicial pick whose nomination foundered in the past week. republican senator chuck grassley, chairman of the senate judiciary committee, said last week trump’s nominations of jeff mateer and brett talley would not move forward. both had faced criticism for controversial statements. talley was reported by online magazine slate as having posted online sympathetic comments about the early history of the ku klux klan (kkk) white supremacist group. he also failed to disclose that his wife works in the white house counsel’s office, which overseas judicial nominations. mateer ran into trouble over 2015 speeches including one in which he referred to transgender children as being part of “satan’s plans,” cnn reported. despite those setbacks, trump has made significant progress in filling vacancies on the federal courts with conservative judges, including 12 on the important courts of appeal. he also appointed justice neil gorsuch to fill a vacancy on the supreme courts, restoring the high court’s conservative majority.

" president donald trump signed a revised executive order on monday banning citizens from six muslim majority nations from traveling to the united states but removing iraq from the list, after his controversial first attempt was blocked in the courts. the new order, which takes effect on march 16, keeps a 90 day ban on travel to the united states by citizens of iran, libya, syria, somalia, sudan and yemen. it applies only to new visa applicants, meaning some 60,000 people whose visas were revoked under the previous order will now be permitted to enter. immigration advocates said the new ban still discriminated against muslims and failed to address some of their concerns with the previous order. legal experts said it would, however, be harder to challenge because it affects fewer people living in the united states and allows more exemptions to protect them. trump, who first proposed a temporary travel ban on muslims during his presidential campaign last year, had said his original jan. 27 executive order was a national security measure meant to head off attacks by islamist militants.  it sparked chaos and protests at airports, where visa holders were detained and later deported back to their home countries. it also drew criticism from targeted countries, western allies and some of america’s leading corporations before a u.s. judge suspended it on feb. 3.  “as threats to our security continue to evolve and change, common sense dictates that we continually re evaluate and reassess the systems we rely upon to protect our country,” secretary of state rex tillerson told reporters after trump signed the new order.  democrats, a minority in congress, quickly signaled fierce opposition to what they called a discriminatory ban. “the trump administration’s repackaging has done nothing to change the immoral, unconstitutional and dangerous goals of their muslim and refugee ban,” house of representatives democratic leader nancy pelosi said in a statement. farhana khera, executive director of muslim advocates, a civil rights group in washington, said the trump administration had “doubled down on anti muslim bigotry.” she told reporters on a conference call: “it’s crystal clear this is a muslim ban.”  but some republicans who had been critical of trump’s original order were more positive on the new one. bob corker, chairman of the senate foreign relations committee, said he was “very encouraged” by the approach and pleased that iraq was removed from the list. iraq was taken off the banned list because the iraqi government has imposed new vetting procedures, such as heightened visa screening and data sharing, and because of its work with the united states in countering islamic state militants, a senior white house official said. trump’s original ban resulted in more than two dozen lawsuits in u.s. courts. the justice department estimated 60,000 people had their visas revoked by the first order but senior administration officials said on monday those visas were now valid again for entry into the united states. “by rescinding his earlier executive order, president trump makes one thing perfectly clear: his original travel ban was indefensible   legally, constitutionally and morally,” said    attorney general bob ferguson of washington state, which succeeded in having the previous ban suspended. his office will likely decide this week on whether to proceed with litigation over the new order, he said. senate democratic leader chuck schumer said he expected the revised order to have the same uphill battle in the courts as the original version. “a watered down ban is still a ban,” he said in a statement. “despite the administration’s changes, this dangerous executive order makes us less safe, not more, it is mean spirited, and un american. it must be repealed.” the fact the ban affects fewer people already in the united states means it will be more difficult for opponents to find plaintiffs who have been harmed by the order and thus have legal standing to challenge it, legal experts said.  the revised order expressly makes waivers possible for a foreign national seeking to enter the united states to visit a spouse, child or parent who is a u.s. citizen, or for “significant business or professional obligations.”   “they dotted their i’s and crossed their t’s in trying to anticipate what litigation might result,” said stephen yale loehr, a cornell law school professor. the revised order means that tens of thousands of legal permanent u.s. residents   or green card holders   from the listed countries will no longer be affected. the original order barred travelers from the seven nations from entering for 90 days and all refugees for 120 days. refugees from syria were to be banned indefinitely but under the new order they are not given separate treatment. refugees “in transit” and already approved would be able to travel to the united states under the new order. defense secretary jim mattis, who along with several other senior cabinet members had lobbied for iraq’s removal from the list of banned countries, was consulted on the new order and the updated version “does reflect his inputs,” pentagon spokesman captain jeff davis said.  thousands of iraqis have fought alongside u.s. troops for years or worked as translators since the u.s. led invasion in 2003. many have resettled in the united states after being threatened for working with u.s. troops.

" former authoritarian leader alberto fujimori sought forgiveness from peruvians  from the bottom of my heart  on tuesday for shortcomings during his rule, and thanked president pedro pablo kuczynski for granting him a christmas pardon. in a video on facebook, fujimori, 79, vowed that as a free man, he would support kuczynski s call for reconciliation, hinting that he would not return to politics.  i m aware the results of my government were well received by some, but i acknowledge i also disappointed other compatriots,  the ailing fujimori said, reading from notes while connected to tubes in a hospital bed.  and to them, i ask for forgiveness from the bottom of my heart.   the remarks were fujimori s first explicit apology to the andean nation that he governed with an iron fist from 1990 2000. they came after two days of unrest as protesters slammed the pardon as an insult to victims and part of a political deal to help kuczynski survive a scandal. the pardon cleared fujimori s convictions for graft and human rights crimes during his leadership of the rightwing government. late on monday, kuczynski, a 79 year old former wall street banker, appealed to peruvians opposed to the pardon to  turn the page  and defended his decision as justified clemency for a sick man whose government helped the country progress.  i cannot keep from expressing my profound gratitude for the complex step that the president took, which commits me in this new stage of my life to decidedly support his call for reconciliation,  fujimori said.

" china will bring its paramilitary police force, the people s armed police, under the control of the central military commission which controls the country s armed forces from jan. 1, state media said on wednesday. since taking power five years ago, president xi jinping has overseen a sweeping modernization of the people s liberation army, the world s largest military, laying off troops, streamlining its organization and investing in advanced weapons. in a brief report, the official xinhua news agency said that from midnight on jan. 1 the people s armed police would no longer fall under the purview of the state council, or cabinet, and instead report to the central military commission. xi heads the central military commission in his role as armed forces chief and commander in chief. xi has steadily consolidated his power over the military, and has appointed allies to key positions of power in the armed forces. xinhua did not provide any details on how the new reporting structure would work or why the government had made the decision. however, the party s official people s daily, in a commentary for publication on thursday but reported by xinhua on wednesday, said the move was needed to ensure security and promote the aim of having a  strong military . the people s armed police will remain separate, carry out its existing functions and not be absorbed into the people s liberation army, the people s daily said. the paramilitary police force serves as a backup for the military in times of war, and domestically has a role in putting down protests and counter terrorism as well as border defense and fire fighting. xi has radically overhauled the old soviet era command structure of the military to make the armed forces nimbler and better able to respond to crises at home and abroad. that has included condensing the command structure and giving greater emphasis on new capabilities including cyberspace, electronic and information warfare. china s military has not fought a war in decades, but faces what the government calls a complex security environment, such as nuclear armed north korea and territorial disputes in the south china sea and over self ruled taiwan, claimed by china as its own.

" uzbekistan has abruptly recalled thousands of school teachers, college students and healthcare workers from cotton fields, halting a practice condemned abroad as forced labor, government officials and other sources told reuters on friday. the central asian nation is one of the world s leading cotton exporters and for years it has mobilized the students as well as staff at schools and clinics to pick the autumn harvest. it phased out using minors in 2015 under international pressure that included boycott campaigns. officially, the work is voluntary and paid at about $0.005 per kilogram. in reality those who refuse risk expulsion or the sack unless they bribe an official or hire someone to work in their place, sources said. the harvest started this month but late on thursday the tashkent government ordered the cotton pickers home, said a district official who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to comment. the government declined to comment. a central government official who also asked not to be named said an order barring the use of such workers had in fact been issued in august. on thursday tashkent warned regional governors they would be sacked if they fail to comply with it. the district official said regional governments have been ordered to hire unemployed locals for cotton picking instead. several students and a school director, who all requested anonymity, said they had been ordered to return to class or had their trips to the field canceled at the last moment. despite ending the use of child labor, uzbekistan ranked among the top five worst offenders in the global slavery index compiled last year by activist group walk free foundation. the group estimated that almost 4 percent of uzbekistan s population   then 31 million   lived in  modern slavery,  putting it second only to north korea by that metric. the move to end the practice follows reforms by president shavkat mirziyoyev who took over the former soviet republic after the death of strongman leader islam karimov last september. mirziyoyev has moved to liberalize foreign exchange and travel regulations and had about 16,000 people struck off a blacklist of potential extremists, reforms that may help him rebuild ties with the west and attract foreign investment.

" some key u.s. senators still had concerns about the republican tax bill in the senate, as a procedural motion to formally open debate on the measure was approved on wednesday. here is a list of republicans pivotal to the bill’s fate. the moderate senator from maine has qualms about republicans’ plan to include in the tax bill a repeal of a federal fee imposed on people who do not comply with obamacare’s “individual mandate.” the fee is meant to encourage young, healthy people to get health insurance so that premiums are affordable for old, sick people. collins and others fear repealing the fine would drive up insurance premium costs, canceling out tax cut gains that many of their constituents might get from the tax bill.      collins said republican leaders had promised her to take up two healthcare provisions before the end of the year to help mitigate the impact of repealing the fee. those provisions would help insurers cover expensive patients and continue obamacare subsidy payments for low income people for two years. collins has also prepared an amendment to the tax bill to make state and local property tax deductible up to $10,000, a provision that is part of the house of representatives’ tax bill. both the senate and house bills end deductibility of state and local tax income and sales tax. unlike the house bill, the senate bill ends property tax deductibility too.  collins sidestepped a question on whether she would vote for the tax bill. she said: “we’re doing this one step at a time.” the senator from alaska will vote for the tax bill, she wrote on twitter on wednesday evening.  murkowski said a number of the bill’s features were “very attractive,” noting that it would lower tax rates, double the child tax credit and double the standard deduction. she said it also included a provision she had written, to open the arctic national wildlife refuge, or anwr, to oil and gas drilling.  murkowski said it was important to enact reforms separately to help stabilize the individual market in health insurance. the montana republican has concerns about the bill’s treatment of “main street” businesses. he said on wednesday he had secured an agreement to increase a 17.4 percent deduction for owners of pass through businesses to 20 percent. the senator from wisconsin also has demanded more favorable treatment for “pass through” businesses, which include sole proprietorships and partnerships, as a condition of his support. corker, a deficit hawk from tennessee, said on tuesday he had the outlines of a deal adding a tax snap back provision to the bill that would raise taxes automatically if economic growth targets are not hit in the future to offset a higher deficit. corker said that arrangement would satisfy his concerns that the tax cuts could add too much to the national debt. as of wednesday evening, the details had not been announced. the snap back proposal also became a target of growing criticism among conservative republicans and lobbyists. the tax bill was expected to add $1.4 trillion to the $20 trillion national debt over 10 years.  the arizona conservative said on wednesday he was more comfortable with the tax bill because of indications there would be provisions in it to protect against ballooning the deficit. flake told national public radio he was concerned about “gimmicks,” but liked other parts of the bill, especially the corporate tax cut. the arizona maverick and former presidential nominee sidestepped questions on monday about how he would vote on the tax bill, telling reporters in the hallway to “stay tuned.”  like corker and flake, oklahoma’s lankford questions whether tax revenues from economic growth will compensate for the expected increase in the national debt under the tax plan. he has been working with them to “trigger” more revenues if needed. the kansas lawmaker is also wary of the impact on the national debt, pointing to his own state’s recent experience of fiscal problems following tax cuts.

" the saudi led coalition s blockade of yemen, which has cut off food imports to a population where 7 million people are on the brink of famine, is  illegal collective punishment  of civilians, a prominent aid official said on thursday. major agencies said aid was still blocked a day after the saudi led military coalition said it would let humanitarian supplies in. the u.s. backed coalition fighting houthi rebels in yemen said on wednesday it would allow aid in through the port of hodeidah, as well as u.n. flights to the capital sanaa, more than two weeks after blockading the country.  we have not yet had any movement as of now,  said jens laerke, spokesman of the u.n. office for the coordination of humanitarian assistance. jan egeland, a former u.n. aid chief who now heads the norwegian refugee council, said of the blockade:  in my view this is illegal collective punishment.   egeland, whose group helps 1 million yemenis, welcomed the coalition announcement as a  step in the right direction , but added:  we only have it in writing now and haven t seen it happen.  the coalition closed air, land and sea access on nov. 6 to stop the flow of arms to the houthis from iran. the action came after saudi arabia intercepted a missile fired toward riyadh. iran has denied supplying weapons.  sending a missile in the direction of riyadh is really very bad. but those who are suffering from the blockade had nothing to do with this missile,  egeland told reuters while in geneva.   even if both the flights and humanitarian shipments will go through now, it is not solving the underlying crisis that a country that needs 90 percent of its goods imported is not getting in commercial food or fuel.  houthi authorities who control the capital sanaa were also imposing restrictions on access for aid workers, he said. the united nations says some 7 million yemenis are on the brink of famine and 945,000 have been infected since april with cholera. more than 2,200 people have died. u.n. officials have submitted requests to the coalition for deliveries via hodeidah and sanaa, and the  hope and expectation  was that the vital aid pipelines would re open on friday, the u.n. s laerke said. the international committee of the red cross said it was vital to get commercial traffic resumed.  yemenis will need more than aid in order to survive the crisis and ward off famine,  spokeswoman iolanda jaquemet said.

" russian president vladimir putin hosted saudi arabia s king salman for talks at the kremlin on thursday, cementing a relationship that is pivotal for world oil prices and could decide the outcome of the conflict in syria. king salman, the first sitting saudi monarch ever to visit russia, led a delegation to moscow that agreed joint investment deals worth several billion dollars, providing much needed investment for a russian economy battered by low oil prices and western sanctions. saudi arabia said it had signed a memorandum of understanding on the purchase from russia of s 400 air defense systems. that marked a shift for the kingdom, which buys most of its military kit from the united states and britain. on the political front, there was no sign of any substantial breakthrough on the issues that have long divided moscow and riyadh, including the fact that they back rival sides in syria s war. however, any discord was eclipsed by mutual expressions of respect, and the pomp and ceremony laid on by russian officials to greet the saudi king.  on his journey into central moscow from vnukovo airport late on wednesday, king salman s limousine passed billboards bearing his photograph and messages in russian and arabic welcoming him. on thursday, putin received the monarch in the gold decorated st. andrew hall, one of the grandest spaces in the kremlin, attended by soldiers in ceremonial dress and with an orchestra playing their countries  national anthems.  i am sure that your visit will provide a good impulse for the development of relations between our two states,  putin told king salman later as they sat alongside each other in the kremlin s lavishly decorated green parlour. russia and saudi arabia, despite their differences, have been drawn together by a common interest in propping up flagging world oil prices, and by the fact that moscow, since its military intervention in syria, has clout in the middle east that other players in the region cannot ignore.  the saudi king invited putin to visit his country   an offer the russian leader accepted   and said they planned to keep cooperating to keep world oil prices stable. moscow and riyadh worked together to secure a deal between opec and other oil producers to cut output until the end of march 2018, helping support prices. energy minister khalid al falih said saudi arabia was  flexible  regarding moscow s suggestion to extend the pact until the end of next year. the message of further joint saudi russia action on output helped push up oil prices on thursday. brent crude was up more than 2 percent at $57.12 a barrel by 1615 gmt. in syria, riyadh supports rebels fighting president bashar al assad s army, while russian and iranian forces have sided with assad. this leaves moscow aligned with saudi arabia s arch rival iran, whose influence riyadh fears is growing in the region. briefing the media after the talks, russian foreign minister sergei lavrov focused on the common ground, saying the two leaders had agreed on the importance of fighting terrorism, finding peaceful solutions to conflicts in the middle east, and on the principle of territorial integrity. his saudi counterpart, adel al jubeir, said new horizons had opened for russia saudi ties that he could not previously have imagined.   relations between russia and saudi arabia have reached a historical moment,  said jubeir, speaking through an interpreter.  we are certain that the further strengthening of russian saudi relations will have a positive impact on strengthening stability and security in the region and the world.  a package of investments announced during the visit will go some way to plugging the vacuum left by sluggish western investment in russia that is, in part, a result of sanctions imposed after moscow annexed crimea in 2014. among the deals was an agreement between russian sovereign wealth fund rdif and saudi arabia s public investment fund to invest up to $100 million in transport projects in russia. the two countries also signed a deal to set up a $1 billion joint investment fund.  another memorandum of understanding was signed under which russian petrochemicals firm sibur would explore cooperation with saudi arabia.  rdif head kirill dmitriev said his fund was interested in partnering with saudi investors to acquire a minority stake in russian oilfield services firm eurasia drilling. absent from the slew of deals was any agreement on saudi aramco taking a stake in an arctic liquefied natural gas project run by russia s novatek. russian energy minister alexander novak said earlier this month that saudi officials were studying joint gas projects with novatek. however, aramco chief executive amin nasser said such a deal was not being discussed at this stage.

" colombia s disarmed farc rebel group is preserving its famous acronym as it becomes a civilian political party, part of its demobilization under a peace deal with the government to end more than 50 years of war. the revolutionary armed forces of colombia rebels, whose first political conference will close on friday with a concert and speeches in bogota s central square, will now go by revolutionary alternative common force, preserving the spanish initials. under the 2016 peace deal to end its part in a war that has killed more than 220,000 people, most of the group s fighters  were granted amnesty and allowed to participate in politics. whether the rebels will get backing from colombians, many of whom revile them, remains to be seen. the group had originally floated several other names, including others which kept the initials, but the new name won against new colombia in voting at the conference on thursday, farc leader rodrigo londono, known by his nom de guerre timochenko, said on twitter. farc leadership and social media accounts also posted a graphic of the party s policy priorities and its new logo, a red rose with a red star in the middle. policies will included the fight against corruption and promoting arts and culture.  no more traditional political parties and their corrupt policies. transparency and truth will guide the actions of the new party,  the graphic reads.  youth, women, indigenous people, rural farmers, afro colombians, artists, the lgbti population, housewives, students, workers and the unemployed   everyone s opinion matters.  the farc s often old fashioned marxist rhetoric strikes many as a throwback to their 1964 founding, but proposals for reforms to complicated property laws could get traction with rural voters who struggle as subsistence farmers. under the peace accord, farc s party will have 10 automatic seats in congress through 2026 and may campaign for others.  both legislative and presidential elections are set for 2018.

" venture capitalists and startup executives, who had mounted a campaign against a proposal to change how the federal government taxes stock options, expressed relief on wednesday after the u.s. senate dropped the measure from its tax overhaul plan. the senate tax bill had proposed taxing employee stock options, a crucial part of compensation at technology startups, as they vest. options generally vest over a four year period. the result would have been annual tax bills for startup employees that soared into the tens of thousands of dollars, warned startup founders and employees. startup options give employees the right to purchase shares in the future and are illiquid, meaning employees cannot spend or save their options. the senate removed that provision late tuesday night following heavy lobbying from the national venture capital association, the industry trade group, and an outpouring of opposition from silicon valley venture capitalists and entrepreneurs. they predicted the demise of the startup industry should the tax become law. “the entrepreneurial ecosystem can breathe a sigh of relief,” said bobby franklin, president and chief executive of the trade association. more than 600 startups, investors and executives from companies such as uber, airbnb and stripe signed a letter tuesday to senate finance committee chairman orrin hatch, urging him to remove the provision. “this shift would have profound negative consequences for technology startups by, among other things, undermining their ability to compete with large incumbents for employees,” they wrote in the letter, organized by technology advocacy group engine. a spokesman for hatch did not respond to a request for comment. the current tax code taxes employees only when they exercise their options. the senate proposal would have required employees to pay regular income tax on the value gain of stock options even before cashing them in. the national venture capital association (nvca) was also successful in getting a similar proposal removed from the original house tax reform bill. “we don’t anticipate it coming back up again,” said ben veghte, spokesman for the nvca. in the new version of the senate bill, the finance committee also added language that would enable startup employees to defer for five years their stock options tax bill if they reach the deadline to exercise them but the company is still private and shares do not trade on the public markets. venky ganesan, managing director of menlo ventures, called the changes “consistent with economic growth and job creation.” ",0
" canada said on wednesday that defense contractors would be allowed to sell weapons such as automatic firearms and electric stun guns to ukraine, a move the government in kiev has long pressed for. the canadian foreign ministry said in a statement it would closely examine every bid and noted that  exportation of these items is limited.   ukraine, which says it needs the weapons to help counter russian backed separatists who have occupied eastern parts of the country, also wants to buy arms from the united states. washington though has yet to make a decision.  in september, russian president vladimir putin warned the united states not to supply ukraine with defensive weapons. a war in eastern ukraine between pro russian separatists and ukrainian government forces has killed more than 10,000 people in three years. around 200 canadian troops are stationed in ukraine to help train local soldiers. the mission is due to end in march 2019. canadian foreign minister chrystia freeland is a strong critic of russia, in particular its decision in 2014 to annex the ukrainian region of crimea.

" zimbabwe s top general said on monday talks were planned between president robert mugabe and former vice president emmerson mnangagwa, whose sacking by the 93 year old leader two weeks ago triggered a coup. general constantino chiwenga, head of the armed forces and leader of the takeover codenamed  operation restore legacy , told a media conference he was encouraged by contact between the two men and mnangagwa would be back in the country soon.  thereafter, the nation will be advised on the outcome of talks between the two,  he said, reading from a statement. earlier, zimbabwe s ruling zanu pf resolved to bring a motion in parliament on tuesday to impeach mugabe, after a noon deadline expired for the besieged leader to resign and bring the curtain down on nearly four decades in power. impeachment could see mugabe kicked out in days and would be an ignominious end to the career of the  grand old man  of african politics, once lauded as an anti colonial hero. in the draft motion, the party accused mugabe of being a  source of instability , flouting the rule of law and presiding over an  unprecedented economic tailspin  in the last 15 years. it also said he had abused his constitutional mandate to favor his unpopular wife grace, 52, whose tilt at power triggered the backlash from the army that brought tanks onto the streets of the capital last week. mnangagwa s removal was meant to boost her chances of succeeding her husband. on paper, the impeachment process is long winded, involving a joint sitting of the senate and national assembly, then a nine member committee of senators, then another joint sitting to confirm his dismissal with a two thirds majority. however, constitutional experts said zanu pf, in revolt against mugabe, could push it through quickly.  they can fast track it. it can be done in a matter of a day,  said john makamure, executive director of the southern african parliamentary support trust. mugabe s demise, now apparently inevitable, is likely to send shockwaves across africa. a number of entrenched strongmen, from uganda s yoweri museveni to democratic republic of congo s joseph kabila, are facing mounting pressure to step aside. mugabe was once admired as the  thinking man s guerrilla , a world away from his image in his latter years as a dictator who proudly declared he held a  degree in violence . as the economy crumbled and opposition to his rule grew in the late 1990s, mugabe tightened his grip in the southern african country of 16 million, seizing white owned farms, unleashing security forces to crush dissent and speaking of ruling until he was 100. zanu pf s action follows a weekend of high drama in harare that culminated in reports mugabe had agreed to stand down   only for him to dash the hopes of millions of his countrymen in a bizarre and rambling national address on sunday night. flanked by the generals who sent in troops last week to seize the state broadcaster, mugabe spoke of the need for national unity and farming reform, but made no mention of his own fate.  i am baffled. it s not just me, it s the whole nation,  shocked opposition leader morgan tsvangirai told reuters.  he s playing a game.  two senior government sources told reuters mugabe had agreed on sunday to step aside and cnn said on monday his resignation letter had been drawn up, with terms that included immunity for him and grace. two other political sources told reuters on monday mugabe had indeed agreed to resign but zanu pf did not want him to quit in front of the military, an act that would have made its  intervention last week look more like a coup. another political source said mugabe s opponents had hoped his televised speech would  sanitize  the military s action, which has paved the way for mnangagwa, a former security chief known as the crocodile, to take over. moments after the address, war veterans  leader chris mutsvangwa, called for a wave of protests if mugabe refused to go. in london, a spokesman for british prime minister theresa may said mugabe had clearly lost the support of his people. since last week, mugabe has been confined to his lavish  blue roof  residence in harare, apart from two trips to state house to meet the generals and one to a university graduation ceremony at which he appeared to fall asleep. grace and at least two senior members of her  g40  political faction are believed to be holed up in the same compound. on saturday, hundreds of thousands took to the streets of  harare to celebrate mugabe s expected downfall and hail a new era for their country, whose economy has imploded under the weight of economic mismangement. inflation reached 500 billion percent in 2008. an estimated 3 million zimbabweans have emigrated to neighboring south africa in search of a better life. the huge crowds on the streets have given a quasi democratic veneer to the army s intervention. behind the euphoria, however, some zimbabweans have misgivings.   the real danger of the current situation is that, having got their new preferred candidate into state house, the military will want to keep him or her there, no matter what the electorate wills,  former education minister david coltart said. others worry about mnangagwa s past, particularly as state security chief in the early 1980s, when an estimated 20,000 people were killed in the so called gukurahundi crackdown by the north korean trained fifth brigade in matabeleland. he has denied any wrongdoing but critics say zimbabwe risks swapping one army backed autocrat for another.  the deep state that engineered this change of leadership will remain, thwarting any real democratic reform,  said miles tendi, a zimbabwean academic at oxford university.

" a trip to beijing last week by zimbabwe s military chief was a  normal military exchange , china s foreign ministry said on wednesday, after the military in the southern african nation seized power. zimbabwe s military took control targeting  criminals  around president robert mugabe but gave assurances on national television that the 93 year old leader and his family were  safe and sound . general constantino chiwenga met chinese defence minister chang wanquan in beijing on friday, where chang expressed a willingness to promote relations with zimbabwe, china s defence ministry said in a short statement last week. the ministry showed a picture of the two men, both wearing military uniform, shaking hands, and another one of officers from both countries sitting opposite each other holding a meeting at the people s liberation army headquarters in beijing. asked whether chiwenga had briefed china on plans to seize power, chinese foreign ministry spokesman geng shuang said the defence ministry had already released information about his trip and that he didn t have an understanding about the specifics of his reception in china.  i can only tell you that his visit to china this time was a normal military exchange mutually agreed upon by china and zimbabwe,  geng said, referring other questions to the defence ministry, which has yet to respond to a request for comment.  as a country that is friendly with zimbabwe, we are paying close attention to developments of the situation in zimbabwe,  geng added.   maintaining peaceful and stable development accords with the fundamental interests of zimbabwe and regional countries, and is the common desire of the international community. we hope the relevant parties in zimbabwe appropriately handle their internal matters.  in contrast to his elevated status on the continent, mugabe is reviled in the west as a despot whose disastrous handling of the economy and willingness to resort to violence to maintain power destroyed one of africa s most promising states. china and zimbabwe have a close diplomatic and economic relationship and beijing has stood with mugabe s government in the face of western economic sanctions. in august, zimbabwe s government said a chinese company planned to invest up to $2 billion to revive operations at zimbabwe iron and steel company (zisco), which ceased production in 2008 at the height of zimbabwe s economic meltdown. that same year, china vetoed a proposed western backed u.n. resolution which would have imposed an arms embargo on zimbabwe and financial and travel restrictions on mugabe and 13 other officials, saying it would  complicate , rather than ease, conflict.

" a philippine college fraternity used its annual naked run on friday to protest against president rodrigo duterte s brutal war on drugs and the imposition of martial law in the south in the army s fight against islamist militants. the masked and hooded young men sprinted in the nude through their college, holding signs reading  lift martial law  and  stop the killings , as bystanders laughed and pointed and others took photos.  the level of violence in society is growing and the fraternity cannot simply ignore that, that thousands of people are dying , alpha phi omega spokesperson thomas roca said, when asked why the fraternity picked the protest theme this year.   since taking office last june, duterte has launched a ferocious war of drugs that has left thousands of filipinos dead, and in may, he imposed martial law in mindanao, an island of 22 million people, when islamic state linked militants took over large parts of the city of marawi. this is not the first time the fraternity has taken a political stance with its yearly bare bottomed event.  the society used its naked run during the rule of late dictator ferdinand marcos in the 1980s to protest against the censorship of activists at the university of the philippines. for a finale on friday, the men gathered by a pond, arms slung over each other s shoulders, and lustily sang their fraternity song, alumni members in the audience joining in as well.   it s my first time seeing this , college student haji viado said, with a smile.  but for me what they did was effective to get people s attention on these issues.

" spanish rescue services pulled three drowned men from the strait of gibraltar after rescuing one man from a half sunken, rickety boat and another from the open sea, an emergency services spokeswoman said on wednesday. the men are believed to be from a boat that was carrying migrants attempting to cross into europe, the spokeswoman said. one of the rescued men said there were six people aboard originally, she said. the search continues for the sixth person. conditions in the strait of gibraltar   a narrow strip of water that connects the atlantic ocean to the mediterranean sea   are currently dangerous with bad weather and big waves, she said.  tens of thousands of migrants attempt the treacherous crossing of the mediterranean sea from africa every year in unseaworthy boats, leading to thousands of deaths by drowning. migrant drownings have topped 3,000 on mediterranean sea routes for the fourth straight year, the international organization for migration said on tuesday. migrants seeking a better life in europe have sought new routes through spain in an effort to get around european union actions to curb migration in the central and eastern mediterranean. almost 10,300 people arrived in spain by sea in the first seven months of 2017, the iom said in september, four times as many as in 2016.

" the obama administration’s top supreme court lawyer is leaving office at the end of june having won a string of major cases including fending off challenges to president barack obama’s signature healthcare law and legalizing same sex marriage. solicitor general donald verrilli has served in the justice department post since june 2011. he also held two other positions in the obama administration. verrilli’s deputy, ian gershengorn will take over, the justice department said in a release announcing verrilli’s departure. “for five years, solicitor general don verrilli has fought in our nation’s highest court for a better future, winning landmark cases that moved america forward,” obama said in a statement. verrilli twice successfully defended the 2010 affordable care act, known as obamacare, against conservative challenges. in 2012, the court ruled 5 4 to uphold the law against a broad legal attack. three years later, the justices rejected a second challenge on a 6 3 vote. “thanks to his efforts, 20 million more americans now know the security of quality, affordable health care,” obama said. in other major victories, verrilli urged the justices to strike down the federal defense of marriage act, which barred the recognition of same sex marriages for the purposes of federal benefits. the 5 4 ruling striking down the law in june 2015 helped pave the way for the court’s 5 4 landmark 2015 decision that legalized gay marriage nationwide, which verrilli also advocated for.  in another case, verrilli successfully persuaded the court in 2012 to strike down provisions of a harsh anti immigrant law in arizona on a 5 3 vote. “through these and many other cases – and through his thoughtful counsel and principled advocacy – don has built a legacy of inclusion, expanding opportunities and civil rights for all americans and moving our country forward,” attorney general loretta lynch said in a statement. setbacks included the court’s 2013 ruling on a 5 4 vote striking down a key provision of the voting rights act, a law enacted to protect minority voters. he also lost a case 9 0 in which a company challenged obama’s authority to appoint members of the national labor relations board when the senate was in recess. the court has yet to rule in several major cases verrilli argued this year, including a challenge to a restrictive texas abortion law and his defense of obama’s executive action that would protect more than four million immigrants from deportation.

"chris christie s campaign has signaled that the new jersey governor has finally read the writing on the wall and will announce the end of presidential campaign soon. it s surely a victory for america (although probably disappointing for new jersey residents) to see christie return from whence he came, but amid the celebrations let s remember: there were some good times too.like when christie single-handedly destroyed marco rubio s chances of ever being president.it will go down in history as one of 2016 s defining political moments. live and on the debate stage, a combative christie managed to utterly embarrass the ill-prepared, shallow marco rubio in a matter of seconds. in an election that has been far too consumed with cheap talking points and heavily-rehearsed performance art, we got to see, in that instant, the moment two candidates stopped being polite and started being real.rubio crumpled   and it was painful to watch.it s hard to know what rubio was thinking after getting so completely shut down   in fairness, it s hard to think above the noise of whirring of gears and cpu cooling fans   but afterwards the effect was clear. the candidate most journalists had already ordained as the presumptive republican nominee was dead in the water. rubio s campaign limps on, but in the way a ghost might if his end was so sudden he never realized he died at all.the washington post s dana milbank puts it better:tuesday night, rubio proved true the axiom popularized by alan simpson, the wisecracking former senator from wyoming:  one day you re the toast of the town, the next you re toast. now, to be clear, let s not give christie too much credit for his kamikaze finish. the infamous blowhard was   and remains   a complete asshole. his quest to take down his opponents doesn t stem from some higher moral principles   he just likes being a bully. returning to new jersey, he will go on being a bully. that s christie s whole shtick. in this light, christie s rubio takedown was a joker-like desire just to see the world burn. he takes down rubio because he can, not because he wants to.but regardless of motives, christie was a refreshing change of pace. trump also insults his fellow candidates, but his diminished intellect and massive ego mean that they are typically low-blows, potshots and vulgarity. christie, having practiced the artform numerous times against teachers and nurses, is capable of bullying on the next level.now christie returns to new jersey, a place where most residents despise him and most attorneys have grown fat off his nearly-endless stream of self-induced scandals. at one time he was considered a republican frontrunner. it never panned out. instead, he ll have to be content with the idea that while there will never be a chris christie white house, there won t be a marco rubio one either thanks to him.we all have our parts to play. maybe this one is christie s.feature image from screengrab ",1
" u.s. president donald trump was poised on tuesday to nominate washington lawyer marvin kaplan to the national labor relations board, nudging the agency toward a republican majority that could overturn a series of decisions that have riled businesses. late on monday, the white house issued a statement saying trump had selected kaplan, a fellow republican currently with the federal occupational safety and health review commission, to one of the board’s five seats. after trump officially names him, he must be confirmed by the u.s. senate.  the nlrb, which oversees union elections and disputes between workers, unions, and employers, has been controlled by democrats for nearly a decade, and they currently have a 2 1 majority with two vacancies. the board, when fully stocked, includes three members from the president’s party and two from the opposing party. under trump, lawyers and business groups expect the board to roll back a series of policy changes adopted during the administration of former president barack obama.  chief among those was a 2015 decision that expanded the circumstances in which a company is considered a “joint employer” liable for legal violations by contractors, staffing agencies, and franchisees.  the nlrb is also expected to revisit new rules designed to speed up the union election process that business groups say favor unions, and decisions allowing workers to use company email accounts to organize and to picket on employers’ private property. kaplan, who did not respond to a request for comment on tuesday, previously worked for republicans in the u.s. house of representatives crafting employment related legislation, including a bill that would undo the new union election rules. business groups including the national restaurant association and international franchise association praised the nomination, saying kaplan and a second nominee who trump is expected to name this week would bring more balance to the board.

" u.s. vice president mike pence will underscore the u.s. partnership with israel during a trip to the middle east next week while seeking to shore up u.s. relations with the arab world after president donald trump recognized jerusalem as the capital of israel. pence, a strong supporter of trump s decision, will spend three days in the region with stops in israel and egypt, the first high level official to visit after the president reversed decades of u.s. policy and announced the united states would start the process of moving its embassy from tel aviv. the status of jerusalem, which holds muslim, jewish and christian holy sites, is one of the thorniest obstacles to a peace deal between israel and the palestinians, who were furious over trump s move and have declined to meet with pence. the international community does not recognize israeli sovereignty over the full city. israel considers jerusalem its eternal capital, while palestinians want the capital of an independent state of theirs to be in the city s eastern sector, which israel captured in the 1967 middle east war and annexed in a move never recognized internationally. pence, an evangelical christian who had planned to highlight the plight of christian minorities during his trip, will not meet with palestinian christians or with officials from the coptic christian church, who declined a meeting in response to the u.s. move.  officials said pence still would discuss the persecution of christians as well as the jerusalem decision, countering iran, defeating islamic state militants and fighting  extremist ideology.  the dates of his trip have been in flux because of trump s u.s. tax overhaul push and the possibility that pence would be needed to provide a tie breaking vote in the senate.  he is now scheduled to depart washington on tuesday, arriving in cairo on wednesday for a meeting with egypt s president abdel fattah al sisi.   he flies to israel later on wednesday and will meet with prime minister benjamin netanyahu and president reuven rivlin,  deliver a speech to the israeli parliament, and visit jerusalem s western wall.  we can t envision a scenario under which the western wall would not be part of israel,  one administration official told reporters on a conference call. the trip will be dominated by the continuing fallout from trump s announcement.      the last couple weeks in the region have been a reaction to the jerusalem decision,  another administration official said.  this trip is part of ... the ending of that chapter, and the beginning of what i will say is the next chapter.  that view may not be shared by arab leaders. palestinian president mahmoud abbas said the united states abdicated its responsibility as a mediator on peace and pence s planned visit to bethlehem was scrapped. pence does not plan to encourage egypt to pressure the palestinians to return to the negotiating table, an official said.  we think it s appropriate for the palestinians to digest what has happened. and once they review the president s remarks clearly, they will realize that nothing has changed in terms of being able to reach an historic peace agreement,  he said. arab legislators have announced they will stay away from pence s speech to the knesset.  in egypt, the sisi government will have a chance to discuss the recent u.s. decision to suspend some of egypt s military aid package because of washington s concerns over civil liberties. egypt is a strategic u.s. partner because of its control of the suez canal and sisi presents himself as a bulwark against islamist militants in the region. on friday pence departs israel for germany, where he will visit u.s. troops on his way back to washington.

" the european union wants a transition period after brexit to end no later than dec. 31, 2020, according to the european commission s negotiating directives agreed on wednesday.  the transitional arrangements should apply as from the date of entry into force of the withdrawal agreement and should not last beyond 31 december 2020,  the published text showed.  coinciding with the end of the eu s current seven year budget period, the end of 2020, 21 months after brexit at the end of march 2019, had long been expected as the target end date of the transition but this was the first official confirmation that this is the official goal of the union negotiators. british prime minister theresa may had formally asked for a transition to last around two years. the four pages of new directives for eu chief negotiator michel barnier were in line with guidelines issued by eu leaders at a summit on friday and will form the basis of talks on the transition which barnier hopes to start next month. they spell out that britain will be effectively still a member of eu institutions, bound by all their rules including new ones, while not having a say in their making. the eu will also offer britain a non voting place at some meetings where decisions may affect specific issues and will set up special arrangements for a uk role in setting annual eu fishing quotas. the directives also spell out more clearly that eu treaties with other countries and international organizations will no longer apply to britain during the transition period. however, the document adds:  where it is in the interest of the union, the union may consider whether and how arrangements can be agreed that would maintain the effects of the agreements as regards the united kingdom during the transition period.  this has been important to britain since it could mean that it no longer benefits automatically from free trade agreements which the eu has with, say, canada or south korea, while, as the directives underline, it would still have to apply eu trade policy   for example collecting eu customs duty at uk ports. among elements spelled out more in the transition directives than in the leaders  guidelines last week was a repetition of a previously agreed eu position that everything applying to brexit for britain would also apply to other british territories. brussels has previously said the spanish government must agree any future arrangements with britain that affect the british territory of gibraltar on spain s southern coast.

" president elect donald trump is considering goldman sachs group inc president and chief operating officer gary cohn to head the white house budget office or to fill other positions, a trump transition official said on wednesday. cohn, 56, a former goldman commodities trader who joined the firm in 1990, has been widely considered to be the heir apparent to chief executive officer lloyd blankfein. dow jones reported earlier on wednesday that cohn, who met with trump on tuesday, has had discussions about leaving the firm. if cohn is picked to become trump’s budget director and is subsequently confirmed by the u.s. senate early next year, he would play a lead role in formulating spending priorities for domestic and international programs funded by washington. the budgets produced annually by the white house’s office of management and budget are a reflection of every administration’s legislative priorities and a blueprint for detailed spending and tax bills the president wants congress to consider. cohn has donated both to democrats and republicans over the years. he has given more recently to republicans, including $33,400 to the national republican congressional committee in 2015, according to campaign contribution records. they also showed that in 2007 and 2008, cohn donated to democrats barack obama and hillary clinton’s presidential campaigns. cohn is a former goldman commodities trader from ohio who joined the firm in 1990. he served in a variety of leadership roles in bond trading, becoming co head of goldman’s broader securities and eventually, co president in 2006. he makes frequent appearances at industry conferences and on television, where he speaks about the state of the financial markets.   cohn struggled with dyslexia as a child and bounced from school to school, according to a malcolm gladwell profile from his book “david and goliath.”  cohn is typically known throughout goldman for his direct and abrasive manner in dealing with colleagues, although he has become more polished in recent years, current and former executives said. leaving goldman to go to washington would not be the first time that cohn had taken a big risk.  he was given his first job on wall street after visiting the trading pit and sharing a cab with one of the traders to laguardia airport. although cohn knew nothing about trading options, he convinced the trader to give him an interview opportunity and he eventually landed a job on the floor of the commodities exchange.  “everything i’ve done in my career ... is to take risks,” cohn said in a 2009 speech at american university’s kogod school of business to new graduates.  alongside blankfein, cohn is one of the few senior executives left on wall street who navigated through the financial crisis. cohn’s co president, jon winkelried, left the firm in 2009.  but with blankfein showing no sign that he will step down soon, some inside the firm have wondered if cohn has other aspirations outside the wall street bank.  pacific investment management co in 2013 had considered cohn to replace mohamed el erian. but discussions never progressed beyond an initial stage, according to reports at the time.  while cohn does not have political experience, he is no stranger to capitol hill. cohn was a regular visitor to washington following the financial crisis, speaking to lawmakers and regulators about the markets, financial regulation and the commodities sector.  he has known sen. sherrod brown, the democratic senator from ohio, for years and has contributed to his campaign.  cohn met with lawmakers, including brown, in 2014 as goldman tried to defend its presence in the commodities market.  cohn is also friendly with rob portman, the ohio republican senator who renounced his support for trump in october. the two co hosted an event in 2013 in cleveland for small business owners who graduated from goldman’s 10,000 small business program.   cohn is just one of a cadre of other former goldman sachs executives who are slated to join the trump administration, including nominee for treasury secretary steven mnuchin and white house adviser steve bannon. with the u.s. senate and house of representatives both under republican control, trump’s budget proposals are likely to receive more serious consideration than budgets submitted over the past few years by president obama, who was regularly at odds with republican lawmakers.

" republican lawmakers and the federal reserve may be ready to strike a compromise deal on legislation that would give congress greater scrutiny over the central bank, now that there is no longer the threat of a presidential veto, but it would likely stop short of dictating rules on setting interest rates. donald trump’s victory in the presidential election will give the republicans control over both the white house as well as both houses of congress next month, removing a likely veto on legislation to overhaul governance of the fed by a democratic president. even so, republicans will need support from senate democrats now that their senate majority has shrunk to a 52 48 split in the november polls.  republicans who have been pushing for limits on the fed’s ability to decide policy believe the central bank has overstepped its mandate by using extraordinary measures to stimulate the economy since the financial crisis, and they say reforms are a priority next year. interviews with lawmakers, aides and top fed officials indicate there could be common ground for a deal, marking a possible departure from the central bank’s resolute opposition to reform. “there are different paths to a workable solution,” said representative bill huizenga, a republican who chairs the house of representatives subcommittee on monetary policy and trade. huizenga, who last year introduced legislation to tie policy decisions to a benchmark rule or risk “audits” by a congressional watchdog, told reuters that he was “open to what exactly” the audits would look like. “but it needs to be early, if not the first thing that we do.”  the trump administration and the federal reserve declined to comment on the potential for legislation or their positions.  huizenga’s bill last year would force the fed to operate under a directive rule like the one named after conservative economist john taylor, which prescribes interest rates based on levels of inflation, employment and growth. that would be a sea change from the way the fed has long operated, in which it reviews economic conditions as it weighs decisions on interest rates, but is free to set policy as it deems appropriate. the bill would leave room for discretion but would open the door for congress to launch real time reviews of rate decisions if the central bank strayed too far from the rule, something fed chair janet yellen called a “grave mistake” that would damage the bank’s credibility and distract its focus on longer term economic goals. under a strict taylor rule, the key federal funds rate   the rate at which banks lend money to other banks on an overnight basis   would be one to two percentage points higher now than it is, based on calculations by the federal reserve bank of cleveland.  huizenga’s proposal is now part of a broader bill championed by jeb hensarling, the influential republican chair of the house financial services committee, to winnow back financial regulations. hensarling has called fed reform a top priority and said he was willing to negotiate. because any such legislation would typically require a supermajority to pass the senate, republicans   who now hold only a simple majority   will need to compromise in order to win the support of some democrats. the fed could find other ways to satisfy demands for more insight. it could use its existing semi annual reports to congress to cite an array of well known monetary policy rules and explain how it arrived at its decisions with reference to those rules.  that could provide the desired transparency and even side step the threat of probes by a congressional watchdog. another alternative would be to make these audits scheduled, and not ad hoc, which could help curb any partisan challenges to policy in real time and preserve the fed’s flexibility during crises. still, those regular reviews would allow congress to see how federal reserve policymakers sifted through economic data and forecasts to reach rate decisions. now that the fed has begun raising rates, republicans complain it has offered a shifting set of reasons to move slowly, including political turmoil and market volatility overseas.  a hint of how compromise could be achieved came this summer when the cleveland fed published a list of seven well known policy rules and showed that their recommended rates varied between 0.14 percent and 3.08 percent.  the fed’s policy rate is now 0.25 0.5 percent and is expected to rise a quarter point this week.  “we do look at a number of rules ... but monetary policy isn’t a simple thing,” cleveland fed president loretta mester said in a recent interview. “i hope that any change that congress pushes through is done in a thoughtful way and doesn’t disrupt the benefits that we have in the current system.”  while there is no explicit reference to the fed’s swollen balance sheet in proposed legislation, hensarling and other critics have called for a firm plan to sell off the $3.5 trillion in treasury and mortgage bonds the central bank amassed in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis. the bond purchases were extraordinary measures taken to stimulate growth. many republican lawmakers say bond purchases inappropriately increases the fed’s role in the economy and amounts to financing of the government, a measure that is banned under statutes. critics say the fed’s plan to shed assets once interest rates have started normalizing is too vague, suggesting that could work its way into increased congressional oversight.  the fed maintains that its policies have been transparent in the face of a deep recession and frustratingly slow recovery. yellen and her colleagues also say the fed can best achieve its twin mandate of price stability, which it targets at 2 percent inflation, and maximum sustainable employment when free of short term political interference. it is close to both goals now. taken together, republicans’ pursuit of reforms makes future fed policy “a big global uncertainty,” said peter hooper, a former fed official who is chief economist at deutsche bank securities. it could lead to more aggressive rate hikes than the roughly two per year currently expected, and quicker trimming of the balance sheet, he said.  selling bonds, or even halting purchases of those maturing, would raise market yields and amount to tighter monetary conditions. getting a fed reform bill into trump’s hands “will require a consensus,” said representative frank lucas, another republican on the house monetary policy subcommittee. “to get there we would need to explain to the senate that this would not constrain the fed in any future crisis.”  lucas acknowledged concerns that the taylor rule would “dramatically alter” the fed’s flexibility, and told reuters his staff was considering possible adjustments to proposed bills.  that would appear to be something huizenga could live with. “they are already doing the analysis, so maybe it’s asking them to share that analysis,” huizenga told reuters, adding he hoped the election of trump caused fed leadership to “rethink its stiff arming” of reforms.

" about 20 asylum seekers on friday left an australian run detention center due to close down in papua new guinea, but hundreds of holdouts faced forcible eviction amid an immigration standoff that has blighted australia for years. nearly 600 men have barricaded themselves into the manus island center for more than 10 days without regular food or water, defying closure attempts by australia and papua new guinea in what the united nations calls a  looming humanitarian crisis . the deadline to move is saturday. the asylum seekers fear reprisals if they move to transit centers pending possible resettlement in the united states. the main camp was closed on oct. 31 and water and power have been cut off. some locals are angry at what they perceive as preferential treatment for the asylum seekers, many of them well educated, in a poor, rural society, and some of the detainees have come under attack when on release from the camp.  bowing to pressure from papua new guinea, which said it would forcibly evict and  apprehend  any holdouts on saturday, around 20 men left the camp for one of the transit centers, three asylum seekers told reuters. the rest vowed to stay put, setting the scene for a possible clash.  volker turk, assistant high commissioner for protection at u.n. refugee agency unhcr, called on both governments to exercise restraint and not to use violence, taking into account people who had been in the processing center for years.  they re in a very vulnerable state with not much hope in sight,  he said.  we have been visiting manus island several times over the last couple of years, we have reported on the very dire conditions in these centers. it s now really high time to bring an end to this unconscionable human suffering.   in sydney, about 200 protesters picketed a fundraiser for the ruling liberal party, heckling arriving guests and demanding that the men be allowed to settle on the mainland. in melbourne, more than 1,000 people held similar protests, the australian associated press news agency said.   australia has used the center, and a camp on the tiny pacific island of nauru, to detain asylum seekers who try to reach its shores by boat. it says boat arrivals will never enter australia, even if found to be refugees, as this would encourage people smugglers in asia. australia says the policy prevents people drowning at sea, but it has been widely condemned.  we aren t going to be stood over by people that have better accommodation to move to,  immigration minister peter dutton said in a radio interview. the u.n. human rights committee urged australia to bring its migration laws into line with world standards. it is concerned about conditions in manus and on nauru, citing safety fears and instances of assault, sexual abuse, self harm and suspicious deaths. the asylum seekers, drawn largely from afghanistan, iran, myanmar, pakistan, sri lanka, and syria, use rubbish bins to collect rainwater and set up makeshift shelters to protect against the tropical sun and rain. papua new guinea police returned to dismantle parts of the camp on friday, large parts of its fence having been removed the previous day.  they are destroying our shelters,  said behrouz boochani, a kurdish journalist from iran, detained for more than four years.  they destroyed the rubbish bins where we have been collecting water too.

" the obama administration told u.s. public schools on friday that transgender students must be allowed to use the bathroom of their choice, upsetting republicans and raising the likelihood of fights over federal funding and legal authority.  conservatives pushed back against the administration’s non binding guidance to schools, the latest battleground in the issue of rights for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender americans.  texas attorney general ken paxton said the guidance “must be challenged.” “if president obama thinks he can bully texas schools into allowing men to have open access to girls in bathrooms, he better prepare for yet another legal fight,”  paxton, a tea party champion, said in a statement. other republican led states joined calls to disregard the white house’s directive and accused the administration of overstepping its role. in north carolina, governor pat mccrory labeled the move a “massive executive branch overreach” and called on federal courts and the u.s. congress to intercede, while arkansas governor asa hutchinson said it was “offensive, intrusive and totally lacking in common sense.” the u.s. education and justice departments, in a letter, told school districts nationwide that while the guidance carries no legal weight, they must not discriminate against students, including based on their gender identity. the guidance contained an implicit threat that school districts defying the obama administration’s interpretation of the law could face lawsuits or be deprived of federal aid. the white house defended its actions, saying the guidance should not be viewed as a threat but instead as a set of “specific, tangible, real world advice and suggestions” that many schools had sought and will welcome. “that’s what we’re looking for: solutions that protect the safety and dignity of every single student in school,” white house spokesman josh earnest told reporters at a daily briefing, adding that the idea was to prevent discrimination against a range of groups extending beyond the transgender community.    the directive came as the justice department and north carolina are battling in federal court over a north carolina state law approved in march that prohibits people from using public restrooms not corresponding to their gender assigned at birth, while other states weigh similar measures. north carolina’s law was the first to ban people from restrooms in public buildings and schools not matching the sex on their birth certificate. mississippi has enacted legislation similarly viewed as discriminatory by civil and gay rights groups, and tennessee and missouri considered similar measures. the letter to the schools from washington said that, to get federal funding under existing rules, a school has to agree not to treat students or activities differently on the basis of sex. that includes not treating a transgender student differently from other students of the same gender identity, officials said. the american civil liberties union said the guidance would help make students “free to bring their whole selves to school.” in a sign of what defiant states may face, the justice department this week asked a u.s. district court in north carolina to declare the state in violation of the 1964 civil rights act and order it to stop enforcing the ban. americans are divided over which public restrooms should be used by transgender people, a reuters/ipsos poll showed, with 44 percent saying people should use them according to their biological sex and 39 percent saying they should be used according to the gender with which they identify. a group representing u.s. school boards called the guidance “unsettled law.” “a dispute about the intent of the federal law must ultimately be resolved by the courts and the congress,” the national school boards association said in a statement.  donald trump, the presumptive republican presidential nominee, was less critical than many of his party in several television interviews, saying the issue should be left up to individual states.  “everybody has to be protected ... but it’s a tiny, tiny portion of the population,” trump told fox news.

" state governors and city mayors were quick to claim the mantle of u.s. leadership in fighting climate change after president donald trump said on thursday the country will pull out of the paris climate agreement. the officials said they collectively could show the international community that the united states remained committed to cutting the emissions that scientists blame for global warming. governors and analysts cited moves including california’s effort to get 100 percent of its electricity from renewable sources, northeast states potentially tightening maximum allowances for carbon and oregon working on measures to put a price on carbon. “there is a pathway here where the rest of america in reaction to, really, what is an insane decision by president trump, takes the kind of steps needed,” california governor jerry brown told reuters.  more states could follow california and neighboring oregon’s lead on low carbon fuel standards, expand zero emission vehicle requirements and potentially merge carbon measures such as taxes, caps and trading, the governors and analysts said. “there is a possibility over time that states could increase their cap and trade markets and merge them, including across national boundaries, as has happened with quebec and california,” washington state governor jay inslee said in an interview with reuters, referring to regional carbon trading systems already in place in the northeast and west. inslee, brown and new york governor andrew cuomo on thursday announced the creation of a “climate alliance” for states committed to the paris goals.     trump announced his decision to withdraw from the paris accord, saying the its requirement to cut u.s. emission of carbon dioxide threatened millions of jobs and productivity. he said he would start a process that could last four years to withdraw from the deal, which has been signed by almost every other nation on earth. [l1n1iy0mv] the president used declining coal industry jobs as an example of his concern that the climate pledge was hurting u.s. workers. but critics of his move pointed out that renewable energy industries, particularly solar, are creating hundreds of thousands of jobs   far more than currently exist in coal. “this decision won’t bring back coal jobs in the united states. that train has left the station,” california state senate leader kevin de leon, a democrat, said of trump’s withdrawal. “clean energy is the future.” de leon introduced a bill that would require california get 100 percent of its retail electricity from renewables by 2045, and it passed the state senate on wednesday. california governor brown is heading to china on friday to lead a conference of states and other “subnational” actors making voluntary commitments to cut greenhouse grasses.  the group, the “under2” coalition, which takes its name from the paris accord’s effort to keep global warming below 2 degrees celsius, has grown to 170 jurisdictions representing more than a third of the global economy over the past two years   including 10 states in the united states. brown said he was exploring the possibility of integrating california and chinese provincial carbon trading systems. that would be a “heavy lift” he said, but “i am going to discuss that with the highest officials in china this week.” smaller states also aim to lead by example. connecticut department of energy and environmental protection chief rob klee said he was working on a program to build electric vehicle infrastructure. “what we believe we can do in connecticut is show the policies that can work,” he said. the u.s. commitment under paris of cutting emissions by 26 percent to 28 percent below 2005 levels by 2025 is ambitious, though. john larsen of rhodium group estimated the united states under trump policies was on track for a 15 percent to 19 percent reduction. “at this stage in the game, new experimentation at the state level with new policy options could be really, really important to not just meeting paris but driving emissions down in the long run,” he said. several cities said that they would work toward reaching the goal. “we are increasing investments in renewable energy and energy efficiency. we will buy and create more demand for electric cars and trucks,” a group of more than 50 mayors from cities ranging from houston, texas to new orleans, louisiana said in a statement on thursday. the various coalitions of states and cities said that they had the heft to command international attention. “clearly california is sort of the big dog in this pack, but our ability to work with california and washington and british columbia has a huge impact,” oregon governor kate brown told reuters.

"communities like ferguson, baltimore and now milwaukee, didn t ask for this war on cops, it was thrust upon them. it was organized, paid for and well-orchestrated by obama and other democrats players from a variety of backgrounds. former attorney general eric holder was caught paying protesters with taxpayer money to come to sanford, fl to march against george zimmerman in the trayvon martin case that got obama s race war/war on cops started back in march, 2012. with so many stories about the violence and crime coming out of milwaukee, a bright ray of hope comes from a prayer rally created by a community torn apart by obama s war on cops.a young girl bravely speaks out against the violence in her neighborhood. the sadness and despair in her shaking voice is truly heartbreaking. these people are trapped in a neighborhood overrun with crime, violence and despair. they re trapped in a neighborhood run by greedy democrat politicians who have substituted government control for self-respect and dignity. they have taken away these citizens desire to do better, they have stripped them of the belief that they truly can escape their situation. they ve set up planned parenthood abortion mills on every corner to keep their population down and have given them just enough to sustain themselves, but not too much to escape government control.rotten school officials and union leaders tasked with improving their education are only out for themselves, always looking for the next pay raise or special perk that comes with the job. what these self-serving politicians and school administrators are giving to these communities of mostly fatherless kids are a poor education, low self-esteem and no hope for a better life.these young adults are choosing a life of crime over a job. they re choosing to drop out of school instead of getting a job at a local fast-food restaurant while attending a local community college or technical training center. these young adults don t know, or understand the value of sacrificing today for a future tomorrow, because the democratic party has convinced them they don t need to worry about the future. they ve convinced them they don t need to be self-sufficient. the only thing they need is the government and that s enough. that s also the reason this frightened little girl seen in the video below, is trapped in this tragic neighborhood filled with violence and crime and may never get out as long as democrats continue to fool the voters in these crime-ridden cities they are on their side.thank goodness these citizens, (who are truly a ray of hope in these uncertain times) are able to turn to god for guidance and to ask for protection for their community, and for law enforcement officers who keep their neighborhoods safe.

" the trump administration wants to tax imports from countries that put tariffs on the united states, said gary cohn, director of president donald trump’s national economic council. “fair means we treat our trading partners the way they treat us,” cohn told a conference on the sidelines of the imf and world bank’s spring meetings in washington on thursday. “if you want to insist on having a tariff on a product, which we prefer you not, the president believes that we should treat you in a reciprocal fashion and that we should tax your product coming into the united states.” ",0
" pennsylvania governor tom wolf announced on wednesday that he has a “treatable form” of prostate cancer but said it would not interfere with his official duties. “i’m not going to be incapacitated at all by this,” wolf told reporters at a news conference alongside his wife, frances. “it’s eminently treatable.” the 67 year old democrat said he would begin a months long regimen of treatment within the coming weeks. he would not go into details of the treatment but described it as “minor” and “routine” and said it would not include chemotherapy. wolf, a businessman, defeated republican incumbent tom corbett in 2014. since his election, the state has been locked in a bitter budget battle. it still has only a partial spending plan for the current fiscal year, which began more than seven months ago. illinois, the u.s. state with the country’s lowest credit rating, is the only other state without a current budget in place. wolf and the republican controlled state legislature have been fighting over whether to implement a severance tax on natural gas producers, among other tax hikes, and use the revenues to increase education spending. wolf said his doctor found some abnormalities during a routine examination in late november or early december and that further testing had confirmed the cancer. “prostate cancer is something that older men get,” he said. “a lot of older men die with prostate cancer; not a lot die of it.” he said he hoped his announcement would reinforce the importance of getting annual checkups. other governors have also continued to work while undergoing treatment for cancer. maryland governor larry hogan, 59, a republican, pledged in june 2015 to keep working despite chemotherapy for advanced cancer of the lymph nodes. california governor jerry brown, 77, a democrat, kept a full schedule in 2012 while receiving treatment for prostate cancer.

" russia dismissed as false on thursday a reuters report that said a government think tank controlled by president vladimir putin had developed a plan to swing the 2016 u.s. presidential election in donald trump’s favor. reuters reported on wednesday that the moscow based russian institute for strategic studies (riss) had provided the framework and rationale for what u.s. intelligence agencies have concluded was an intensive effort by russia to interfere with the nov. 8 election. the reuters report cited three current and four former u.s. officials who had acquired two documents prepared by the institute. russia has repeatedly denied interfering in the u.s. election. the kremlin and riss did not respond to requests for comment on the documents before wednesday, but on thursday the think tank issued a statement saying the report was false. “it seems, that in their conspiratorial consciousness the authors of this conceit did not weigh reality against their coveted fantasies, in order to once again draw attention to the theme ... of russia’s ‘participation’ in the pre election campaign in the united states,” said riss director mikhail fradkov.  kremlin spokesman dmitry peskov said people should not pay attention to reports based on anonymous sources. “i don’t know anything about this, i can only say that seven anonymous sources are not worth one real one.” the documents obtained by the u.s. intelligence officials were central to the conclusion by the administration of barack obama that russia mounted a “fake news” campaign and launched cyber attacks against democratic party groups and hillary clinton’s campaign, the current and former officials said. that campaign began after putin asked the institute to draw up a plan for interfering with the u.s. presidential race, said one of the sources, a former senior u.s. intelligence official. u.s. president donald trump has said russia’s activities had no impact on the outcome of the race. ongoing congressional and fbi investigations into russian interference have so far produced no public evidence that trump associates colluded with the russian effort to change the outcome of the election.

" german rail operator deutsche bahn is facing a siege of online criticism over a proposal to name a high speed train after holocaust victim anne frank, who was deported by train to the auschwitz concentration camp. the idea to name the high speed ice 4 train after frank came from proposals made by deutsche bahn customers and the german public, which a panel reviewed. of 19,400 submissions, anne frank was one of the most popular names, it said.  aware of the historical responsibility we bear, we made a deliberate decision to help keep anne frank s memory alive,  bahn said in a statement.  it was not our intention to disrespect the memory of anne frank in any way whatsoever.  critics say the plan was insensitive. frank was deported from her home in amsterdam and taken to auschwitz by train in september 1944. she was later moved the bergen belsen concentration camp, where she died in early 1945. iris eberl, a conservative bavarian lawmaker, said on twitter the plan was  disrespectful. mirjam wenzel, director of the jewish museum in frankfurt, where frank was born, tweeted that the idea was  based on historical amnesia . the anne frank house, the museum that preserves the family s hiding place in amsterdam, said in a statement that the idea of naming the train after her  is painful for the people who experienced these deportations, and causes fresh pain to those who still bear the consequences of those times within them.

" observed from behind a one way mirror and heavy chain link fence, a handful of bearded detainees in baggy t shirts mill around inside a communal cellblock at the guantanamo bay military prison, vastly outnumbered by u.s. troops guarding them. this is the shrinking world of america’s notorious offshore prison, a scene that underscores how u.s. president barack obama is running out of time – and options – to meet his pledge to close the compound before he leaves office in january. obama has whittled down the number of prisoners to 80, the lowest since shortly after his predecessor george w. bush opened the facility to hold terrorism suspects rounded up overseas following the sept. 11, 2001, attacks. but the president faces political and legal obstacles that may prove insurmountable in his final push to empty the detention center at the u.s. naval station in cuba, according to some u.s. officials in washington. (graphic: tmsnrt.rs/1nmi52e) still, there were growing signs during a carefully scripted media tour this week that operations are beginning to wind down at the prison, where many cells now stand empty. as inmate numbers dwindle   the latest departures being nine yemenis sent to saudi arabia last weekend   participation also has ebbed in what was once a widespread hunger strike. fewer than five inmates are being force fed, the chief medical officer told reporters as he displayed a “restraint chair” of the type where prisoners are strapped down and nasal tubes inserted twice daily. but the 1,100 strong force of military personnel assigned to secure guantanamo’s far flung lockups, ranging from communal compounds for well behaved prisoners to solitary confinement for those considered most dangerous, has remained largely unchanged. that works out to about 14 guards for each current inmate. work inside the razor wire is labor intensive. squads of guards in protective visors swarmed through an eerily darkened corridor one lunch time, preparing to deliver meals in camp six, home to the most cooperative prisoners. unaware of being watched and recorded through the sound proof glass, detainees went about their routines. one waved over a guard and complained about not having enough pens for his artwork, while another sat at a steel table doing paperwork. in washington, republican lawmakers are readying for a legal battle if obama tries to move prisoners to u.s. soil. obama’s plan to close guantanamo, announced two months ago, hinges on bringing possibly dozens of remaining prisoners deemed too dangerous to release to maximum security prisons in the united states. but that would defy a congressional ban on such transfers. administration officials have not ruled out that obama might seek to bypass congress and resort to executive action to close the prison but say privately he probably won’t make a decision until after the november presidential election. republican frontrunner donald trump and his party rivals vow to keep the jail open if they win the white house. at its peak, guantanamo housed nearly 800 prisoners, becoming a symbol of the excesses of the “war on terror” and synonymous with accusations of torture. obama, whose promise to shutter the prison dates back to the 2008 campaign, has called it a recruitment tool for terrorists. nowadays, camp officials credit improved “compliance” by prisoners to a sense that release is getting closer. most have been held for more than a decade without charge or trial. only two detainees are listed for misconduct, which can entail anything from physically assaulting guards to “splashing them with bodily fluids,” said army colonel david heath, commander of the guantanamo guard force. hunger strikers, who numbered more than a hundred at the peak of their protest in 2013, are now just a handful and there is no longer any need for extraction teams to pull them from their cells for “enteral feeding” sessions, according to navy captain rich quattrone, head of the camp’s medical facilities. he insisted the process is “safe and humane.” but omar farah, attorney for tariq ba odah, a yemeni hunger striker who lost half his body weight and was among the group sent to saudi arabia, said force feeding was “utterly humiliating”. guantanamo officials remain mindful of other potential sources of trouble, especially given islamic religious sensitivities. for instance, when a reporter entered a model cell meant to display living conditions and began inspecting a bookshelf, camp officials rushed over and told her not to touch a copy of the koran. her cameraman was ordered to delete the scene. at the detainee library, where harry potter books are the most popular items, officials screen out anything deemed to promote jihadist themes or containing graphic violence or nudity.  inmates sometimes go a step further. a woman’s photo on the cover of an arabic language national geographic was scribbled over by a detainee apparently offended by her uncovered face.

" the u.s. military said on monday it had carried out an air strike against islamic state militants in northeast somalia, killing one person. islamic state has been gathering recruits in the region, although experts say the scale of its force is unclear and it remains a small player compared to the al shabaab group.  in coordination with the federal government of somalia, u.s. forces conducted an airstrike against isis, in northeastern somalia on nov. 27, killing one terrorist,  the u.s. africa command said in a statement. colonel ali abdi, a military officer in an area near the town of qandala in the semi autonomous puntland region, said the strike took place in hills near the town.  we heard a huge crash of air strike in the hilly areas of dasaan remote area behind qandala town this afternoon   abdi told reuters from dasaan.  after the strike the is militants ran away from there. we went to the scene and saw pieces of a dead body.   last month, a group loyal to islamic state seized a small port town in somalia s semi autonomous puntland region, the first town it has taken since emerging a year ago. the group, which refers to itself simply as islamic state, is a rival to the larger al shabaab force, which is linked to islamic state s rival al qaeda and once controlled much of somalia. early this month, the u.s. military carried out its first air strike against islamic state militants, killing several. last week, somalia s government said it had requested a u.s. air strike that killed scores of suspected militants to help pave the way for an upcoming ground offensive against al shabaab. earlier this year, the white house granted the u.s. military broader authority to carry out strikes in somalia against al shabaab.

" the u.s. senate on thursday delayed voting on a republican tax overhaul as the bill was tripped up by problems with an amendment sought by fiscal hawks to address a large expansion of the federal budget deficit projected to result from the measure. the senate debated the legislation late into thursday and adjourned, putting off any votes until friday morning. it was unclear if a decisive vote on the bill would occur then. the delay underscored nagging concerns among republican fiscal conservatives about the deficit impact of the bill. that set up the possibility that its deep tax cuts might have to be moderated, that future tax increases might be built in, and that some conservatives might seek to attach spending cuts, all approaches that could throw up new political problems. white house legislative affairs director marc short told reporters in the capitol: “i don’t think tax cuts are going to be scaled back. i think it would still be historic tax relief for corporations and for middle income families.”  the tax bill is seen by republicans as crucial to their prospects in the november 2018 elections, when they will fight to keep control of the senate and the house of representatives. since taking office in january, president donald trump and  republicans now in control of congress have yet to pass major legislation, a fact they hope to change with their proposed tax  code overhaul, which would be the biggest since the 1980s. democrats, expected to unanimously oppose the tax bill, have dismissed it as a giveaway to the wealthy and corporations. republican senator bob corker and others had tried to add a provision to the bill to trigger automatic future tax increases if the tax cuts in the bill did not boost the economy and generate revenues sufficient to offset the deficit expansion. but the senate parliamentarian barred corker’s “trigger” proposal on procedural grounds. the trigger amendment was needed to win corker’s vote and those of others worried about the deficit   worries that intensified when congressional analysts said the bill would not boost the economy enough to offset the estimated deficit expansion, as the trump administration had said it would. senate finance committee chairman orrin hatch told reporters in the capitol that it had not been easy to accommodate corker, senator jeff flake and other fiscal hawks. “it’s been pretty hard to make them happy so far. we’re going to keep working on it ... and we’re going to do it,” hatch said. senate republicans were considering making a proposed corporate income tax rate cut temporary, instead of permanent, so the rate would rise back to an unknown level after six or seven years, said one republican senator and an aide. by that time, trump might no longer be in office and a future congress might change the law. when asked if the tax bill was in trouble, republican senator mike rounds told reporters: “no, i don’t think so. it’s just a matter of once again trying to make the bill work.” optimism had reigned earlier in the day, when the bill won the backing of republican senator john mccain. stocks surged on hopes that a key tax overhaul vote was imminent. the s&p 500 hit a record closing high and the dow jones industrial average topped the 24,000 mark for the first time. but the joint committee on taxation, or jct, a nonpartisan fiscal analysis unit of congress, said the bill as passed earlier by the senate finance committee, would generate only $407 billion in new tax revenue from increased economic growth. jct had earlier estimated the tax bill would balloon the $20 trillion national debt by $1.4 trillion over 10 years. the new estimate, counting “dynamic” economic effects, put the deficit expansion at $1 trillion, far short of assertions by some republicans that the tax cuts would pay for themselves. house of representatives democratic leader nancy pelosi said the new jct estimate showed “no amount of dynamic scoring fairy dust will fix the catastrophic deficits of the gop tax scam.” mccain, a key player in july’s collapse of a republican effort to gut obamacare, backed the tax bill. while “far from perfect,” the party’s 2008 presidential nominee said it would boost the economy and help all americans. republican senator susan collins, who also played a role in the failure of the obamacare rollback, told reporters she was still not committed to the bill. several republicans were withholding support while pushing for including a federal deduction for up to $10,000 in state and local property taxes and bigger tax breaks for “pass through” companies, including small businesses. as drafted, the senate bill would cut the u.s. corporate tax rate to 20 percent from 35 percent after a one year delay and reduce the tax burden on businesses and individuals, while ending many tax breaks, but would still expand the deficit, trump wants to enact tax cuts before january. the house approved its own tax bill on nov. 16. it would have to be merged with the senate bill, if it is approved, before any final measure could go to trump for his signature.  republicans have 52 votes in the 100 member senate, giving them enough to win if they hold together. with democrats opposed, republicans could lose no more than two of their own votes, with vice president mike pence able to break a 50 50 tie. trump has attacked corker and flake on twitter. both senators are not seeking re election. in early october, the president called corker, “liddle’ bob corker” in a tweet. corker tweeted that the trump white house was an “adult daycare center.” days later, he called trump a liar who had damaged u.s. standing in the world. trump tweeted back saying corker “couldn’t get elected dog catcher.” trump earlier this month tweeted that flake’s political career was ‘toast’” in a dramatic senate speech, flake said u.s. politics had become inured to “reckless, outrageous and undignified” behavior from the white house.

" federal prosecutors on friday opposed a last ditch effort by new jersey senator robert menendez to allow periodic delays in his federal corruption trial in newark, new jersey, next month so that he can travel to washington to cast critical senate votes. u.s. district judge william walls on tuesday had rejected menendez’s request, saying the democrat was free to “absent himself” from testimony but did not deserve special treatment, being “no worse and no better than any other defendant.” in a filing on thursday, menendez said his “constitutional obligations” to his constituents justified altering the trial schedule so he could vote on raising the debt ceiling to avoid a government shutdown, rewriting the tax code and renewing the soon to expire national flood insurance program. republicans have a narrow senate majority, and menendez said july’s failed effort to repeal the affordable care act showed his absence from any vote could be “potentially determinative.” the trial is scheduled to begin on sept. 6. prosecutors on friday said the scheduling conflicts resulted from menendez’s lengthy, failed pursuit of a meritless argument that the constitution immunized him from prosecution. “no defendant should receive special treatment based on power or privilege,” prosecutors said. “this court should reject defendant menendez’s effort to let politics in washington dictate the trial schedule in newark.” menendez later countered that u.s. supreme court precedents and “common sense” justified an accommodation. it is unclear when the judge will rule on menendez’s request. the senator was charged with accepting campaign donations and gifts, including a stay at a caribbean villa and private jet flights, from co defendant salomon melgen in exchange for lobbying on the florida eye doctor’s behalf. both men have pleaded not guilty to fraud and bribery. jury selection was completed on wednesday. if menendez were found guilty and removed from the senate before new jersey governor chris christie completes his term on jan. 16, 2018, then christie, a republican, could name a replacement. christie’s successor could fill any subsequent vacancy. the case is u.s. v. menendez et al, u.s. district court, district of new jersey, no. 15 cr 00155.

" pakistan on wednesday told medical charity medecins sans frontieres  (msf) to stop work and leave its impoverished tribal areas that border afghanistan, the health organization said, ending its 14 year stay in the volatile region. msf works out of two health facilities in the kurram district of pakistan s federally administered tribal areas (fata) region, which has been plagued by militancy over the past decade and was the location of many u.s. drone strikes targeting commanders from al qaeda and other militant groups. though security has improved in fata in recent years, sectarian militant attacks, primarily targeting shi ite muslims, still occur. twin blasts in the kurram s most populous town, parachinar killed more than 75 people in june.  local officials say msf provides essential healthcare facilities in fata, an area with some of pakistan s poorest healthcare and lowest literacy rates.  we have been asked to close our medical activities in kurram agency,  msf said in a statement to the media, adding that pakistan had refused to issue a no objection certificate (noc) for the charity to work in the tribal areas.   msf is saddened by the decision from the authorities responsible for ngos working in kurram agency. the closure brings to and end 14 years of msf working with the fata health services in kurram agency,  country representative catherine moody said in the statement.   foreign nationals and organizations working in pakistan require nocs to operate in certain areas. pakistani ngos and journalists also face restrictions when working in the tribal areas.  msf provides diagnosis and treatment facilities to the community for leishmaniasis, immunization for children, as well ... responding to emergencies, disease outbreaks and mass casualties,  the organization said.  the region s health directorate did not respond to requests for comment but dr. mohammad ishaq, who works there, said msf was asked to leave because they did not have a valid noc.   i personally think msf was doing a great job for the patients in fata,  he said, adding that he did not know why its license to work there was revoked.   we have been working in fata since 2004. we were never denied an noc in  the past. this will affect many patients in the area,  one msf employee said, asking not to be identified. he added that the organization had 70 staff members working at the two health facilities.  the official who notified msf that their operations would need to be shut down added:  i did what i was directed to by my bosses in peshawar but really don t know the reason behind msf being stopped.

" an ambitious asia pacific trade pact linking the united states and 11 countries lay in tatters on tuesday after u.s. president elect donald trump said he would kill the deal on his first day in office on jan. 20. trump’s statement appeared to open the way for china to assume the united states’ leadership mantle on trade and diplomacy in asia. the republican termed the trans pacific partnership (tpp) “a potential disaster for our country.” china, japan and south korea are already in the initial stages of discussing a trilateral trade deal, and beijing has been pushing its own limited asian regional trade pact that excludes washington for the past five years. japan and australia, washington’s closest allies in asia, pledged after trump’s announcement to push ahead without the united states, although removing the largest market for goods and services would shrink it dramatically. “pushing them forward is the idea that, if they don’t act, it will look like china’s very weak trade deals are the only game in town,” said derek scissors, a resident scholar at the american enterprise institute, where he focuses on asian economies and trade. trump has pledged to redraw trade deals to win back american jobs, and has threatened mexico and china with punitive tariffs in a move that some economists have warned could spark a trade war that threatens to roll back decades of liberalization. ending the tpp was a key election pledge of trump’s and was also the policy of his democratic opponent, hillary clinton. the deal died in congress after trump’s nov. 8 election victory. the trans pacific partnership, a signature diplomatic initiative of democratic president barack obama, was intended to lower tariff barriers in countries that accounted for 40 percent of the world economy, as well as providing a bulwark against china. a major trade deal between the united states and europe is also now close to collapse after britain’s plans to withdraw from the european union prompted washington to demand better terms and opposition in france and germany has also all but scuppered it. japanese prime minister shinzo abe said “the tpp would be meaningless without the united states,” even as parliament continued debating ratification and his government vowed to lobby other members to approve it.  “it (the pact) just continues in a state of not being in effect,” said shinpei sasaki of the cabinet office’s tpp headquarters. australian trade minister steven ciobo told reporters in canberra that countries could push ahead with the tpp without the united states by amending the agreement and possibly adding new members.  “we could look at, for example, if china or indonesia or another country wanted to join, saying, ‘yes, we open the door for them signing up to the agreement as well.’” but singapore prime minister lee hsien loong said reopening negotiations would not be easy. “if you sign a fresh agreement, you have to go through it again. we haven’t crossed that bridge yet. we’ll cross it if and when we come to that.” china has pushed its own regional comprehensive economic partnership (rcep), which notably excludes the united states. it is a more traditional trade agreement, involving cutting tariffs rather than opening up economies and setting labor and environmental standards as tpp would. the rcep was a focus of attention at the asia pacific economic cooperation summit in peru over the weekend. tan jian, a senior member of china’s delegation at the summit, said more countries are now seeking to join its 16 member bloc, including peru and chile, and current members want to reach a deal as soon as possible to counter rising protectionism. china’s foreign ministry said on tuesday that beijing has an “open attitude” toward any arrangements that promote free trade in the region as long they don’t become “fragmented and  politicized.” foreign ministry spokesman geng shuang said the rcep was an initiative led by the 10 member association of southeast asian nations (asean), which china has been promoting. “we are willing to keep pushing the (rcep) talks process with all sides to achieve positive progress at an early date,” he said.  vietnam last week shelved its own ratification of tpp, after obama abandoned efforts to push it through a lame duck congress, while malaysia has shifted its attention to the rcep. at a u.s. china agricultural trade seminar in washington, senior obama administration officials and their chinese counterparts appeared to ignore the elephant in the room: the collapse of tpp and trump’s tough trade talk against china. u.s. agriculture secretary tom vilsack said he was focused in a u.s. china trade negotiators meeting in washington this week on reducing china’s regulatory and food safety barriers to american beef, poultry and genetically modified crops out of china. “there hasn’t been a discussion about the future, there’s really a focus on the present,” vilsack said when asked about what he was telling his chinese counterparts about the risks posed by an incoming trump administration. chinese vice premier wang yang did not address trump’s trade rhetoric at the discussion in washington, but warned that a closing of agricultural trade would be “unacceptable to our farmers.” “china is one of the most important markets for agricultural exports, accounting for nearly a fifth of u.s. agricultural exports. ... on average, every u.s. farmer exports about $12,000 of agricultural products to china” every year, wang said.

" president donald trump on friday fired his chief strategist steve bannon in the latest white house shake up, removing a far right architect of his 2016 election victory and a driving force behind his nationalist and anti globalization agenda. bannon’s firing, a year and a day after trump hired him as his campaign chief, put an abrupt end to the rabble rousing political provocateur’s tumultuous tenure in a white house riven with rivalries and back stabbing during which he clashed with more moderate factions. he was instrumental in some of trump’s most contentious policy moves including the ban on people from several muslim majority countries, abandoning the paris climate accord, tearing up international trade agreements and cracking down on illegal immigration. he was no friend of the republican political establishment and was loathed by liberals but was a darling of some of the president’s hard line conservative supporters. white house officials said trump had told new chief of staff john kelly to crack down on the bickering and infighting, and that bannon’s fate was sealed by comments published on  wednesday in the american prospect liberal magazine in which he spoke of targeting his adversaries within the administration. trump, seven months into his presidency, has become increasingly isolated over his comments following white supremacist violence in the virginia college town of charlottesville last saturday and his attacks on fellow republicans. some republicans had even begun questioning trump’s capacity to govern. as trump came under fire from republicans including two former presidents, and from business leaders and u.s. allies abroad, he faced mounting calls for bannon’s ouster. critics had accused bannon of harboring anti semitic and white nationalist sentiments. “white house chief of staff john kelly and steve bannon have mutually agreed today would be steve’s last day,” white house spokeswoman sarah sanders said in a statement. bannon returned to his post as executive chairman of right wing breitbart news on friday afternoon, the website said. prior to joining the trump campaign, he had spearheaded breitbart’s shift into a forum for the “alt right,” a loose online confederation of neo nazis, white supremacists and anti semites. bannon said his departure from the white house signals a major shift for the trump agenda. “the trump presidency that we fought for, and won, is over,” bannon told the conservative weekly standard.  “i just think his ability to get anything done   particularly the bigger things, like the wall, the bigger, broader things that we fought for, it’s just gonna be that much harder,” bannon said. he said he would use breitbart to attack opponents of the  populist and nationalist agenda he championed, including establishment republicans. “i am definitely going to crush the opposition,” bannon said. he became the latest key figure to abruptly depart a trump white house that has been chaotic from its first days and already has lost a chief of staff, a national security adviser, two communications directors and a chief spokesman. trump’s presidency also has been dogged by ongoing investigations in congress and a special counsel named by the justice department into potential collusion between his presidential campaign and russia, something both trump and moscow deny. bannon, 63, is a former u.s. navy officer, goldman sachs investment banker and hollywood movie producer. he had been in a precarious position before but trump opted to keep him, in part because he had played a major role in trump’s november 2016 election victory over democrat hillary clinton and was backed by many of the president’s most loyal rank and file supporters. democrats cheered bannon’s departure. “steve bannon’s firing is welcome news,” said nancy pelosi, the top house of representatives democrat. “the trump administration must not only purge itself of the remaining white supremacists on staff, but abandon the bigoted ideology that clearly governs its decisions.” wall street indexes and the u.s. dollar ended a volatile session lower after a week of drama in washington intensified doubts about trump’s ability to deliver on policy objectives such as tax cuts. after a late morning boost following reports of bannon’s ouster, the dollar and u.s. equities lost ground. bannon felt a close ideological connection to trump’s populist tendencies and “america first” message. like trump, he has also expressed deep skepticism concerning ongoing american military involvement in iraq and afghanistan. the decision to fire bannon could undermine trump’s support among far right voters but might ease tensions within the white house and with party leaders. republicans control the white house and both chambers of congress but have been unable to pass major legislative goals including a healthcare overhaul. trump ran into trouble after saying anti racism demonstrators in charlottesville were as responsible for the violence as the neo nazis and white supremacists who instigated the protests, and that there were “very fine people” among both groups. those remarks sparked rebukes from fellow republicans, top corporate executives and some close allies. bannon’s departure removes a large source of friction on the white house staff, but does not herald a significant shift by trump toward the center on major policy issues, three administration officials said. “a good deal of what was attributed to bannon, for example on china trade and restricting immigration, and the border wall, all came before bannon joined the campaign and would have happened without him,” said one white house official, speaking on the condition of anonymity. bannon has been a hawk on china, urging a tougher line on trade to correct a huge trade imbalance and dismissive of recent efforts to try to elicit beijing’s help to rein in north korea. in his comments to american prospect, bannon said the united states was in an economic war with china.     a second official said the biggest winners from bannon’s departure are national security adviser h.r. mcmaster; gary cohn, trump’s chief economic adviser; and trump’s daughter ivanka and her husband, jared kushner. bannon’s departure cast a cloud over the future of the group of allies he had brought into the white house, such as sebastian gorka. some conservative activists expressed disappointment in bannon’s ouster. republicans were largely quiet, though moderate republican congresswoman ileana ros lehtinen said she was glad bannon was out but that the administration “must work to build bridges, not destroy them.” by the time trump had hired bannon as campaign manager, the real estate magnate had already vanquished his republican opponents for the party’s presidential nomination. asked about bannon on tuesday, trump called him “a friend of mine” but downplayed his contribution to his election victory. “mr. bannon came on very late. you know that. i went through 17 senators, governors and i won all the primaries. mr. bannon came on very much later than that. and i like him. he is a good man. he is not a racist,” trump said.

" president elect donald trump is receiving an average of one presidential intelligence briefing a week, according to u.s. officials familiar with the matter, far fewer than most of his recent predecessors. although they are not required to, presidents elect have in the past generally welcomed the opportunity to receive the president’s daily brief (pdb), the most highly classified and closely held document in the government, on a regular basis. it was not immediately clear why trump has decided not to receive the intelligence briefings available to president barack obama more frequently, or whether that has made any difference in his presidential preparations.  an official on the transition team said on thursday that trump has been receiving national security briefings, including “routine” pdbs and other special briefings, but declined to specify their content or frequency, saying these matters were classified. trump has asked for at least one briefing, and possibly more, from intelligence agencies on specific subjects, one of the officials said. the source declined to identify what subjects interested the president elect, but said that so far they have not included russia or iran. indiana governor mike pence, trump’s vice president elect, has been receiving his own pdb at least six days a week, the sources familiar with the matter said. former central intelligence agency briefer david priess, the author of a book about pdbs, said that traditionally, trump and pence’s predecessors sat for “daily or near daily intelligence briefings” between their elections and their inaugurations. he said jimmy carter and ronald reagan did not start receiving their daily briefings until later in november, while the delayed election result in 2000 meant that george w. bush did not start receiving his until december.  the briefings are not compulsory. priess said that after his first election, richard nixon spurned face to face briefings, so paper pdbs were delivered to his office, only for a “stack” of them to be later returned to the cia, unopened. trump’s casual attitude to the briefings attracted criticism from representative adam schiff, the top democrat on the house intelligence committee. “it is deeply disturbing that the president elect has time for rallies but not for regular intelligence briefings,” schiff said.  during the run up to the nov. 8 presidential election, trump and a handful of advisers received at least two briefings from intelligence officials about broad national security issues. however, the pre election briefings did not include the kind of secrets that are included in the pdbs that obama, trump and pence now have access to. such secrets include information about u.s. espionage sources and covert operations overseas. pdbs are presented to presidents and their closest aides by representatives of the office of the director of national intelligence (odni), though material in them is prepared by the cia, the national security agency, the defense intelligence agency and other parts of the u.s. intelligence community, the officials said. during and after the election campaign, trump raised questions about the intelligence on hacking of u.s. political institutions. in a statement on oct. 7, odni and the department of homeland security expressed confidence that the russian government had “directed” hacking into “emails from u.s. persons and institutions” that was “intended to interfere with the u.s. election process.” trump, however, has repeatedly dismissed suggestions that russia was behind the efforts, telling time magazine earlier this week: “i don’t believe they interfered ... it could be russia. it could be china. and it could be some guy in his home in new jersey.” (corrects to say iran, not france, in fifth paragraph) ",0
" two u.s. senators on wednesday issued a formal draft of a controversial bill that would give courts the power to order technology companies like apple to help authorities break into encrypted devices or communications for law enforcement or intelligence purposes. the proposal arrives just days after an earlier draft leaked online and drew fire from security researchers and civil liberties advocates who warned it would undermine internet security and expose personal data to hackers. those same groups on wednesday said the new draft is little different from the leaked version. the bill comes as the u.s. justice department has redoubled its efforts to use the courts to force apple (aapl.o) to unlock encrypted iphones. senators richard burr and dianne feinstein, the senate intelligence committee’s republican chair and top democrat, said in a statement they intended now to “solicit input from the public and key stakeholders before formally introducing the bill.” “i am hopeful that this draft will start a meaningful and inclusive debate on the role of encryption and its place within the rule of law,” burr said. “based on initial feedback, i am confident that the discussion has begun.” the new discussion draft does not require manufacturers or communications companies to process, transmit or store data in any particular format.  rather, it requires companies, upon receipt of a court order, to turn over to the government “data in an intelligible format” even if encryption has rendered that data inaccessible to anyone other than the owner. companies must ensure their products “be capable of complying,” the bill states. critics say that amounts to a ban on strong encryption. the latest version of the bill narrows the scope of cases where a court can issue an order. those include crimes that caused or could cause death or serious injury or that involve drug offenses or child victims, in addition to foreign intelligence operations, according to the text. andrew crocker, staff attorney at the electronic frontier foundation, a digital rights group, said changes in the new discussion draft were minimal and the bill still threatened internet security because companies would only be able to comply by weakening encryption in all their products. the proposed legislation, which is expected to continue facing strong opposition from the technology sector and privacy advocates, faces an uphill battle in a gridlocked congress. “this flawed bill would leave americans more vulnerable to stalkers, identity thieves, foreign hackers and criminals,” said democratic senator ron wyden in a statement.

" germany has tightened security at christmas markets across the country a year after a deadly truck attack on a berlin christmas market, with conservative chancellor angela merkel under fire from victims  relatives for her handling of the case. anis amri, a failed tunisian asylum seeker with islamist links, hijacked a truck on dec. 19, killed the driver and then plowed it into a crowded berlin christmas market, killing 11 more people and injuring dozens of others. about 2,600 christmas markets reopened in late november with added security staff on patrol and concrete barriers to protect shoppers.  merkel this week paid a surprise visit to the site of the attack, where a permanent memorial for victims will be unveiled on tuesday. she will meet on monday with relatives of victims, many of whom say they felt neglected by the government after the attack.  in an open letter to merkel published in der spiegel magazine this month, victims and survivors complained that the chancellor had not met with them personally. kurt beck, a social democratic politician who is representing victims and survivors, told reporters merkel s handling of the tragedy stood in contrast with how the french government had responded to terrorist attacks in paris. he also blasted what he called an  unbelievable  case in which the family of one victim was sent a bill for an autopsy and then hounded by bill collectors.  there are incidents which must not be repeated,  beck said, urging the government to increase hardship compensation for the victims  relatives and the survivors. german officials say they have tightened security and increased information sharing among security forces after investigations exposed a range of failures in the amri case. but experts say much work remains to be done.   cooperation between intelligence agencies and between police authorities must be improved,  said malte roschniski, a berlin security expert.

" donald trump rode to the top of the republican ticket promising a “big, beautiful, powerful” border wall with mexico to stop the flow of undocumented immigrants. along that border, however, americans are more likely to call the wall a “waste of money”, according to a reuters/ipsos opinion poll. the results show that while the new york businessman may have expected his tough stance on immigration to fire up support nationally, it seems to be falling short in a state heavily affected by illegal immigration, and where he is now facing a surprising challenge from his democratic rival hillary clinton. asked if a wall would be “an effective barrier or a waste of money,” 47 percent of arizona residents picked “waste of money” and 34 percent picked “effective barrier”, with the rest picking neither, according to the poll. among republicans, 21 percent picked “waste of money” and 57 percent picked “effective barrier.” most arizonans also believed it is not realistic to expect mexico to pay for the wall, something trump has vowed would happen if he’s elected president on nov. 8, according to the poll. the results lined up closely with nationwide opinions of trump’s immigration policy: 49 percent of american adults say the wall would be a “waste of money” and 31 percent say it would be an “effective barrier.” “as big and powerful, as rich as this nation is, we cannot just leave the door open,” said tony estrada, santa cruz county sheriff, who has served in law enforcement in the border county for 49 years. “but, we need a realistic and humane process. donald trump is … catering to people’s fear.” polls show arizona, a state that has voted democrat only once in a presidential election since 1952, has become competitive. the real clear politics average of polls showed clinton ahead there by 1.3 percentage points. reuters/ipsos polling shows trump ahead there by 4 points.  clinton’s campaign said last week it would spend $2 million more campaigning in arizona before the election. arizona’s border with mexico is 370 miles long, covering an isolated desert terrain that has drawn millions seeking to cross illegally. the state’s number of undocumented immigrants has fallen 35 percent from a 2007 peak to 325,000, according to the pew research center, as arizona cracked down on that population. nationwide, the number has dropped 9 percent from a high in 2007 to 11.1 million undocumented immigrants. wendy cornacchio, a 45 year old trump supporter from phoenix, said she believes illegal immigration is still a problem – but she would rather see technologies like drone surveillance than trump’s wall to address it.  “i don’t think that necessarily building a wall will work, but the concept of closing the borders i agree with,” she said. florida is another closely fought state that has seen large levels of illegal immigration, though by sea rather than by land. some 41 percent of voters there said they believed trump’s wall would be a “waste of money”, while 36 percent thought it would be an “effective barrier”. progressive activist groups in both florida and arizona have been using trump’s hard line on immigration against him to mobilize latinos for clinton, who advocates a path to citizenship for some undocumented immigrants. mi familia vota, for example, says they registered more than 15,000 people in arizona this year. the reuters/ipsos poll was conducted online in english and spanish in arizona and florida. the arizona poll ran from oct. 5 to oct. 19 and gathered responses from 2,600 people. the florida poll ran from oct. 5 to oct. 12 and gathered responses from 2,610 people. both polls have a credibility interval, a measure of accuracy, of 2 percentage points for the total group and 3 percentage points for likely voters.

" u.s. president donald trump’s administration reversed a decision late on thursday and said fiancés would be considered close family members and therefore allowed to travel to the united states as its revised travel ban took effect. the u.s. state department concluded “upon further review,  fiancés would now be included as close family members,” said a state department official who requested anonymity. the trump administration had previously decided, on the basis of its interpretation of a u.s. supreme court ruling, that grandparents, grandchildren and fiancés traveling from iran, libya, somalia, sudan, syria and yemen would be barred from obtaining visas while the ban was in place. the 90 day ban took effect at 8 p.m. edt (0000 gmt friday), along with a 120 day ban on all refugees.  on monday, the supreme court revived parts of trump’s travel ban on people from the six muslim majority countries, narrowing the scope of lower court rulings that had blocked parts of a march 6 executive order and allowing his temporary ban to go into effect for people with no strong ties to the united states. a spokesman for the department of homeland security, who also requested anonymity, said it would be updating its guidance to state that fiancés would not be barred from obtaining visas while the ban was in place. the supreme court exempted from the ban travelers and refugees with a “bona fide relationship” with a person or entity in the united states. as an example, the court said those with a “close familial relationship” with someone in the united states would be covered.  the state of hawaii asked a federal judge in honolulu on thursday evening to determine whether the trump administration had interpreted the court’s decision too narrowly. hawaii said in a court filing that the u.s. government intended to violate the supreme court’s instructions by improperly excluding from the united states people who actually have a close family relationship to u.s. persons, echoing criticism from immigrant and refugee groups.  hawaii called the refusal to recognize grandparents and other relatives as an acceptable family relationship “a plain violation of the supreme court’s command.”  hawaii’s attorney general doug chin asked u.s. district judge derrick watson in honolulu, who blocked trump’s travel ban in march, to issue an order “as soon as possible” clarifying how the supreme court’s ruling should be interpreted. watson ordered the justice department to respond to hawaii’s request by monday, and said he would allow hawaii to reply by july 6. a senior u.s. official did not answer directly when asked how barring grandparents or grandchildren would make the united states safer, but instead pointed to trump’s guidance to pause “certain travel while we review our security posture.” the u.s. government expected “things to run smoothly” and “business as usual” at u.s. ports of entry, another senior u.s. official told reporters. a handful of immigration lawyers gathered at dulles international airport outside washington on thursday in case of any problems. “we’re going to keep fighting this ban, even if it applies very narrowly,” said sirine shebaya, a senior staff attorney at muslim advocates. “it’s still a muslim ban, and its still trying to send a message to a whole community that they’re not welcome here.” the administration said refugees who have agreements with resettlement agencies but not close family in the united states would not be exempted from the ban, likely sharply limiting the number of refugees allowed entry in coming months. hawaii said in its court filing it was “preposterous” not to consider a formal link with a resettlement agency a qualifying relationship. refugee resettlement agencies had expected that their formal links with would be refugees would qualify as “bona fide.”  the administration’s decision likely means that few refugees beyond a 50,000 cap set by trump would be allowed into the country this year. a u.s. official said that, as of wednesday evening, 49,009 refugees had been allowed into the country this fiscal year. the state department said refugees scheduled to arrive through july 6 could still enter. trump first announced a temporary travel ban on jan. 27, calling it a counterterrorism measure to allow time to develop  better security vetting. the order caused chaos at airports, as officials scrambled to enforce it before it was blocked by courts. opponents argued that the measure discriminated against muslims and that there was no security rationale for it. a revised version of the ban was also halted by courts. the state department guidance, distributed to all u.s. diplomatic posts on wednesday evening and seen by reuters, fleshed out the supreme court’s ruling about people who have a “bona fide” relationship with an individual or entity in the united states. it defined a close familial relationship as being a parent, spouse, child, adult son or daughter, son in law, daughter in law or sibling, including step siblings and other step family relations. a department cable said grandparents, grandchildren, aunts, uncles, nieces, nephews, cousins, brothers in law and sisters in law, fiancés, “and any other ‘extended’ family members” were not considered close family. the guidelines also said workers with offers of employment from a

" a divided u.s. supreme court struggled on wednesday with how to resolve a dispute over whether immigrants detained by the u.s. government for more than six months while deportation proceedings take place should be able to seek their release. the case takes on additional importance with the expectation that president elect donald trump will ramp up immigration enforcement, placing more people in detention awaiting deportation, when he takes office on jan. 20, as he pledged during his election campaign. during a one hour argument, the court’s four liberals appeared to support requiring that immigrants held more than six months be automatically eligible for hearings in which they could argue for their freedom while their deportation cases unfold. conservative justices were skeptical. the shorthanded court could be heading toward another 4 4 deadlock, divided along ideological lines. a 4 4 split would leave in place an october 2015 ruling by the san francisco based 9th u.s. circuit court of appeals that upheld a lower court injunction requiring a hearing after six months of detention. the justices potentially could issue a narrow decision sending the case back to lower courts without resolving the question of whether hearings are required. the obama administration, which asked the justices to decide the case, has said hearings can be permitted in certain instances but opposed a blanket rule requiring them. the long running class action litigation brought by the american civil liberties union includes some immigrants who were held at the border when seeking illegal entry into the united states and others, including legal permanent residents, who have been convicted of crimes. the case also could affect long term u.s. residents who entered the country illegally. liberal justices asserted that hearings should be required in order to meet the u.s. constitution’s promise of due process. “you can’t just lock people up without any finding of dangerousness, without any finding of flight risk, for an indefinite period of time, and not run into due process,” said justice elena kagan “we are in an upended world if we think 14 months or 19 months is a reasonable time to detain a person,” added justice sonia sotomayor. conservatives including chief justice john roberts said the court had been asked to decide only whether the immigration laws in question required the hearings and not whether there was a potential constitutional violation. the case would have to be litigated further in lower courts for that issue to reach the justices, roberts said. the lead plaintiff is alejandro rodriguez, a legal immigrant from mexico who was working as a dental assistant when he was detained for three years without a hearing. rodriguez was placed in removal proceedings based on prior convictions for drug possession and joyriding. although he was released eventually, the case brought on his behalf continued.

" the trump administration will not issue executive orders calling for a review of international treaties and u.s. funding of the united nations and other international bodies “at this time,” a senior u.s. administration official said on friday. the trump administration was preparing executive orders that would review u.s. funding of the united nations and other international organizations and certain forms of multilateral treaties, the new york times reported on wednesday. “we remain committed to supporting the useful and necessary work performed by such organizations and alliances, and look forward to continuing that support,” the official told reuters, speaking on condition of anonymity. “while no executive orders on these subjects are expected at this time, this president and his administration intend to be watchful stewards of the american people’s interests and of the american taxpayer’s dollars,” the official added. it was immediately clear why the orders were being shelved. according to one draft executive order published by the daily beast, trump wants a committee, including his secretary of state, attorney general and director of national intelligence, to carry out a one year review of u.s. funding to international organizations with the aim of almost halving voluntary funding. the united states is the largest contributor to the united nations, paying 22 percent of the $5.4 billion core u.n. budget and 28 percent of the $7.9 billion u.n. peacekeeping budget. these are assessed contributions   agreed by the u.n. general assembly   and not voluntary payments. u.n. agencies, such as the u.n. development programme, the children’s agency unicef, the world food programme and the u.n. population fund, are funded voluntarily. the new u.s. ambassador to the un, nikki haley, pledged on friday to overhaul the world body and warned u.s. allies that if they did not support washington then she is “taking names” and will respond. during her senate foreign relations committee confirmation hearing this month, haley said she did not back “slashing” u.n. funding.

" images released by north korea on thursday appeared to show it has succeeded in developing a missile capable of delivering a nuclear weapon anywhere in the united states and it could be only two or three tests away from being declared combat ready, u.s. based experts said on thursday.    north korea released dozens of photos and a video after wednesday s launch of the new hwasong 15 missile, and leader kim jong un declared the country had  finally realized the great historic cause of completing the state nuclear force . u.s. based experts, some of whom have been skeptical about past north korean claims to have put all of the united states in range, said data from the latest test and the photos appeared to confirm north korea has a missile of sufficient power to deliver a nuclear warhead anywhere in america. experts and u.s. officials say questions remain about  whether it has a re entry vehicle capable of protecting a nuclear warhead as it speeds toward its target and about the accuracy of its guidance systems. in an analysis for the washington based 38 north think tank, missile expert michael elleman of the international institute for strategic studies said the north korean photos showed a missile considerably larger than its predecessor.  initial calculations indicate the new missile could deliver a moderately sized nuclear weapon to any city on the u.s. mainland,  elleman said. elleman said the missile was large and powerful enough to carry simple decoys or other countermeasures to challenge u.s. missile defenses.  a handful of additional flight tests are needed to validate the hwasong 15 s performance and reliability, and likely establish the efficacy of a protection system needed to ensure the warhead survives the rigors of atmospheric re entry,  elleman wrote. only two or three more tests might be needed if north korea could accept low confidence in the missile s reliability. another missile expert, whose employer does not allow him to speak publicly to the media, agreed with elleman s assessment.  if north korea does not make high demands on the reliability or accuracy of the missile ... two or three more tests would suffice.  so long as north korea can hit u.s. cities with thermonuclear warheads, they probably don t need the ability hit every city they target or target specific aim points within those cities to convince the u.s. leadership that war with north korea would be too expensive to contemplate.  in a call with u.s. president donald trump on thursday, south korean president moon jae in said the missile was north korea s most advanced so far. but it was unclear if pyongyang had the technology to miniaturize a nuclear warhead, and it still needed to prove other things, including re entry technology. u.s. based experts said north korea had almost certainly developed a warhead light enough to be carried by the hwasong  15, which elleman said should be capable of delivering a 1,000 kg payload. jeffrey lewis of the middlebury institute of strategic studies said on twitter the hwasong 15 was  so big that the warhead wouldn t need to be miniaturized.  on wednesday, u.s. defense secretary jim mattis acknowledged  the missile went higher than any previous test and was part of a north korean effort  to continue building ballistic missiles that can threaten everywhere in the world, basically.   north korea said the missile soared to an altitude of about 4,475 km (2,780 miles), more than 10 times the height of the international space station, and flew 950 km (590 miles) during its 53 minute flight before landing in the sea near japan. the missile s large size was immediately apparent in the photos, which analysts said allowed for a more powerful propulsion system.  this is a very big missile,  said michael duitsman, a research associate at the centre for nonproliferation studies.  and i don t mean  big for north korea.  only a few countries can produce missiles of this size, and north korea just joined the club.  u.s. experts and officials said the missile still appeared to be powered by liquid fuel, something that made it vulnerable as it could take to up to two hours to fuel on site before launching.  earlier, one u.s. official told reuters the missile could have been powered by solid fuel, but experts said north korea could still be a few years away from being able to field a more versatile solid fueled icbm.   the photos appeared to show the missile with at least two large nozzles on its first stage, instead of the one large and several smaller nozzles on the hwasong 14.  the first stage seems to use essentially the same case (as the hwasong 14) but has two engines,  said david wright, of the union of concerned scientists, a u.s. based nonprofit science advocacy group.  the second stage looks like it can carry more than twice as much propellant. the combination of those two things means it really is a new, more capable missile.  while the photos show a mobile erector vehicle being used to position the missile upright, it is not seen in photos of the launch itself. u.s. intelligence analysts have concluded that the test missile was fired from a fixed position, not a mobile launcher, three u.s. officials said. the massive vehicle was  100 percent  a domestic product of north korea, state media quoted kim jong un as saying. western analysts said it is more likely the truck was one of about half a dozen vehicles obtained years ago from china, which north korea has modified since then.

" the united states criticized a decision by poland s media regulator to slap a $415,000 fine on tvn, a u.s. owned private broadcaster, saying the ruling appeared to undermine media freedom. the broadcaster was fined by regulator krrit on monday over its coverage of protests in parliament last year.  this decision appears to undermine media freedom in poland, a close ally and fellow democracy. free and independent media are essential to a strong democracy,  the u.s. department of state said in a statement on tuesday. it added that it remained confident in the ability of polish authorities to ensure democratic institutions were fully functioning and respected. the regulator said it had fined the broadcaster s tvn24 channel for  promoting illegal activities and encouraging behavior that threatens security,  without giving details. tvn24 is the most widely watched independent channel in poland, and critics on monday interpreted the fine as an effort to mute its criticism of the ruling law and justice (pis) party amid speculation the state may take the broadcaster over.  since taking office in late 2015, the pis has been at loggerheads with the european union over policy, including placing the country s media under increased state control.

" the head of a private investment firm came one step closer to leading the federal reserve’s regulatory efforts wednesday, a key post as president donald trump endeavors to trim regulations to boost economic growth. the u.s. senate voted 62 33 to limit debate on randal quarles’ nomination to join the fed’s board of governors, guaranteeing opponents could not delay his confirmation. quarles is eventually expected to fill the role of vice chair for supervision at the fed, making him the top official at the central bank in charge of regulatory issues.     the senate will vote to name quarles formally to that post at a later date, after he has joined the fed board. quarles is a prominent investor and former treasury department official. trump nominated him in july.     analysts said the appointment of quarles and the october departure of federal reserve vice chair stanley fischer, who had spoken out against weakening wall street regulations, could accelerate trump’s deregulation agenda, potentially saving banks such as goldman sachs group inc (gs.n), jpmorgan chase & co (jpm.n) and morgan stanley (ms.n) billions of dollars.

" donald trump directly asked russian president vladimir putin during their talks at a weekend summit in vietnam whether allegations of russian meddling in last year s u.s. presidential election were true, ria news agency reported on sunday. the u.s. president said on saturday he believed putin s denial of the accusations despite the view of u.s. intelligence agencies that russian interference did take place. trump later distanced himself from his remarks. according to ria, kremlin spokesman dmitry peskov, asked how trump had raised the question about alleged russian meddling, said:  in fact, trump asked whether that information could be true, how true it could be, and president putin, for his part, explained his position, which is that russia did not interfere in any election and this could not be the case.  putin also said he did not understand  the groundless statements on the issue being made in the united states , peskov added. the russian issue has clouded trump s first year in office. trump s initial comments on saturday drew criticism at home because u.s. intelligence agencies have long since concluded there was russian meddling through hacking and the release of emails to embarrass democratic candidate hillary clinton. on sunday, trump was careful to make clear he sided with the intelligence agencies under his own leadership. he has previously called the allegations of election campaign collusion with moscow a hoax.

" president nicolas maduro defended venezuela’s “secure” election system on tuesday as opponents struggled to present a united front over allegations of fraud in a nationwide vote surprisingly won by the ruling socialists.  despite widespread anger over economic hardship, the socialist party confounded opinion polls to take 17 of 23 governorships in sunday’s election.  stunned by the defeat that undermines their aim to win the presidency in 2018, the opposition democratic unity coalition refused to acknowledge the results and called the election rigged, as did the united states. though the coalition has complained of an unfair playing field   from abuse of state resources to last minute moving of vote centers away from opposition strongholds   it has not given detailed evidence of ballot tampering. some opposition figures have acknowledged abstention by their supporters   disillusioned by the failure of street protests to dislodge maduro earlier this year   was a big factor. two losing opposition candidates, henri falcon in lara state and alejandro feo la cruz in carabobo, have conceded defeat, breaking with the official coalition position. both criticized “irregularities” in the vote but also lamented many demoralized opposition supporters stayed at home. “we need courage to recognize truth in adversity,” said falcon. the strongest criticism of sunday’s vote came from washington, which slammed maduro’s “dictatorship.” several european nations also expressed concern, while 12 countries in the americas from the so called lima group condemned “obstacles, intimidation, manipulation and irregularities”. washington is considering further sanctions on venezuela, after various measures against top officials and the economy earlier this year, while the european union is mulling the same. government leaders have smarted at fraud accusations. “venezuela’s election system is the most secure and audited in the world,” maduro said on tuesday. “president donald trump, i am not a dictator; i am a humble worker ... i have a moustache and look like stalin, but i’m not him.” the venezuelan leader invited eu foreign policy chief federica mogherini to visit or receive him in brussels to “open their eyes,” and told “stupid” canada to stop meddling. foreign minister jorge arreaza later said on twitter that maduro had recalled venezuela’s ambassador to canada for talks. heaping further humiliation on venezuela’s opposition, the governors were due to be sworn in on tuesday by a new legislative superbody elected controversially in july. the opposition boycotted that vote and has refused to recognize the entirely pro government constituent assembly, which supersedes all institutions including the opposition controlled congress. the opposition’s five governors elect planned to boycott the swearing in ceremony, defying maduro’s threat to bar them from office for failing to accept the assembly as a higher authority. “we will not kneel to anyone,” said juan pablo guanipa, who won the oil rich western zulia state.  despite food shortages, runaway inflation and a tanking currency, venezuela’s government retains significant bastions of support, especially in poorer, rural parts of the country. in his news conference, maduro said the socialists also won bolivar state, which would take its total to 18 governorships versus five for the opposition.  the government won a total of 54 percent of the votes overall, he added. the election board has not confirmed the bolivar result or the overall vote figures. with the opposition coalition’s dozens of parties arguing over whether there was fraud, what went wrong, and where to go next, it will need to regroup and map strategy quickly heading into the 2018 presidential campaign. its very future may even be in doubt, since many young activists who took to the streets for four straight months of protests and pitched battles with security forces earlier this year feel betrayed by their leaders. the unrest killed at least 125 people. maduro has long accused opposition leaders of being behind violence, and on tuesday called the new opposition governor of zulia state a “fascist” while accusing his counterpart in tachira of links to colombian “paramilitaries.” the election aftermath appears to have sunk a government opposition mediation effort that began last month in the dominican republic. even though maduro wants to resuscitate the talks, the opposition coalition has ruled that out. “we are the majority, the dictatorship is more and more illegitimate, popular and global condemnation grows daily against this regime,” it said in a communique late on monday.

"salem, n.c. (reuters)   minority voters in north carolina will have a harder time casting a ballot this presidential election year if a judge allows a law requiring photo identification at the polls to take effect, challengers of the law said in federal court on monday. but a lawyer representing the state said only a small number of people may not have the necessary forms of identification and exceptions will be allowed under an amended version of the measure. “it’s a policy question,” lawyer thomas farr said. “the evidence here does not rise anywhere close to showing a discriminatory intent.” the trial in winston salem is one of several closely watched voting rights battles that will play out across the country as democrats and republicans fight for the white house in november.  democrats argue voter id laws passed by republican led state legislatures target voters who typically support the democratic party. proponents of the measures say they are intended to prevent voter fraud. the case in north carolina tests a key piece of broad voting restrictions passed soon after the u.s. supreme court ruled in 2013 that states with a history of discrimination no longer needed federal approval for voting law changes affecting minorities. the u.s. justice department and national association for the advancement of colored people argue north carolina’s revised voting protocol disproportionately burdens african americans and hispanics, who are more likely than whites to lack the acceptable forms of identification. the law “threatens to deter, confuse and disenfranchise voters,” said michael glick, a lawyer representing the naacp. “it sets out to solve a problem that never existed.” last summer, u.s. district judge thomas schroeder heard arguments about the state’s decision to shorten its early voting period, end same day registration, eliminate pre registration for 16  and 17 year olds and stop provisional ballots cast outside the correct precinct from being counted. he has not issued a decision. the voter id requirement is getting a separate vetting after lawmakers amended it in 2015 ahead of the initial trial. now voters who cite a “reasonable impediment” to being able to obtain acceptable identification will be allowed to cast a provisional ballot. south carolina is the only other state with a reasonable impediment provision, farr said. challengers said the law remains discriminatory and could give election workers too much discretion. it is unknown if schroeder will rule before the state’s presidential primaries in march.

" u.s. democratic presidential candidate hillary clinton on tuesday expanded her plan to tax the wealthiest americans by saying she would close tax avoidance “loopholes” that allow investments to be routed through low tax countries and put in tax deferred retirement accounts. “my plan is kind of simple: we go after the wealthy to pay for what the middle class working people and poor people need,” clinton said at a campaign stop in ames, iowa on tuesday.  “i think that’s a smart way to help fund some of our priorities,” clinton added. clinton said she would end the “bermuda reinsurance loophole” that allows hedge fund managers to route investments through an insurance company in a low tax country such as bermuda to avoid paying a higher tax rate.  clinton also said she would close what she calls the “romney loophole,” which allows wealthy individuals to shield large sums of money in individual retirement accounts from taxation. her proposals come after a plan announced monday to add a 4.0 percent income tax surcharge on earners of more than $5 million per year.  clinton has reiterated her support for the buffett rule, named after billionaire investor and clinton endorser warren buffett, which would institute a minimum tax rate of 30 percent on those earning more than $1 million per year.  clinton, long the democratic party’s front runner for the nomination, is unveiling her plan to tax the wealthy amid slipping poll numbers in the key early voting states of iowa and new hampshire as her chief rival, u.s. senator bernie sanders from vermont, has wooed supporters with his plan to address income inequality. on tuesday, a quinnipiac poll saw sanders win a five point lead over clinton among likely iowa caucus goers.  in new hampshire, sanders outpaced the former secretary of state by 14 points, securing 53 percent of the party’s support, a monmouth university survey said. the polls had an error margin of 4.4 and 4.8 points, respectively. iowa voters will kick off the nation’s nominating race with caucuses held on feb. 1, and new hampshire voters will cast ballots in the first in the nation primaries on feb. 9.

" united nations political affairs chief jeffrey feltman arrived in north korea on tuesday for a rare visit that some analysts and diplomats hope could spark a u.n. led effort to defuse rising tensions over pyongyang s nuclear and missile programs. the former senior u.s. state department official is the highest level u.n. official to visit north korea since 2011. during a four day visit he is due to meet foreign minister ri yong ho to discuss  issues of mutual interest and concern.   this is broadly a policy dialogue with (north korea). i think we have to wait and see what comes out,  u.n. spokesman stephane dujarric told reporters on tuesday.  all key member states ... were informed and briefed of the visit.   u.n. secretary general antonio guterres told russia, japan, the united states, china and north and south korea in august he was available to help broker talks. so called six party talks on north korea s nuclear program stalled in 2008. a u.n. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, described expectations for feltman s visit as  modest and high at the same time, meaning that they depend on what our hosts are thinking as well.   we need to find a way to scale back tensions,  the official said.  i don t think we will have a major breakthrough being announced at the end of this trip. but the visit could serve as a step to build a framework for engagement.  suzanne dimaggio of the new america foundation think tank, a participant in recent unofficial talks with north korea, said feltman could propose during his visit to pyongyang that guterres play a mediation role.  i do think that the trump administration would like to explore talks about talks at this stage. i think the north koreans are assessing the timing of when to do that,  she told a  seminar in washington on north korea.  state department spokeswoman heather nauert said feltman was not traveling on behalf of the u.s. government.  and he s not traveling   i want to make this clear   with any kind of message from the u.s. government ... he s going on behalf of the u.n., not the u.s. government,  she told a regular news briefing. nauert said washington remained open to talks if north korea showed it was serious about giving up its nuclear weapons, but added:  the activities they have been engaged in recently have shown that they are not interested, they are not serious about sitting down and having conversations.   north korea has been working to develop nuclear tipped missiles capable of reaching the united states in defiance of u.n. sanctions. it conducted its sixth and largest nuclear test in september and last week tested a missile capable of reaching anywhere in america.  feltman told the 15 member security council last week that its unity  creates an opportunity for sustained diplomatic engagement   an opportunity that must be seized in these dangerous times to seek off ramps and work to create conditions for negotiations.  in september, russian u.n. ambassador vassily nebenzia urged a return to dialogue, including  by leveraging mediation efforts  by guterres.  russian deputy foreign minister igor morgulov said on tuesday that pyongyang was seeking dialogue with washington on its nuclear program, according to ria news agency. morgulov, at a conference in berlin, was quoted as saying russia had communication channels with north korea open and was ready to exert its influence on pyongyang. sweden s deputy u.n. ambassador carl skau told reporters he hoped guterres could mediate in  probably the largest threat to international peace and security at the moment.  britain s deputy u.n. ambassador jonathan allen said feltman had  our backing and i think he goes to represent the u.n. family as a whole.

" the incoming dutch government rolled out the red carpet for big business on tuesday, firming up plans to lower the corporate tax rate to 21 percent and scrap a 15 percent tax on dividends. as part of the biggest tax overhaul in years, it also introduced a tax on royalties in a bid to counter a reputation for abetting tax avoidance by housing shell companies that act as a conduit for money destined for tax havens.  i do feel we should be much tougher on mailbox companies ... and we are going to do that,  prime minister mark rutte told a news conference at the parliament building.  at the same time if there are serious companies that want to have their headquarters in the netherlands, we d love to have them,  he said. he said britain s decision to leave the european union gave the netherlands a chance to attract firms based in britain but seeking a european headquarters. the corporate tax rate will be lowered incrementally each year. other proposals are targeted to go into effect by 2019, after approval by parliament. the netherlands is favored by multinationals and is currently battling a fine from the eu for giving starbucks tax advantages that amounted to state aid. google and apple route money there and reinvest it abroad rather than repatriating it to the united states where it would be subject to higher tax rates. the netherlands is also popular with rock stars such as the rolling stones and u2 who until now have benefited from the country s favorable treatment of royalties. tax experts said the package of reforms was a mixed picture.  reducing the corporate tax benefits all businesses and getting rid of dividend withholding is aimed at making the netherlands more interesting for foreign investors,  said rudolph de vries, a tax adviser at ernst & young and professor at leiden university. he said the reduction in corporate taxes will be partially offset by another reform in the works: a move to limit the deductibility of debt. marcel klok, senior economist at ing, said the rules will lead to about 1.3 billion euros in missed tax revenues from  foreign companies, to a large extent due to the abolition of dividend taxes.  he noted the lower corporate tax rate of 21 percent, while a significant cut from 25 percent, is just slightly below the eu average of 21.5 percent.  it seems like the netherlands is shifting towards doing what the oecd and other international partners are asking for, so going in the direction of having less exemptions,  he said.  but because they are reducing some tariffs and other measures the net effect is very beneficial for foreign firms to come and invest here.  alexander pechtold, the leader of one of the junior parties in rutte s new four party coalition, said mailbox companies and others taking advantage of loopholes in the tax code  will be better off elsewhere .  you have these singers who are doing all these fabulous charitable things from the money they are not paying in taxes,  he said.  we will now take care of the charitable causes ourselves directly, without the singers in between.

" scotland’s first minister nicola sturgeon congratulated donald trump on winning the u.s. presidential election on wednesday but said many would feel anxious about his victory. “it is normal in any election for those on the losing side to feel disappointment, but today, many in america and across the world, will also feel a real sense of anxiety,” sturgeon said in statement. trump, whose mother was scottish, owns two golf courses on the west and east coasts of scotland. he has made much of his scottish roots, telling a scottish newspaper earlier this year that just as he had won over scotland, where he faced fierce local resistance to some of his development plans, he would win over the united states. sturgeon has long been vocal on her distaste for trump and endorsed his opponent hillary clinton as recently as tuesday. “while this is not the outcome i hoped for, it is the verdict of the american people and we must respect it. i congratulate president elect trump on winning the election,” she said.

" president donald trump’s former campaign manager paul manafort did not violate a court gag order when he helped edit an opinion piece about his political work in ukraine, his defense lawyer kevin downing argued in a court filing on thursday. a federal grand jury indicted manafort and his business associate rick gates in october as part of special counsel robert mueller’s investigation into accusations of russian meddling in the 2016 u.s. presidential election. the charges against manafort include conspiracy to launder money and failing to register as a foreign agent working on behalf of former pro russian ukrainian president viktor yanukovych’s government, who was ousted in 2014.     thursday’s filing came after prosecutors working for mueller said earlier this week that they no longer could agree to more lenient bail terms for manafort after discovering that he was working with a colleague tied to russian intelligence agencies on an opinion piece that cast his work in a favorable light.     mueller’s office argued that his efforts to work behind the scenes on the piece as recently as november 30 ran afoul of the judge’s november 8 order instructing all parties to refrain from making statements to the media or in public settings that could prejudice the case. jason maloni, a spokesman for manafort, declined to comment.  joshua stueve, a spokesman for mueller, also declined to comment. downing said in thursday’s filing that his client was involved only in editing the piece to ensure accuracy, and that it would not prejudice the case because it was ultimately published in a ukrainian newspaper, not an american one. “the defense did not, and does not, understand that the	 court meant to impose a gag order	 precluding mr. manafort from addressing matters, which do not ‘pose a substantial	 likelihood of	 material prejudice to this case,’” downing wrote. earlier in the week, prosecutors said in a filing that they had reached out to manafort’s lawyers when they discovered the draft and had been assured that it would not be published. the piece appeared online in the english language kyiv post on thursday. the article, which was authored by oleg voloshyn, a former spokesman for ukraine’s foreign affairs ministry, praised   manafort’s political work in helping ukraine secure better relations with the european union. “i can only wonder why some american media dare falsely claim that paul manafort lobbied russian interests in ukraine,” the piece said. “without his input ukraine would not have had the command focus on reforms that were required to be a nation candidate to the eu.”   brian bonner, the chief editor at the kyiv post, told reuters that the article was submitted on monday. bonner said voloshyn claimed to have written the article and then sent it to manafort and the american’s longtime russian colleague, konstantin kilimnik, for fact checking before submission.  bonner said he did not immediately publish the article because he was suspicious of the contents and wanted to confirm that voloshyn had written it.   “it was blatantly pro manafort with an opinion about his activities that most people don’t share and that his record in ukraine doesn’t support,” bonner wrote in an email.  voloshyn told reuters he was not immediately in a position to comment. it was not clear when u.s. district judge amy berman jackson would decide the issue, but manafort and gates are due to appear before her on monday in the u.s. district court for the district of columbia for a status hearing.

" twice a month a few dozen russian orthodox believers gather in a small catholic chapel whose foundations date back to the 11th century, their temporary place of worship as they do not have a church of their own in western hungary. these worshippers now have a good chance of having their own church built in the spa town of heviz, after prime minister viktor orban granted 2.4 billion forints ($9 million) in the budget to the renovating and building of russian orthodox churches. channelling state money to the hungarian branch of the russian church, which had just 2,365 followers in the latest census in the mostly catholic country of 10 million, was seen by political analysts and critics as a bid to win favor with  president vladimir putin.  orban signed off the decree and it was published on feb. 1, the day before he received putin in budapest. it was their fourth meeting in two years and putin was back on aug. 28 for a judo event when they met again. on that day, orban allocated an additional 313 million forints to the russian orthodox church. although the amounts are small, some analysts and critics see the bolstering of the russian orthodox church with state cash as significant in the context of russian hungarian relations.   this move is on the one hand a gesture toward vladimir putin, and the russians, a small community living here in hungary, but at the same time it really shows the ... influence of russia on hungary,  said peter kreko, director of think tank political capital.  hungary s alignment to russia is unsettling to fellow european union member states where russia s alleged interference is taken with such alarm that several countries have moved to set up agencies to counter it.  inside the european union, hungary promotes scrapping economic sanctions imposed after russia s annexation of crimea in 2014, saying it hurts trade.  trade ties between russia and hungary include a gas supply pact with gazprom and a deal for russia to finance and build a nuclear power plant. construction is due to start next year.  in february, orban said hungary wanted  open and transparent  relations with russia.   on the western half of the continent, there is a strong anti russian sentiment ... and anti russian politics has come into fashion,  orban said at a joint news conference with putin.  we had to defend our economic relations in this environment.  when asked about the church grant, foreign minister peter szijjarto told reuters:  we work together with all the churches very closely.  the 2.4 billion forint grant to russian orthodox churches compares to around 11 billion for similar investments and programs in other churches also in the 2017 budget. andras racz, an associate professor at pazmany peter catholic university, said that both sides wanted different dividends from the relationship.  the cooperation is pragmatic from both sides, just they want different things: the hungarian side wants primarily economic benefits ... while the russian side has primarily political and strategic motivations, which of course includes some long term strategic economic position building,  he said. after the soviet union collapsed in 1991, the russian orthodox church emerged from decades of oppression to find post communist politicians ready to help re establish its role. religion helped fill the ideological vacuum left by the failure of marxism, while the church, an integral part of russian history and culture, fitted well into the new nationalism.  the church has developed into a thriving institution that works closely with the kremlin to promote common interests.  with backing from oligarchs, it has built or restored tens of thousands of churches, mostly at home but also in over 60 countries including distant locations such as havana, caracas, bangkok and pyongyang. as the russian orthodox believers left the small, christian chapel in zalavar, with the smell of incense lingering, priests removed russian icons from the walls. some russian tourists were happy to hear that a church would be built in the spa town of heviz, where thousands of russians arrive on charter flights to take the waters of one of the world s biggest thermal lakes, landing at a nearby airport at a former soviet army base.   i think this is not only a matter of religion, but also our history ... so this is good, this is appropriate,  aleksander kulchitskii, on holiday from the russian city of ryazan, said. some hungarians, however, were less convinced. klara kispal, a pensioner on holiday in heviz, said she agreed with orban s anti migration policies but she could not support paying for a russian orthodox church in the town.  i don t think this is a good move... i am religious, roman catholic, and (the government) should promote our religion not a foreign religion,  she said.

" a u.s. missile strike on an airbase near the syrian city of homs on friday killed five people and wounded seven more, the homs governor told the lebanese tv station al mayadeen, saying he did not expect the casualty toll to rise by much. homs governor talal barazi, in separate remarks to reuters, said the targeted airbase had been providing air support for army operations against islamic state east of palmyra, and the attack served the interests of “armed terrorist groups”. “i believe   god willing   that the human casualties are not big, but there is material damage. we hope there are not many victims and martyrs,” he told reuters. u.s. president donald trump said he ordered missile strikes against an airfield from which a deadly chemical weapons attack was launched this week, declaring he acted in america’s “national security interest” against syrian president bashar al assad. barazi told al mayadeen there were civilian casualties at a village next to the base, but did not elaborate. the syrian observatory for human rights, a britain based organization that reports on the war, said four syrian soldiers were killed, including a senior officer. it was citing its own sources. the syrian army could not be reached for comment.  speaking at dawn, barazi said rescue and fire fighting operations had been going on for two hours at the base.    he said the attack was a form of “support for the armed terrorist groups, and it is an attempt to weaken the capabilities of the syrian arab army to combat terrorism”. speaking to syrian state tv, barazi said: “the syrian leadership and syrian policy will not change. “this targeting was not the first and i don’t believe it will be the last,” he added. in separate comments to al mayadeen, he said: “the war against terrorism will continue.”   u.s. officials said dozens of cruise missiles were fired against the base in response to the suspected gas attack in a rebel held area that washington has blamed on assad’s forces. the syrian government has strongly denied responsibility. the u.s. strikes “targeted military positions in syria and in homs specifically” in order to publicly “serve the goals of terrorism in syria and the goals of israel in the long run”, barazi added in his interview with state tv.

" a group of 37 u.s. based scientists whose research focuses on arctic wildlife asked two u.s. senators in a letter on thursday not to open the national arctic wildlife refuge to oil and gas exploration, according to a copy seen by reuters. the scientists, including several retired former officials from the alaska department of fish & game, the u.s. geological survey and the u.s. fish & wildlife service, said in a letter to senator lisa murkowski of alaska and senator maria cantwell of washington that drilling for oil and gas in the refuge would be “incompatible with the purposes for which the refuge was established,” protecting fish and wildlife populations and the environments in which they live.   murkowski, a republican, introduced legislation on wednesday that would create an oil and gas exploration program on the refuge’s coastal plain, letting prospectors build any roads and other infrastructure they deemed necessary inside the refuge to carry out their operations. half of the available drilling royalties would go to the state of alaska and half to the federal government. the program’s administrator would be required to hold at least two lease sales within 10 years after the bill became law.  the scientists said drilling on the coastal plain would be particularly harmful because it contains a “unique compression” of habitats supporting animals like polar bears, grizzly bears, wolverines, representing “the greatest wildlife diversity of any protected area above the arctic circle.” in a reuters interview, cantwell praised the scientists for spelling out why drilling would be so harmful to the refuge and she would work to oppose the legislation.  “to try to legislate mandated drilling in a wildlife refuge is just not where america is,” she said.  murkowski’s spokeswoman declined to comment and referred a comment request to the senate energy and natural resources committee.  the conflict over whether to allow drilling inside the refuge has deep roots. the u.s. geological survey estimates the area on the prudhoe bay in northern alaska has up to 12 billion barrels of recoverable crude, and republicans, who now control congress and the white house, have long wanted to open a portion of the refuge called the 1002 area.  murkowski, who chairs the senate energy committee, called the 1002 portion a “non wilderness area” because the government put it aside decades ago for petroleum exploration. last month, democrats tried and failed to pass legislation blocking drilling there.

" thousands of protesters gathered at an unsanctioned rally on saturday to demand action against prime minister najib razak over the mismanagement of billions of dollars by a state fund. malaysia s opposition are counting on the 1malaysia development berhad (1mdb) scandal to turn as many voters as they can against najib, who can call for national polls anytime between now and the middle of next year. the prime minister has so far been able to weather the scandal, consolidating power by clamping down on dissenters and curbing local media and activists even as he faces a fierce challenge from his former mentor, mahathir mohamad. but rising living costs and a broad based consumption tax are leaving people like hasmurni tamby, a 42 year old single mother of five, fed up with the way things are going under najib.  prices of everything have gone up but not our salaries. we can t save. so we don t want this leader anymore,  said hasmurni, who traveled several hours north from her home state of malacca to attend the evening rally. saturday s rally was touted as the finale of a two month long anti kleptocracy roadshow, a platform set up by the opposition pakatan harapan (ph) coalition to convince the majority malay muslim voters in rural battleground areas that the country has suffered from najib s handling of 1mdb. najib s popularity took a hit from persistent bad press linked to 1mdb, especially after the u.s. department of justice filed civil suits to recover over $1.7 billion alleged to have been misappropriated from the 1mdb fund. a rebounding economy and strengthening ringgit currency, however, are working in najib s favor. the prime minister is expected to announce plenty of people centric initiatives later this month when he tables his last budget before the polls. just a few months prior, he announced billions in housing and cash aid for the malay community. but mahathir, who saw through malaysia s industrialization as its longest serving prime minister, warned that nothing good will come out of allowing his former protege to continue to rule.  never before have we had a prime minister who is a thief. he steals so he can have a comfortable life,  mahathir told the crowd when delivering the final speech of the night.  we need to bring down kleptocracy in our country... najib s fate is in our hands. we can get rid of him, just by voting ph,  the former prime minister said.

" three people who claim they were assaulted at a donald trump rally in louisville, kentucky, last month have filed a lawsuit against the republican presidential candidate, saying he “incited a riot.” molly shah, kashiya nwanguma and henry brousseau filed the lawsuit on thursday in jefferson circuit court in louisville, claiming that trump’s repeated calls of “get them out” at a rally at the kentucky international convention center on march 1 was intended to direct his supporters to “use unwanted, harmful physical force to remove protesters, including the plaintiffs.” the lawsuit also names as defendants the trump campaign and three individuals who the plaintiffs claim assaulted them at the rally. the three plaintiffs, all louisville residents, claim they suffered physical injuries, emotional distress and humiliation, and are seeking unspecified damages, according to the lawsuit. “peaceful protest is an american tradition, especially in the context of presidential politics,” dan canon, the attorney for the plaintiffs, told reuters in a twitter message. “but what you see all over the country, time and time again, is violence employed against protesters at trump campaign events. these plaintiffs are saying ‘enough is enough,’”  the lawsuit said trump stopped his 30 minute speech five times to point out protesters and, in most cases, told supporters to “get ‘em out of here,” according to the lawsuit. a spokeswoman for trump’s campaign could not be reached for comment. the lawsuit claims that trump “incited a riot as defined under the kentucky penal code.” the individuals named as defendants are matthew heimbach, described in the complaint as a trump supporter and ohio resident who is “affiliated with the traditionalist worker party, a recognized hate group”; alvin bamberger, 75, described as a trump supporter and an ohio resident; and an unknown female. according to the lawsuit, at the rally, heimbach, who was wearing a traditionalist worker party t shirt, attacked shah and nwanguma. a spokesman for the traditional worker party could not be reached. a website for the traditionalist worker party describes it as a grassroots political organization that believes, among other things, that “european american identity is under constant attack.” the southern poverty law center, a non profit organization that monitors groups it considers extremist, classifies the traditionalist worker party as a white nationalist hate group. according to the lawsuit, nwanguma was assaulted by numerous protesters at the rally, of whom heimbach and bamberger were the most aggressive. video of nwanguma, a 21 year old college student, being repeatedly pushed at the convention went viral after the rally, the lawsuit said. bamberger could not be reached immediately for comment. the lawsuit also claims that shah was assaulted by heimbach and that brousseau was assaulted by the unknown female defendant.

" president donald trump’s reelection campaign raised more than $10.1 million in the third quarter of 2017 and spent $4 million, including $1.1 million on legal fees.  trump’s campaign paid $237,924 to lawyer alan futerfas, who is representing donald trump jr. in matters related to the campaign’s involvement with russian interference in the u.s. election.  that payment came in addition to $50,000 paid the previous quarter to the same lawyer. futerfas has not responded to repeated requests for comment about the payment.  the campaign also paid $30,000 to williams and jensen, the law firm where karina lynch, who is also representing trump jr., works. lynch did not respond to request for comment about the payment.  during the third quarter, trump’s campaign paid more than $25,000 to his own company for “legal consulting,” as well as $800,000 to law firm jones day, which provides routine legal assistance to the campaign.   trump filed for re election the day he took office   allowing his campaign to continue to raise and spend money while he is in office. traditionally, presidents have waited two years to officially file for reelection, providing no historic comparisons to his level of fundraising and spending.  his campaign has raised more than $36 million since january. he has used that money to keep a small campaign staff, to fund campaign rallies and to pay legal fees associated with some of the investigations into his 2016 campaign.      trump’s campaign spent about $4 million in that same time period. in the second quarter of 2017, trump’s re election campaign raised about $8 million and spent $4.4 million.     of the donations, $1.2 million consisted of unitemized contributions, meaning money  from donors who gave less than $200. trump frequently touts the level of unitemized donations as proof that voters still support his campaign. he raised about $1.9 million in unitemized contributions during the previous quarter.

" the u.s. house of representatives on thursday overwhelmingly passed legislation to keep federal agencies funded until april 28 and avert government shutdowns at the end of this week when existing appropriations expire. by a vote of 326 96, the house passed the legislation that is now before the senate where it has encountered opposition from democrats who are upset over the refusal by republicans to include a long term extension of expiring healthcare benefits for retired coal miners and their families. instead, the bill would continue the benefits only until next april. “i’ve never seen anything this callous in my life,” said west virginia democratic senator joe manchin. as a result, the senate might not be able to vote on the spending bill until sometime this weekend, technically putting the u.s. government into a partial shutdown mode on saturday. flint, michigan, which has endured a two and a half year struggle with lead contaminated drinking water, would get access to a $170 million fund for infrastructure improvements and lead poisoning prevention under the bill. the stop gap funding bill reflects the inability of the republican controlled congress to pass the dozen regular appropriations bills for the fiscal year that began oct. 1 and runs through sept. 30, 2017, freezing most spending at current levels. congress was unable to pass them in part because of internal disagreements among republicans on some of those measures and because democrats held firm to an earlier budget deal that aims to restrain spending caps on defense as long as those caps were imposed on other domestic programs.          congress likely will end up arguing well into 2017 over spending priorities for the current fiscal year even as it must begin considering funding government operations in fiscal 2018. congress’ delay in finishing its work also means that president elect donald trump, who takes office on jan. 20, will have some say in government spending priorities for the period of april 28 sept. 30, instead of president barack obama. a provision is also embedded in the spending bill to make it easier for trump to win confirmation of general james mattis to be defense secretary early next year. republicans demanded it to help mattis get around a requirement that the defense secretary be a civilian for seven years before taking the job. mattis retired from the military in 2013. the bill moving through congress, as lawmakers try wrapping up their work for the year, contains $5.8 billion for waging military operations against the islamic state worldwide.

" seattle’s city council unanimously passed a pioneering income tax on the city’s highest earners on monday, a measure that has become a clarion call for democrats there even though it is likely to face a swift legal challenge over violating state law. the measure created a 2.25 percent tax rate on individuals earning above $250,000 and married couples jointly earning above $500,000. the tax will add roughly $140 million in new annual revenue and affect fewer than 20,000 residents in the city of more than 660,000, supporters say. the proposal has become a rallying cry for democrats and activists in the liberal leaning city who used local opposition to republican president donald trump to advance long sought after local policies. washington is one of seven u.s. states without a tax on personal income, and no city in the state has an income tax. supporters of the seattle proposal, including mayor ed murray, say the current tax code unfairly burdens poor and middle class residents because it relies on “regressive” taxes, such as taxes on property and sales transactions. proponents say new revenue is needed to offset any potential drop in federal funding under the trump administration. “our goal is to replace our regressive tax system with a new formula for fairness, while ensuring seattle stands up to president trump’s austere budget that cuts transportation, affordable housing, healthcare, and social services,” murray said by e mail after the city council’s 9 0 vote. earlier on monday, murray told a cheering crowd at a rally outside city hall he would sign the measure into law on friday and welcomed a legal challenge. the campaign for the new tax on seattle’s richest was launched earlier this year by trump proof seattle, a coalition of community activists and residents. proceeds from the tax could be used to pay for transit services and affordable housing, murray said. the city has been grappling with soaring housing prices in recent years, fueled in part by the growth of online retailer amazon.com, which is headquartered in downtown seattle. voters in olympia, the state capital, rejected a similar tax on its highest earners last year. in 2010, washington state voters rejected a state income tax at the ballot box. jason mercier, a director at the conservative washington policy center, said seattle’s tax conflicts with state law and court decisions. he said he expects the city to face a swift legal challenge after murray signs the measure into law. “there’s something fundamentally wrong with elected officials passing a tax they know is against state law and the constitution with the hope of being sued and having a judge overturn prior decisions,” mercier said.  state law blocks a county or city from levying a tax on “net” income, although net income is not defined in the statute. the washington state supreme court has found that income is treated as property under the constitution and therefore has to be taxed uniformly and at no more than 1 percent of its value, mercier said.

" france s foreign ministry on friday nuanced comments made earlier by its minister, suggesting that former lebanese prime minister saad al hariri may not be free and urging that he continue to play his rightful role in the country. foreign minister jean yves le drian had told europe 1 radio that as far as france was aware, hariri  was free of his movements  and that it was  important he made his own choices.   however, when asked by reporters in a daily briefing to clarify those comments, a foreign ministry spokesman said france wanted hariri to be free, suggesting he may not be.  we wish that saad al hariri has all his freedom of movement and be fully able to play the essential role that is his in lebanon,  deputy foreign ministry spokesman alexandre georgini said. he added that france s envoy to saudi arabia had seen hariri after a short trip to the united arab emirates earlier this week. french officials said the ministry s latest comments were the most accurate. france s ambassador to saudi met hariri before president emmanuel macron s unscheduled visit to riyadh to meet crown prince mohammed bin salman on thursday. paris has close ties with lebanon, a former colony, and with hariri, who has a home in france after spending several years in the country. macron said in dubai on thursday there had been informal contacts with hariri, but no request to transfer him to france. two top lebanese government officials said on thursday that riyadh was holding hariri captive and a third told reuters that the saudi authorities had ordered hariri to resign while he was in riyadh last weekend, and put him under house arrest. le drian is due in saudi arabia on nov. 16 and is scheduled to also travel to iran later in the month.

" kenyan police fired teargas and shots in the air to scatter a small number of demonstrators in nairobi two days before elections, as the main opposition leader appeared to pull back from a call for protests during the vote. in the western city of kisumu, around 2,000 demonstrators marched on the election board offices, witnesses said, heeding raila odinga s appeal for protests against thursday s repeat presidential ballot, before dispersing peacefully. odinga is boycotting the contest against incumbent uhuru kenyatta. he says it will not be free and fair as the election board had made insufficient progress towards reforms he demanded after the original election held in august was annulled. odinga had urged his supporters to ensure the new vote did not take place, repeatedly saying there would be  no elections . but on tuesday he told the bbc he was not calling for protests on election day itself.  we have not told people to protest on polling day. we have not said that at all. we have told people to stay away,  he said in a radio interview. when called for clarification, odinga s spokesman said he was saying  peaceful protests  would still take place and that the opposition would fully explain their plans on wednesday.  at least 49 people have died in political violence since the august ballot, evoking unwelcome memories of the aftermath of a disputed 2007 vote, when more than 1,200 people were killed.  on tuesday evening, the bodyguard of the deputy chief justice was shot and wounded as he bought flowers by the side of the road, police said.  the motive for the shooting was unclear, but it is likely to add to the tense atmosphere surrounding the vote. judges have received threats since they nullified the august result.  the political stand off has blunted growth in east africa s richest economy, a nation which values its stability and relative freedom in a region plagued by conflict.  kenya s supreme court is still hearing several cases challenging the legality of thursday s election.  one, brought by human rights activist khelef khalifa and two others, seeks to delay the vote on grounds that the election board is not sufficiently prepared. the supreme court, the only body that can now legally postpone the poll beyond the end of the month, will hear the case on wednesday.  on tuesday, the election board canceled a planned briefing with journalists on preparations for the polls.  last week, the head of the election board said it was not clear a free and fair vote could take place due to intimidation and political interference. he spoke after the resignation of an election commissioner, who then fled the country and released a statement saying she had been threatened, although she did not say by whom.  a day before the aug. 8 vote, another member of the election board was found tortured and murdered. on monday, the international crisis group, a global think tank, called for a delay in the election.  proceeding under current conditions would deepen kenya s ethnic cleavages and prolong a stalemate that has already claimed dozens of lives and come at a high economic cost,  it said.  both the election board and the government have said the vote will go ahead, irrespective of whether odinga contests it, and only a court ruling could legally delay the re run ballot beyond the end of october.  on tuesday, police fired teargas and bullets into the air to break up protesters in the capital nairobi. in kisumu, an odinga stronghold, demonstrators said that the polls should not take place, but were unclear on how they should be stopped.   all we know is that there will be no elections. as to how this will be done, we are waiting for the big announcement by baba (odinga) tomorrow,  said one demonstrator, market trader james ouma.  around him, marchers waved branches and blew whistles. last week odinga supporters disrupted at least three official pre polling events. police said some election board staff were seriously injured.  kenyatta won the first election on aug. 8, by 1.4 million votes, but the supreme court annulled that outcome on sept. 1 over procedural irregularities. odinga s team then presented a list of demands to the election board.  some have been met   opposition monitors will now have access to the board s computers as results come in, a key official has gone on an extended holiday, and numerical results vulnerable to typographical errors will not be transmitted, rather only scanned copies of paper forms from tallying centers.  the board said it was impossible to meet other demands   such as changing the technology provider   in the short time frame allotted for new elections.  under kenya s constitution, fresh elections must be held within 60 days of nullified ones.

" the white house on friday said it had asked congress for $44 billion in supplemental disaster assistance to help those hurt by recent hurricanes that hit puerto rico, texas, florida and the u.s. virgin islands, far short of the aid some officials have called for. the white house said it expected to seek additional funds after a fuller analysis. u.s. representative frank pallone and senator ron wyden, both democrats, called the request “a dereliction of duty by the trump administration to american citizens in puerto rico and the u.s. virgin islands that need our help. “this woefully inadequate funding request does not provide the necessary resources required to properly respond to the ongoing humanitarian crisis,” they added. puerto rico governor ricardo rossello asked for $94.4 billion to rebuild the u.s. territory’s infrastructure. texas was seeking $61 billion and florida had asked for $27 billion. the $44 billion would be in addition to about $50 billion congress previously approved for hurricane and disaster relief. white house budget director mick mulvaney said in a letter to house speaker paul ryan that the $44 billion “does not represent the final request” for assistance for the victims, especially in puerto rico and the virgin islands, where needs were still being assessed. “at this time, the administration is requesting an additional fiscal year 2018 funding in the amount of $44 billion and the necessary authorities to address ongoing recovery efforts,” mulvaney said in the letter. the administration also wants congress to approve new tax relief for victims of recent california wildfires, which mirror what congress awarded recently to hurricane victims. the white house also wants to make houses of worship eligible for disaster relief funding. senator john cornyn of texas, the no. 2 republican in the chamber, on thursday dismissed the latest request as “wholly inadequate” for his state. white house spokeswoman sarah sanders defended the request. “up until this point texas has not put any state dollars into this process. we feel strongly that they should step up and play a role and work with the federal government in this process. we did a thorough assessment and that was completed and this was the number that we put forward to congress today,” she said. she said the new request “primarily addresses texas and florida those storms took place ahead of puerto rico. the assessment for puerto rico hasn’t been completed yet. once that’s done, we fully anticipate that there will be additional requests at that time.” ",0

" u.s. president donald trump’s administration told state and local officials on wednesday that it will use its infrastructure plan to create incentives for the private sector to finance or take over public entities like bridges, tunnels and highways.  transportation secretary elaine chao and white house budget director mick mulvaney told about 150 transportation officials at the white house the administration wants the private sector to play a bigger role in managing and financing public infrastructure. mulvaney said the administration wants to give states and cities “incentives to move stuff you might own off of your books and into the private sector.” he said that would result in states and cities “getting more money to do new stuff.” the administration has said it wants to spend $200 billion on infrastructure over 10 years, an amount the administration hopes will encourage another $800 billion in infrastructure investment by the private sector, but has not offered a detailed plan. the administration will need congressional approval, and some members of congress in both parties do not expect to take up the issue until 2018. “the largest piece of the package is going to be wrapped around incentives,” mulvaney said. he said the incentives will work well in densely populated urban areas in airport, bridge, tunnel, port and other projects. it is harder for rural areas to have private sector backed projects, citing the lack of potential “cash flow,” mulvaney said. for example, a bridge in a rural area would have less traffic and potentially less likely be a candidate for private funding. he said the administration plans to target some funds solely for rural infrastructure projects that may not work as private sector backed projects. chao said the plan is not yet final but said states and cities that secure some private sector financing “will be given higher priority access to new federal funds.” democrats want more direct federal spending. senate democratic leader charles schumer has pointed out that the trump budget unveiled in may cuts $206 billion in infrastructure spending across several cabinet departments, including $96 billion in planned highway trust fund spending. “$200 billion is a lot   but it is not $5 trillion, so you still want to be smart with it,” mulvaney said. the three prong infrastructure plan will also include backing for big “transformative” projects, mulvaney said. trump wants to look at new ways to build bridges, tunnels and ports. “the president is very interested in trying to find that transformative, infrastructure technology, that is this close to being ready for market,” mulvaney said.

" saudi arabian banks have frozen more than 1,200 accounts belonging to individuals and companies in the kingdom as part of the government s anti corruption purge, bankers and lawyers said on tuesday. they added that the number is continuing to rise. dozens of royal family members, officials and business executives have been detained in the crackdown and are facing allegations of money laundering, bribery, extorting officials and taking advantage of public office for personal gain. since sunday, the central bank has been expanding the list of accounts it is requiring lenders to freeze on an almost hourly basis, one regional banker said, declining to be named because he was not authorized to speak to media. the banker did not name the companies affected but said they included listed and unlisted firms across many sectors. he added that if the freezes stayed in place for long, they could start to hurt day to day business activities such as paying staff and creditors or making other transactions. a second banker said, however, that most of the frozen accounts belonged to individuals rather than companies, and that banks were being allowed by the regulator to continue to fund existing commitments. a central bank spokesman was not available to comment. among top business executives detained in the probe are billionaire prince alwaleed bin talal, chairman of investment firm kingdom holding 4280.se; nasser bin aqeel al tayyar, founder of al tayyar travel 1810.se; and amr al dabbagh, chairman of builder red sea international 4230.se. the stocks of all three companies, which have issued statements saying they continue to operate as normal, plunged between 9 and 10 percent on tuesday. one of the bankers speaking to reuters said the central bank had met with some foreign banks this week to reassure them that the freezing of accounts targeted individuals, and that firms linked to those people would not be damaged.

" u.s. banking rules must protect the financial system but they need “some refinement,” president donald trump’s nominee for the federal reserve’s top regulatory post told lawmakers on wednesday. “as with any complex undertaking, after the first wave of reform, and with the benefit of experience and reflection, some refinements will undoubtedly be in order,” randal quarles told the senate banking committee in prepared testimony ahead of his confirmation hearing scheduled for thursday. if confirmed by the senate, quarles will be the central bank’s top official tasked with protecting the stability of the financial system. quarles worked as a wall street lawyer and u.s. treasury official under president george w. bush. he was also an executive with private equity firm carlyle group lp (cg.o) and is expected to face tough questions from democratic lawmakers. republicans control the senate and have the votes to confirm quarles over any objections from democrats. if confirmed, quarles would step down from the cynosure group, an investment group he founded in 2014.

" nepalis began voting in the final round of municipal elections on monday, an important step before a general election in november that will complete a near decade long democratic transition after the abolition of nepal s monarchy. the final round of voting covers parts of the restive southern plains that border india and are dominated by the ethnic madhesi people. more than 2.6 million people are eligible to choose more than 6,000 representatives in 136 municipal, officials said. voting in the area had been delayed since june after the rastriya janata party nepal (rjpn), which dominates the area, called for a boycott of the poll, a call that was only partially successful. scores of people were killed in 2015 and 2016, mainly in clashes with police, in protests by the madhesis against a new constitution that they said left them marginalised and favoured those living in the hills.     the madhesis are demanding a unified homeland and greater participation in state organs, including parliament, the judiciary, bureaucracy, and the national army. however, lawmakers rejected a government proposal last month to amend the constitution and meet some of the madhesis  demands. pressure had mounted on the rjpn to take part in the municipal polls after some of its members quit the party and took part in the second round of polls in june. the first round was held in may.  we ll now take our demands to the people through this election and get them passed in future with their support,  sarbendra nath shukla, a senior rjpn leader, told reuters. the municipal elections, the first since 1997, are an attempt by the national government to restore democracy at the local level after a decade long civil war that ended in 2006 and years of instability after the monarchy was abolished in 2008. they will serve as a barometer of public opinion ahead of the nov. 26 general election.

" republicans and democrats will battle in a dozen u.s. states that will hold elections for governor on tuesday, and many of the races could be close calls.  drawing national attention because of a debate over transgender rights, republican governor pat mccrory is seeking a second term against roy cooper, a democrat who has been the state’s attorney general since 2001. polls show cooper with a modest lead in a state that also has competitive races for president and the u.s. senate.  in one of the year’s closest gubernatorial races, polls put republican former navy seal eric greitens in a dead heat with democrat chris koster, the state’s attorney general. they are bidding to succeed governor jay nixon, a democrat who has served the maximum two terms in office.  indiana governor mike pence, who initially sought re election, withdrew from the gubernatorial race in july to campaign as republican presidential nominee donald trump’s running mate. lieutenant governor eric holcomb, a republican, stepped in for pence and will compete against democrat john gregg, a former state lawmaker. gregg narrowly leads holcomb, according to polls. democratic businessman jim justice leads republican state senate president bill cole in polls, though data is sparse. democratic governor earl ray tomblin was barred by term limits from running again.  democratic governor steve bullock is battling republican tech entrepreneur greg gianforte to keep his seat. a poll conducted last month by mason dixon polling and research put bullock ahead of gianforte 47 percent to 45 percent.  democrat colin van ostern has a modest lead over republican chris sununu in recent polls. both are members of the state’s executive council, which helps to administer state government, and are seeking to succeed democratic governor maggie hassan, who is running for the u.s. senate. the term is two years.  republican lieutenant governor phil scott and democrat sue minter, a former state transportation secretary, are vying to succeed retiring governor peter shumlin, a democrat. one poll last month gave scott a seven point lead, while another showed a dead heat. the term is two years.  democratic governor kate brown is favored against republican bud pierce, an oncologist. brown was sworn in last year after her predecessor, john kitzhaber, resigned in scandal. the election is for the final two years of kitzhaber’s term. polls put incumbent governor gary herbert, a republican, at an advantage over democrat mike weinholtz, a healthcare executive, in utah. herbert, who took office in 2009 after his predecessor, jon huntsman, resigned, is seeking a second full term.  democratic governor jay inslee is widely favored in the polls to win a second term against republican bill bryant, a businessman and former commissioner of the port of seattle.  republican doug burgum, a former microsoft corp executive, is expected to defeat democratic state representative marvin nelson in the solid republican state of north dakota. governor jack dalrymple, a republican who was eligible to run for re election in 2016, declined to seek another term. democrat john carney, a member of the u.s. house of representatives, had a wide lead in a university of delware poll last month against republican colin bonini, a state senator. democratic governor jack markell is prohibited by term limits from running for re election to the position he has held since 2009.

" the trump administration said on thursday that israel’s building of new settlements or expansion of existing ones in occupied territories may not be helpful in achieving peace with palestinians, adopting a more measured tone than its previous pro israel announcements. in a statement issued two weeks before israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu is due to visit u.s. president donald trump, the white house said the administration “has not taken an official position on settlement activity.” trump, a republican, has signaled he could be more accommodating toward settlement projects than his democratic predecessor, barack obama. the latest statement reflects slightly more nuanced language on how the new administration views settlement activity. “while we don’t believe the existence of settlements is an impediment to peace, the construction of new settlements or the expansion of existing settlements beyond their current borders may not be helpful in achieving that goal,” the white house said in a statement. the statement could disappoint israel’s far right, which had hoped trump would give an unqualified green light on rapid settlement construction in the occupied west bank and east jerusalem   areas israel captured in the 1967 arab israeli war.  in the first israeli reaction to the statement, danny danon, israel’s ambassador to the united nations, said it was too early to tell how it would affect future building. “it’s still too early to tell ... i would not categorize this as a u turn by the u.s. administration but the issue is clearly on their agenda ... the issue will be discussed when the prime minister (netanyahu) meets the president in washington,” danon told israel radio. “we will not always agree on everything,” he added.      u.s. secretary of state rex tillerson spoke by phone with netanyahu on thursday, the state department said. it did not say whether they discussed the white house statement. obama routinely criticized settlement construction plans and his administration often described settlement activity as lacking legitimacy and impeding peace. the white house statement came as israel has ratcheted up settlement activity. on wednesday, it said it would establish a new settlement in the occupied west bank, the first since the late 1990s. it also announced plans for 3,000 more settlement homes in the west bank, the third such declaration in less than two weeks since trump took office. an announcement a week ago by israel that it would build some 2,500 more dwellings in the west bank, where palestinians now seek statehood, drew rebukes from the palestinians and the european union.

" iran harshly reacted to president donald trump’s decision not to certify its nuclear deal with six major powers, and president hassan rouhani said tehran might walk away if the continuing agreement does not serve the country’s national interests. defying trump, rouhani said tehran will double its efforts to expand the country’s defense capabilities, including the country’s ballistic missile program despite the u.s. pressure to suspend it. trump said in an address at the white house that he would not continue to certify the multinational agreement and warned he might ultimately terminate it.  “no president can revoke an international deal ... iran will continue to respect it as long as it serves our interests,” rouhani said in a live television address, adding that trump’s speech was full of “insults and fake accusations” against iranians.  while trump did not pull the united states out of the agreement, aimed at preventing iran from developing a nuclear bomb, he gave the u.s. congress 60 days to decide whether to reimpose economic sanctions on tehran that were lifted under the pact. that increases tension with iran as well as putting washington at odds with other signatories of the accord such as britain, france, germany, russia, china and the european union, who say the u.s. cannot unilaterally cancel the 2015 nuclear deal between iran and world powers .  “the iranian nation has not and will never bow to any foreign pressure... iran’s deal cannot be renegotiated,” rouhani said. trump announced the major shift in u.s. policy in a speech in which he detailed a more confrontational approach to iran over its nuclear and ballistic missile programs and its support for extremist groups in the middle east. pragmatist rouhani backed iran’s elite islamic revolutionary guards corps (irgc), saying the irgc will continue its fight against “regional terrorists. “the irgc has always protected our nation against terrorists ... it will continue to help oppressed nations in the region,” rouhani said. iran accuses its regional rival saudi arabia of fuelling regional tension and the sunni muslim kingdom is at odds with tehran’s revolutionary shi’ite leaders in struggles across the arab world, including syria, yemen, iraq, bahrain and lebanon. the irgc is iran’s most powerful security entity and wields control over large swathes of iran’s economy as well as considerable influence within its political system.

"a russian bank has reported to u.s. authorities that mysterious communications resumed recently between one of its computers and an email server tied to president trump s business empire, and it has developed evidence the new activity may be the work of a hacker trying to create a political hoax, circa has learned.alfa bank is asking the u.s. justice department for help solving the mystery and pledged its full cooperation.alfa wants u.s. authorities to help unmask a computer inside the united states that it believes has been used to launch cyberattacks spoofing the appearance of a backdoor communication channel between moscow and america s 45th president, according to a source directly familiar with the bank s request.the bank believes  these malicious attacks are designed to create the false impression that alfa bank has a secretive relationship with the trump organization,  the source said, speaking on condition of anonymity.alfa bank has insisted since media stories began appearing last fall about the computer communications   known as domain name server lookups   that it has never had a relationship to trump or any of his companies and that any computer connections between the two parties  computers were innocuous. the resumption of the computer pings started last month, and alfa s cybersecurity experts traced evidence that the activity was actually being spoofed   or hacked  through a third party from a masked computer address inside the united states, the source said.  for entire story: circa newsin november of 2016, the intercept published a piece refuting a slate article that attempted to convince readers there was a connection between trump and the alfa bank servers: slate s franklin foer published a story that s been circulating through the dark web and various newsrooms since summertime, an enormous, eyebrow-raising claim that donald trump uses a secret server to communicate with russia. that claim resulted in an explosive night of twitter confusion and misinformation.the gist of the slate article is dramatic   incredible, even: cybersecurity researchers found that the trump organization used a secret box configured to communicate exclusively with alfa bank, russia s largest privately-held commercial bank. this is a story that any reporter in our election cycle would drool over, and drool foer did:the researchers quickly dismissed their initial fear that the logs represented a malware attack. the communication wasn t the work of bots. the irregular pattern of server look-ups actually resembled the pattern of human conversation   conversations that began during office hours in new york and continued during office hours in moscow. it dawned on the researchers that this wasn t an attack, but a sustained relationship between a server registered to the trump organization and two servers registered to an entity called alfa bank.these claims are based entirely on  dns logs,  digital records of when one server looks up how to contact another across the internet. the logs, first gathered by an anonymous researcher going by the moniker  tea leaves  (an irony that should be lost on no one) and shared with a small group of academics, were provided to the intercept and a handful of other news organizations. the new york times, the washington post, reuters, the daily beast, and vice all examined these materials to at least some extent and did not publish the claims.you can think of dns like a phone book that maps people s names to their phone numbers. for example, every time alice wants to call bob, she first looks up bob s phone number in the phone book, and then she dials the number into her phone. however, it s possible that alice might look up bob s phone number and not call him on the phone. it s even possible that she might look up bob s phone number over and over on a regular basis, over the course of months, without actually calling him. the dns look-ups that the intercept and others (including slate) reviewed are similar to records of alice looking up bob s phone number in the phone book, but to call that evidence of sinister collusion between the two is, politely, a stretch. these dns records alone simply cannot prove that any specific messages were sent at those times. in fact, they can t really prove anything at all, and certainly not  communication  between trump and alfa. this cannot be overstated: no one, not tea leaves, not his academic peers, and not franklin foer, can show that a single message was exchanged between trump and alfa.for entire story go to: the intercept ",1

" a u.n. human rights investigator called on iran on thursday to resolve a prolonged hunger strike by prisoners protesting against their conditions of detention and abrupt transfer to a high security section. u.n. special rapporteur asma jahangir voiced concern about 53 prisoners, including 15 followers of the baha i faith, who have been transferred to a high security section of rajai shahr prison in karaj, west of tehran, over the past few weeks. the bahai faith was founded in iran in the 19th century and activists say more than 300,000 adherents live in iran today. iran s shi ite government considers the faith a heretical offshoot of islam.  i am deeply alarmed by reports about the deteriorating medical conditions of the prisoners on hunger strike, and that their torture and ill treatment have continued since their transfer,  jahangir said in a statement. at least 18 of the 53 were known to be on the hunger strike, her office said. iranian foreign ministry declined to comment. exiled bahai leaders say hundreds of followers have been jailed and executed since the 1979 islamic revolution. the iranian government denies it has detained or executed people for their religion. jahangir said the prisoners were not allowed to take their belongings, including medicines, amid reports that they have also been deprived of adequate clothing, medical care and food.   depriving prisoners of having family contact, lawyers and adequate medical care is contrary to international law,  she added.  i urge the government of iran to look for a prompt solution to the extreme situation created by the hunger strike through good faith dialogue about the grievances and underlying human rights violations, ensuring full respect for their dignity and autonomy,  jahangir said. the baha i international community, in a statement on aug. 16, denounced the transfer as a  harsh move .  not only are these baha is unjustly imprisoned because of their beliefs, they are now also subjected to added pressures and ill treatment without any justification but also in contradiction with iran s own laws,  said diane ala i, the group s representative to the united nations in geneva. about 95 baha is are imprisoned in iran, all of whom it said had been  arrested solely because of their religious beliefs .

" west virginia governor jim justice, standing next to president donald trump at a rally on thursday night, announced that he was changing political parties, ditching the democrats and joining trump’s republicans. “i can’t help you anymore being a democrat governor,” justice told the crowd. “so tomorrow i will be changing my registration to republican,” he said to loud cheers. justice, a billionaire businessman with interests in coal and agriculture, won election in november as a democrat in his first attempt at political office. until 2015, he had been a registered republican. trump, who won west virginia by 42 percentage points over democrat hillary clinton, campaigned on a promise to bring back coal jobs, an important industry in the state. justice said his late mother would have told him about switching parties: “jimmy, it’s about damn time you came to your senses.” justice told the crowd he had met with trump twice at the white house in the past several weeks to present ideas on coal and manufacturing.    “he’s got a backbone. he’s got real ideas. he cares about america. he cares about us in west virginia,” justice said of trump, a fellow billionaire businessman. trump, who earlier in the day promised a “very big announcement” at the rally, welcomed justice into the party’s ranks.  “having big jim as a republican is such an honor,” trump said of the 6 foot 7 inch governor. with justice changing his affiliation, there are now 34 republican governors, 15 democrats and one independent. republicans will now control both the legislature and the governorship in 26 of the 50 states. republicans control both houses of the west virginia legislature.

" u.s. president donald trump said on monday he had made significant progress on trade issues during a fruitful trip across asia that saw governments roll out red carpets  like nobody has ever seen .  we ve made some very big steps with respect to trade, far bigger than anything you know,  trump told reporters in manila on the sidelines of a summit with leaders of southeast asian and east asian nations. he did not give details of his achievements on trade matters during a tour that took him to japan, south korea, china and vietnam before his last leg in the philippines capital. he said a statement would be issued from the white house on wednesday about north korea, and on trade, key issues of a trip he described as fruitful.  it was red carpet like nobody, i think, has probably ever seen,  he said. in vietnam at the weekend, trump and leaders of pacific rim nations agreed to address  unfair trade practices  and  market  distorting subsidies , a statement that bore the imprint of trump s efforts to reshape the global trade landscape. his  america first  vision has upset a traditional consensus favoring multinational trade pacts that china now champions. on the sidelines of the vietnam meeting, 11 countries kept alive a trans pacific trade deal whose future was thrown into doubt when trump withdrew from it in the name of protecting american jobs. chinese president xi jinping told the summit in vietnam that asia pacific nations must  uphold multilateralism , countering trump s message that the united states would stay out of trade deals that surrender its sovereignty. trump, by contrast, blasted the world trade organization and multilateral trade deals during his tour. some analysts expect tougher u.s. action may be imminent to fight trade imbalances with china exacerbated by its state led economic model.

" president donald trump’s administration has dropped plans for an executive order that will require all u.s. food aid to be transported on american ships after members of congress protested, congressional and aid sources said on friday. reuters reported on thursday that trump was considering issuing an order that would have increased to 100 percent the current requirement that 50 percent of such aid be transported on u.s. flagged vessels. senator bob corker, the republican chairman of the senate foreign relations committee, stopped short of confirming information about the order but said he had discussed the issue with trump and that he understands that the shift would have increased the cost of food aid and caused more people to starve. “i had a good conversation today with president trump,” corker said in a statement emailed to reuters. “as a businessman, he understands that expanding the cargo preference would substantially drive up the cost of food aid and cause more people to starve around the world,” corker said. the white house did not immediately respond to a request for comment. although unlikely to have any significant effect on the $4 trillion global cargo shipping industry, the initiative originally touted as part of trump’s “america first” platform might have slowed food aid getting to millions of people and do little to create jobs, critics said. aid groups, and members of congress from both parties have been working for years to lower, or eliminate, the 50 percent shipping requirement. the united states, the world’s largest provider of humanitarian assistance, spent about $2.8 billion on foreign food aid in 2016. about half of that is estimated to go to shipping and storage. the conservative leaning american enterprise institute said in a november report that shipping food aid on u.s. flagged vessels costs 46 percent more than aid shipped at internationally competitive rates and can take as much as 14 weeks longer. jeremy konyndyk, a former director of usaid’s office of u.s. foreign disaster assistance, welcomed the administration’s decision to drop the order.  konyndyk, a senior policy fellow at the washington based center for global development, said that with four potential famines in the world “it would have been the worst possible moment to be shifting money out of hungry mouths and into subsidies for big shipping conglomerates.” corker has been pushing for years to reform the u.s. food aid program, including by eliminating the cargo preference. he said in his statement he looked forward to working with congress and the administration to achieve “long overdue reforms.” after hearing about the possible executive order, several members of congress called the white house to express their concern, congressional aides said.  the administration’s budget proposal has suggested slashing foreign aid in general while increasing defense spending. that plan was also met with stiff opposition in congress, as lawmakers argued that “soft power” options such as food and medical aid and disaster recovery assistance can be effective tools in foreign policy that should not be discounted. supporters say trump’s initiative would not only create new u.s. jobs in the shipping industry but that u.s. controlled food shipments are important for national security because the u.s. fleet could be transferred to the military in case of a conflict.  food aid is a very small percentage of the worldwide sea cargo flow, critics argue, while the security issue is moot as most cargo ships are too slow for use by the 21st century military. they said the costs would also be far higher by eliminating competition for shipping contracts with lower cost international carriers, requiring more u.s. taxpayer dollars to feed fewer people.

" at least 65 media workers around the world have been killed doing their jobs this year, media freedom organization reporters without borders said on tuesday. among the dead were 50 professional journalists, seven citizen journalists and eight other media workers. the five most dangerous countries were syria, mexico, afghanistan, iraq and the philippines. of those killed, 35 died in regions where armed conflict is ongoing while 30 were killed outside of such areas. thirty nine of those killed were targeted for their journalistic work such as reporting on political corruption or organized crime while the other 26 were killed while working due to shelling and bomb attacks, for example.   it s alarming that so many journalists were murdered outside of war zones,  said katja gloger, a board member of reporters without borders.  in far too many countries perpetrators can assume they ll get off scot free if they re violent towards media professionals,  she added. the organization said more than 300 media workers were currently in prison, with around half of those in five countries, namely turkey, china, syria, iran and vietnam.

" french cement group lafarge paid close to 13 million euros ($15.2 million) to armed groups including islamic state militants to keep operating in syria from 2011 2015, human rights lawyers said on tuesday. they were speaking at a news conference on the course of french prosecutors  preliminary inquiry into lafarge s operations launched in june on suspicion of  financing of a terrorist enterprise . the lawyers for rights group sherpa said a large part of the money went directly or indirectly into the pockets of islamic state and that payments lasted until well after the closure of lafarge s jalabiya plant in september 2014. they were citing a figure pinpointed by prosecutors examining lafarge s activities in syria, in the throes of civil war since 2011, and drawn from an internal report by u.s. law firm baker and mckenzie for lafarge.  as part of the inquiry, the precise figure retained is 12,946,000 euros paid by lafarge between 2011 and 2015 to terrorist organizations, including the islamic state,  sherpa lawyer marie dose said. lafarge became lafargeholcim, the world s largest cement maker, in 2015 after a takeover by swiss holcim.  former lafargeholcim ceo eric olsen resigned in april after the company admitted it had paid armed groups to keep a factory operating in syria. his lawyer has said olsen will appeal against being put under investigation. sherpa and other human rights groups in france as well as the french finance ministry have filed suit against lafarge. sherpa wants the company to be placed under formal criminal investigation, like olsen, and also accuses lafarge of not cooperating with authorities and trying to hide important elements from the investigation. a lafargeholcim spokeswoman on tuesday rejected these accusations but would not comment on the 13 million euro figure.  lafargeholcim fully cooperates with the justice (authorities). thousands of documents have been given by the group to magistrates or seized during a search,  she said.  we strongly contest that the company is trying in any way  to limit the right of its employees or former employees to defend themselves...or (limit) their capacity to cooperate in a judicial inquiry,  she added. being placed under formal investigation in france means that prosecutors believe they have  serious or consistent evidence  that could result in prosecution. it is a step toward a possible trial, though the investigation can still be dropped. last friday the paris prosecutor also placed olsen s predecessor as ceo, bruno lafont, and his ex deputy for operations under formal investigation as part of the inquiry into lafarge activities in syria, the two men s lawyers said.

" a leading republican in the u.s. congress in june 2016 made a quip during a private meeting of fellow lawmakers that russian president vladimir putin could be making payments to donald trump, the washington post reported on wednesday. house of representatives majority leader kevin mccarthy made the assertion, the newspaper reported, saying the conversation was recorded last june, during the primary election season when trump was seeking to become the republican party’s presidential nominee. according to the washington post report, house speaker paul ryan, a fellow republican, interrupted mccarthy and urged republicans present to keep mccarthy’s remarks secret. the newspaper report quoted mccarthy saying, “there’s two people i think putin pays: rohrabacher and trump.” mccarthy fired back at the report on twitter on wednesday, saying, “this was an attempt at humor gone wrong.” a spokesman for ryan said the remarks were meant as humor and had been taken out of context.  “this entire year old exchange was clearly an attempt at humor. no one believed the majority leader was seriously asserting that donald trump or any of our members were being paid by the russians,” ryan spokesman brendan buck said. republican representative dana rohrabacher on wednesday told reporters that mccarthy’s quip was a joke. “the trouble is, when you ever try to be funny, it is really taken seriously by a third party, and that’s what’s happened here,” he said.      reuters does not have a copy of the tape and could not confirm authenticity or gauge whether mccarthy was joking.

" u.s. president donald trump’s son in law and close adviser, jared kushner, had at least three previously undisclosed contacts with the russian ambassador to the united states during and after the 2016 presidential campaign, seven current and former u.s. officials told reuters. those contacts included two phone calls between april and november last year, two of the sources said. by early this year, kushner had become a focus of the fbi investigation into whether there was any collusion between the trump campaign and the kremlin, said two other sources   one current and one former law enforcement official.  kushner initially had come to the attention of fbi investigators last year as they began scrutinizing former national security adviser michael flynn’s connections with russian officials, the two sources said. while the fbi is investigating kushner’s contacts with russia, he is not currently a target of that investigation, the current law enforcement official said. the new information about the two calls as well as other details uncovered by reuters shed light on when and why kushner first attracted fbi attention and show that his contacts with russian envoy sergei kislyak were more extensive than the white house has acknowledged.  nbc news reported on thursday that kushner was under scrutiny by the fbi, in the first sign that the investigation, which began last july, has reached the president’s inner circle.   the fbi declined to comment, while the russian embassy said it was policy not to comment on individual diplomatic contacts. the white house did not respond to a request for comment.  kushner’s attorney, jamie gorelick, said kushner did not remember any calls with kislyak between april and november.  “mr kushner participated in thousands of calls in this time period. he has no recollection of the calls as described. we have asked (reuters) for the dates of such alleged calls so we may look into it and respond, but we have not received such information,” she said. in march, the white house said that kushner and flynn had met kislyak at trump tower in december to establish “a line of communication.” kislyak also attended a trump campaign speech in washington in april 2016 that kushner attended. the white house did not acknowledge any other contacts between kushner and russian officials. before the election, kislyak’s undisclosed discussions with kushner and flynn focused on fighting terrorism and improving u.s. russian economic relations, six of the sources said. former president barack obama imposed sanctions on russia after it seized crimea and started supporting separatists in eastern ukraine in 2014. after the nov. 8 election, kushner and flynn also discussed with kislyak the idea of creating a back channel between trump and russian president vladimir putin that could have bypassed diplomats and intelligence agencies, two of the sources said. reuters was unable to determine how those discussions were conducted or exactly when they took place. reuters was first to report last week that a proposal for a back channel was discussed between flynn and kislyak as trump prepared to take office. the washington post was first to report on friday that kushner participated in that conversation. separately, there were at least 18 undisclosed calls and emails between trump associates and kremlin linked people in the seven months before the nov. 8 presidential election, including six calls with kislyak, sources told reuters earlier this month. . two people familiar with those 18 contacts said flynn and kushner were among the trump associates who spoke to the ambassador by telephone. reuters previously reported only flynn’s involvement in those discussions. six of the sources said there were multiple contacts between kushner and kislyak but declined to give details beyond the two phone calls between april and november and the post election conversation about setting up a back channel. it is also not clear whether kushner engaged with kislyak on his own or with other trump aides.  fbi scrutiny of kushner began when intelligence reports of flynn’s contacts with russians included mentions of u.s. citizens, whose names were redacted because of u.s. privacy laws. this prompted investigators to ask u.s. intelligence agencies to reveal the names of the americans, the current u.s. law enforcement official said. kushner’s was one of the names that was revealed, the official said, prompting a closer look at the president’s son in law’s dealings with kislyak and other russians. fbi investigators are examining whether russians suggested to kushner or other trump aides that relaxing economic sanctions would allow russian banks to offer financing to people with ties to trump, said the current u.s. law enforcement official.  the head of russian state owned vnesheconombank, sergei nikolaevich gorkov, a trained intelligence officer whom putin appointed, met kushner at trump tower in december. the bank is under u.s. sanctions and was implicated in a 2015 espionage case in which one of its new york executives pleaded guilty to spying and was jailed.  the bank said in a statement in march that it had met with kushner along with other representatives of u.s. banks and business as part of preparing a new corporate strategy. officials familiar with intelligence on contacts between the russians and trump advisers said that so far they have not seen evidence of any wrongdoing or collusion between the trump camp and the kremlin.  moreover, they said, nothing found so far indicates that trump authorized, or was even aware of, the contacts. there may not have been anything improper about the contacts, the current law enforcement official stressed. kushner offered in march to be interviewed by the senate intelligence committee, which is also investigating russia’s attempts to interfere in last year’s election. the contacts between trump campaign associates and russian officials during the presidential campaign coincided with what u.s. intelligence agencies concluded was a kremlin effort through computer hacking, fake news and propaganda to boost trump’s chances of winning the white house and damage his democratic opponent, hillary clinton.

" puerto rico’s debt crisis, if left unaddressed by the u.s. congress where legislation has stalled in the house natural resources committee, will result in the need to pay for a humanitarian aid package, congressman raul grijalva said on thursday. grijalva, the ranking democrat on the hnrc from arizona, said in a teleconference with reporters that it is an “either/or” situation as puerto rico faces $70 billion in debt it cannot pay off and a growing humanitarian crisis because it cannot afford maintaining basic social services. “either we begin this process, stabilize, create some carve out opportunities for essential services and/or wait for the crisis to get worse and then have to respond with humanitarian relief,” grijalva said, adding that a new draft of the bill had not been made available as of thursday morning. grijalva visited puerto rico this week and met with the island’s leadership and toured its main medical facilities. he said austerity alone is not going to stay the situation of degraded conditions for health, nutrition and education. “people talk about a bailout. thus far there is no money being talked about extended by the united states government,” grijalva said, adding: “we are talking about a piece of legislation that provides for a method of restructuring and for some accountability attached to that restructuring.” the republican chairman of the hnrc, rob bishop of utah, said he wants a bipartisan bill to emerge from committee but canceled an expected release of the legislation on wednesday while lawmakers hashed out language revolving around the status of the island of vieques, pensions and minimum wage rates. puerto rico defaulted on may 1 for a third time on some of its debt, missing a roughly $400 million payment owed by the government development bank, the island’s main fiscal agent. it faces a near $2 billion july 1 debt payment. the legislation’s basic structure still includes the creation of an independent oversight board to lead the restructuring of the u.s. commonwealth’s credit and work with the local government to develop an economic reform plan. on the issue of vieques, democrats are concerned the language regarding the transfer of federal land on the island, which is mainly a nature preserve, could leave it vulnerable to commercial development in the name of recreation. “our position has been from the beginning that vieques did not belong in this package of legislation,” said grijalva.

" president donald trump said on wednesday an unnamed foreign leader told him at the united nations last week that the country would soon announce plans to build or expand five automobile industry factories in the united states. “i just left the united nations last week and i was told by one of the most powerful leaders of the world that they are going to be announcing in the not too distant future five major factories in the united states, between increasing and new, five,” trump said in a speech on tax reform in indianapolis. he added the factories were in the automotive industry.  trump did not name the country or its leader. the white house did not immediately respond to a request for comment. trump met with japanese prime minister shinzo abe and 12 other leaders in new york at the u.n. general assembly meeting last week, but did not meet with german chancellor angela merkel who was in germany ahead of an election. automakers in japan and germany have both announced investments in the united states this year, with companies coming under pressure from trump’s bid to curb imports and hire more workers to build cars and trucks in the u.s.  investments to expand u.s. vehicle production capacity also reflect intensified competition for market share in the world’s most profitable vehicle market. in august, toyota motor corp (7203.t) said it would build a $1.6 billion u.s. assembly plant with mazda motor corp (7261.t). toyota also said this week it was investing nearly $375 million in five u.s. manufacturing plants to support u.s. production of hybrid powertrains. last week, german automaker daimler ag (daign.de) said it would spend $1 billion to expand its mercedes benz operations near tuscaloosa, alabama, to produce batteries and electric sport utility vehicles and create more than 600 jobs.    rival german luxury automaker bmw ag (bmwg.de) said in june it would expand its u.s. factory in south carolina, adding 1,000 jobs.  and last month, volkswagen ag’s (vowg_p.de) brand president herbert diess said the company expected to bring electric suv production to the united states and could add production at its tennessee plant.

" french public sector workers went on strike on tuesday against president emmanuel macron s plans to cull jobs and toughen pay conditions, forcing airlines to cancel hundreds of flights and disrupting school activities. civil servants, teachers and nurses marched through cities across france, from toulouse in the south to strasbourg in the east, before the day s biggest rally in paris. it is the first time in a decade that all unions representing more than 5 million public workers have rallied behind a protest call. turnout is an important indicator of public appetite for protest against macron s social and economic reforms, which the former investment banker says are needed to unlock economic growth and put public finances on a more sustainable footing.  as in other recent demonstrations, the number of protesters appeared low. while unions said some 400,000 people turned out across the country, the interior ministry put the figure at 209,000. the economy ministry said some just 14 percent of state civil servants had been on strike and just 9.5 percent in local administration. protests last month against labor law reform that were led by private sector unions failed to persuade macron to change policy course, but the french labor movement has traditionally been more muscular in the public sector.   we want to make our voices heard after months and months of attacks against the public sector and its workers,  said mylene jacquot, head of the civil servants  federation at the moderate cfdt, france s biggest trade union.    in particular, we want to force the government to make good on its promise regarding our spending power.  strike notices were lodged in schools, hospitals, airports and government ministries over plans to ax 120,000 jobs, freeze pay and reduce sick leave compensation. the civil aviation authority said 30 percent of flights at airports nationwide had been canceled but there was no disruption on the rail network. the ministry of education said fewer than one in five teachers were on strike. macron, 39, has come under fire in recent days from political opponents and the unions for treating workers with contempt after he was recorded describing a group of workers at a struggling factory as  kicking up a bloody mess .      that misstep came weeks after he called those who resisted reform  slackers . as crowds gathered near paris s place de la republique, protesters held aloft a placard with portraits of macron, his prime minister and finance minister reading:  the ones kicking up the bloody mess.  minor scuffles broke out between protesters and security services. eight people were arrested, the police said in a statement.  unions have been divided over macron s reforms so far, with only the communist party rooted cgt spearheading street demonstrations against the loosening of employment laws. in lyon, force ouvriere union boss jean claude mailly said he would not support the cgt s call for the labor law decrees to be scrapped after weeks of negotiations between government and unions. but he said there would be other battles to fight with a united front.   there are other issues ahead: unemployment insurance, pension reform, the matter of public services,  mailly said.

" the united nations began bringing african refugees to italy from libya on friday, evacuating them from detention centers whose conditions have been condemned by humanitarian groups as inhumane.  hundreds of thousands of migrants have fled conflict or poverty at home and are now trapped in libya, where they had hoped to pay people smugglers for passage to europe via italy. it is the first time the u.n. high commissioner for refugees (unhcr) in libya has evacuated refugees directly to europe. an italian c 130 military plane landed at an airport south the capital carrying 110 women and children, and a second flight is expected to bring more than 50 people later in the day. the african migrants, including many small children, were covered in blankets or bundled in coats as they disembarked from the plane on a chilly evening.  we really hope other countries will follow the same path,  vincent cochetel, unhcr s special envoy for the central mediterranean, said in a statement after the first plane arrived.    some of those evacuated suffered tremendously and were held captive in inhumane conditions while in libya. five of these women gave birth while in detention, with only the very limited medical assistance,  cochetel said. the unhcr estimates about 18,000 people are being held in detention centers for immigrants that are controlled by the tripoli government and it aims to evacuate as many as 10,000 next year. [nl8n1oj3eg] italy s catholic church will house many of the new arrivals in shelters across the country, church charity caritas said, as the migrants from eritrea, ethiopia, somalia and yemen go through the country s asylum request process.  migrant arrivals to italy have fallen by two thirds since july from the same period last year after officials working for the u.n. backed government in tripoli persuaded human smugglers in the city of sabratha to stop boats leaving. italy is also bolstering the libyan coast guard s ability to turn back boats.[nl8n1oe34j] italy s move to open a safe corridor for some of the migrants follows criticism by rights groups who have condemned the country s efforts to block migrants in libya in exchange for aid, training and equipment to fight smuggling.[nl8n1nk77c]   this should be a point of pride for italians,  interior minister marco minniti told reporters on the tarmac.  this is the just beginning. we will continue to try to open this humanitarian corridor.  migrant smuggling has flourished since the overthrow of muammar gaddafi in 2011, with more than 600,000 making the perilous journey across the central mediterranean in four years.  tens of thousands of migrants are estimated to be detained by smugglers, and the african union says that as many as 700,000 migrants are in libya. the unhcr has registered more than 44,000 as refugees and asylum seekers. the unhcr classifies friday s arrivals as  vulnerable  refugees, which means they are children, victims of abuse, women, the elderly or have disabilities.

" the right of lesbian couples and single women to have access to assisted reproduction was  a matter of social justice  and will likely be legislated next year, a french government minister said on tuesday. the move would mark a significant extension of gay rights in france, where violent protests preceded the legalization of same sex marriage and adoption by homosexual couples in 2013.    it was a campaign promise. it will be honored,  marlene schiappa, minister for gender equality, told bfm tv. she said a bill would likely pass through parliament in 2018.      current legislation means that gay women with sufficient funds travel abroad for artificial insemination while other women without the financial means cannot. schiappa said that was unjust. french law still restricts techniques such as artificial insemination using donated sperm to heterosexual couples. a national ethics committee said last june that it backed the idea of medically assisted procreation for female couples and single women. macron, president since may, had set such a recommendation as a prerequisite to any legislative action.

" india has denied visas for a delegation from the u.s. government agency charged with monitoring international religious freedom, the agency said on thursday. the delegation from the u.s. commission on international religious freedom had been scheduled to leave for india on friday for a long planned visit with the support of the u.s. state department and the u.s. embassy in new delhi, but india had failed to issue the necessary visas, the commission said. “we are deeply disappointed by the indian government’s denial, in effect, of these visas,” uscirf chairman robert  george said in a statement. “as a pluralistic, non sectarian, and democratic state, and a close partner of the united states, india should have the confidence to allow our visit,” he said. george said uscirf had been able to travel to many countries, including those among the worst offenders of religious freedom, including pakistan, saudi arabia, vietnam, china, and myanmar. “one would expect that the indian government would allow for more transparency than have these nations, and would welcome the opportunity to convey its views directly to uscirf.” the indian embassy in washington did not immediately respond to a request for comment. last year, despite a much heralded fresh start in u.s. india ties under indian prime minister narendra modi, the united states ran into problems arranging visits by the head of its office to combat human trafficking and its special envoy for gay rights. a u.s. state department official referred queries on the visa issue to the indian government, but highlighted remarks by president barack obama on a visit to delhi last year, in which he made a plea for freedom of religion in a country with a history of strife between hindus and minorities. in its 2015 report, the bipartisan uscirf said incidents of religiously motivated and communal violence had reportedly increased for three consecutive years. it said that despite its status as a pluralistic, secular democracy, india had long struggled to protect minority religious communities or provide justice when crimes occur, creating a climate of impunity.  non governmental organizations and religious leaders, including from the muslim, christian, and sikh communities, attributed the initial increase in violence to religiously divisive campaigning in advance of the country’s 2014 general election won by modi.  the report said that since the election, religious minorities had been subject to derogatory comments by politicians linked to modi’s bharatiya janata party and numerous violent attacks and forced conversions by hindu nationalist groups. u.s. law allows for imposition of sanctions on countries the commission terms “of particular concern,” but the uscirf’s recommendations are not binding and these are not automatically imposed.

" france criticized russia on thursday for calling into question an international inquiry into who is to blame for chemical weapons attacks in syria. russia has questioned the work and future of the joint inquiry by the u.n. and the organization for the prohibition of chemical weapons (opcw), and said it would decide whether to support extending the mandate after investigators submit their next report.  we cannot accept that the credibility and independence of these mechanisms are challenged on the grounds that their conclusions are not suitable for russia,  french foreign ministry spokeswoman agnes romatet espagne told reporters.  this undermines the international consensus that it is our responsibility to build to stop the use of these weapons in syria.  the inquiry, known as the joint investigative mechanism (jim), is due to report by oct. 26 on who was responsible for an april 4 attack on the opposition held town of khan sheikhoun that killed dozens of people. france, britain and the united states have accused syrian president bashar al assad s government of being behind the attack and the probe is expected to back those claims. the united states said on wednesday it would push the united nations security council to renew within days the jim s mandate, setting the stage for a likely showdown with russia, which backs assad and denies assad has used chemical weapons. france, under president emmanuel macron, has been pushing for closer cooperation with moscow, especially over syria, and has said dialogue with russia on enforcing a 2013 security council resolution to prevent the use of chemical weapons in syria was one of its priorities.  the jim (already) concluded in its august and october 2016 reports the responsibility of the syrian armed and security forces in three cases of chlorine use and islamic state in one case. the methodology of the investigation is indisputable,  romatet espagne said.

" hundreds of suspected islamic state militants surrendered last week to kurdish authorities after the jihadist group was driven out of its last stronghold in northern iraq, a kurdish security official said on tuesday. the suspects were part of a group of men who fled toward kurdish held lines when iraqi government forces captured the islamic state base in hawija, the official told reuters, asking not to be identified. the report of the sunni muslim militants fleeing, rather than fighting to the finish as in previous battles, suggested their morale may be crumbling, according to hisham al hashimi, a baghdad based expert on islamic state affairs.  they no longer seem to believe in the cause,  hashimi, who met some of those who surrendered in the dibis camp near kirkuk, told reuters.  he said they had fled to the kurdish held region to avoid summary executions at the hands of vengeful sunni arab tribesmen and iranian trained and armed shi ite muslim paramilitaries who assisted the iraqi army s offensive on hawija.   islamic state leader abu bakr al baghdadi released an audio recording two weeks ago that indicated he was alive, after several reports he had been killed. he urged his followers to keep up the fight despite setbacks in iraq and syria.  approximately 1,000 men surrendered over the last week. not all, however, are terrorists,  said the security official in erbil, the northern iraqi base of the autonomous kurdistan regional government. they handed themselves in to kurdish peshmerga forces near the kurdish held oil city of kirkuk, east of hawija, he said.  it s fair to say hundreds probably are isis (islamic state) members, but that will be clear after the debriefs.   the town of hawija and surrounding areas fell on oct. 5 in an offensive by u.s. backed iraqi government shi ite paramilitary groups known as popular mobilisation, as well as sunni tribal combatants. islamic state s last territory in iraq is now a stretch skirting the western border with syria, including the border town of al qaim. iraqi prime minister haider al abadi said on tuesday this last piece of territory would be recaptured before the end of the year, marking the final defeat of the militants in iraq. the militants also hold areas on the syrian side of the border, but are retreating there in the face of two sets of hostile forces   a u.s. backed, kurdish led coalition and syrian government troops with foreign shi ite militias backed by iran and russia. islamic state s cross border  caliphate  effectively collapsed in july when u.s. backed iraqi forces captured mosul, the group s de facto capital in iraq, in a nine month battle.

" the collapse of german chancellor angela merkel s talks to form a three way coalition government is  bad news for europe  given the leading role of the european union s biggest member state, the dutch foreign minister said on monday.  germany s political crisis was weighing on the euro and european shares after the pro business free democrats (fdp) unexpectedly pulled out on sunday from weeks of talks with merkel s conservatives and the ecologist greens.  it s bad news for europe that the government in germany will take a little longer,  new dutch foreign minister halbe zijlstra said on arrival for talks with eu peers in brussels.  germany is a very influential country within the eu so if they don t have a government and therefore don t have a mandate it ll be very hard for them to take positions.  germany s outgoing eu minister michael roth, a member of the social democrats who are not in talks on forming a new merkel government, said:  we all have an interest in getting a mandate so that we are able to take care fully of business in europe.   we have never had such a situation in germany. so, given the collapse of these exploratory talks, we will need to assess the situation and decide accordingly.  the spokesman for the eu s executive arm in brussels stressed the need for stability in germany, as did an official in french president emmanuel macron s office.  we are confident that the german constitutional process will provide the basis for the stability and continuity that has been a trademark of german politics and we hope this time will not be different,  said the european commission s margaritis schinas. while some in germany spoke of a possible new election, zijlstra said that was a bad idea and noted that the dutch government took seven months to form, which meant german parties could still return to talks after a pause. foreign minister didier reynders of belgium, which was without a government for 18 months after an election, sought to strike a lighter tone on germany.  in belgium we have a tradition to do that, sometimes it s very long,  reynders told reporters. zijlstra did not think the situation in germany affected the brexit talks specifically for now, as the eu was  waiting for a substantial offer from the british  on the exit bill. both roth and reynders agreed london must make a move on the money now. arriving at the same talks, the czech republic s eu minister, ales chmelar, said:  we are hopeful that we will have a strong government in germany sooner rather than later.

" canada will impose targeted sanctions against 40 venezuelan senior officials, including president nicol s maduro, to punish them for  anti democratic behavior,  the foreign ministry said on friday. canada s move, which followed a similar decision by the united states, came after months of protests against maduro s government in which at least 125 people have been killed. critics say he has plunged the nation into its worst ever economic crisis and brought it to the brink of dictatorship.  canada will not stand by silently as the government of venezuela robs its people of their fundamental democratic rights,  foreign minister chrystia freeland said in a statement. the measures include freezing the assets of the officials and banning canadians from having any dealings with them. the actions were  in response to the government of venezuela s deepening descent into dictatorship,  canada said. there was no immediate reaction from caracas, where the government established a pro maduro legislative superbody that has overruled the country s opposition led congress.  maduro has said he faces an armed insurrection designed to end socialism in latin america and let a u.s. backed business elite get its hands on the opec nation s crude reserves. the united states imposed sanctions on maduro in late july and has also targeted around 30 other officials. the canadian measures name maduro, vice president tareck el aissami and 38 other people, including the ministers of defense and the interior as well as several supreme court judges. canada is a member of the 12 nation lima group, which is trying to address the venezuelan crisis. a government official said freeland wanted to host a meeting of the group within the next 60 days. cyndee todgham cherniak, a trade sanctions expert at toronto law firm lexsage, said although limited in scope, the canadian measures were symbolic.  when you join other countries ... it makes the message louder,  she said by phone. canadian prime minister justin trudeau said on thursday he believed there was a chance for a political solution.  this is a situation that is obviously untenable. the violence ... needs to end and we are looking to be helpful,  he told reporters at the united nations. experts say individual measures have had little or no impact on maduro s policies and that broader oil sector and financial sanctions may be the only way to make the venezuelan government feel economic pain. u.s. president donald trump last month signed an executive order that prohibits dealings in new debt from the venezuelan government or its state oil company. earlier this month, spain said it wanted the european union to adopt restrictive measures against members of the venezuelan government.

" with photographs obliquely showing a new rocket design, north korea has sent a message that it is working on an intercontinental ballistic missile (icbm) more powerful than any it has previously tested, weapons experts said on thursday. if developed, such a missile could possibly reach any place on the u.s. mainland, including washington and new york, they said. north korea s state media published photographs late on wednesday of leader kim jong un standing next to a diagram of a three stage rocket it called the hwasong 13. missile experts, who scrutinize such pictures for clues about north korea s weapons programs, said there is no indication the rocket has been fully developed. in any case, it had not been flight tested and it was impossible to calculate its potential range. however, a three stage rocket would be more powerful than the two stage hwasong 14 icbm tested twice in july, they said. south korean and u.s. officials and experts have said the hwasong 14 may have a range of about 10,000 km (6,200 miles) and could possibly strike many parts of the united states, but not the east coast.  we should be looking at hwasong 13 as a 12,000 km class icbm that can strike all of the mainland united states,  said kim dong yub, a military expert at seoul s kyungnam university.  it s likely meant to show that they are working on a three stage design with greater boost and range,  said retired brigadier general moon sung muk, an arms control expert who has represented south korea in military talks with north korea. he said the pictures were intended to show that north korea was refusing to bow to international pressure to abandon its weapons programs.  the north is trying to be in control of the playing field,  moon said. wednesday s report carried by the kcna news agency lacked the traditionally robust threats against the united states, and u.s. president donald trump expressed optimism about a possible improvement in relations. state department spokeswoman heather nauert said it was unclear if the photos were taken before or after secretary of state rex tillerson on tuesday welcomed what he called the restraint north korea had shown recently in its weapons programs and said he hoped a path could be opening for dialogue  sometime in the near future.    we consider it overall a good first step that there haven t been any missile launches or testing for ...three plus weeks or so,  nauert told a regular briefing. however pyongyang needed to do a lot more to show it was willing to negotiate in good faith, she said.  the photographs were accompanied by a report of kim issuing instructions for the production of more rocket engines and warheads during a visit to the academy of defense sciences, an agency he set up to develop ballistic missiles.  we re getting a look at it to emphasize domestic production of missiles, and to advertise what s coming next,  said joshua pollack, a nuclear weapon and missile systems expert who edits the u.s. based nonproliferation review. the photographs were published as tensions between north korea and the united states appeared to have eased slightly since north korea tested the hwasong 14 and later threatened to fire missiles toward the u.s. pacific territory of guam.  kyungnam university s kim said the hwasong 13 appeared similar to the kn 08, a three stage missile of which only a mockup has previously been seen at military parades. but the new images show a modified design for the main booster stage that clusters two engines. another picture published by north korean state media showed kim jong un standing next to a rocket casing that appeared to be made of a material that could include plastic. experts said if such material were used in the missile, it would be intended to reduce weight and boost range. the photographs also showed the design for the pukguksong 3, likely a new solid fuel intermediate range ballistic missile being developed for submarine launches.

" german chancellor angela merkel on sunday urged party leaders negotiating a tricky three way coalition government to show more willingness to compromise, as support for her conservative bloc plunged to the lowest level in more than six years. merkel s conservatives, who bled support to the far right alternative for germany in a sept. 24 election, are trying to forge an alliance with the pro market free democrats (fdp) and the left leaning greens which is untested at the national level. despite three weeks of exploratory talks, the unlikely partners still have to overcome differences over climate protection, energy, transport, immigration and euro zone policy. speaking ahead of a meeting in which party leaders were expected to sum up progress made so far and bridge some gaps, merkel said all parties had first exchanged their views and then consolidated the approaches by highlighting their differences.  now in this third phase, the task is to find compromises,  merkel said, adding that there was still a lot of work to do.  but from my point of view, a solution can be reached with goodwill,  merkel said.  if this will be achieved, we ll not know before the end of the week, however.  fdp leader christian lindner put the onus on merkel s  christian democrats (cdu) and her bavarian csu allies, saying his party and the greens had already given ground.  the greens and the fdp have moved. now it s up to the conservatives to show some flexibility. i assume there is goodwill from all sides,  lindner said. katrin goering eckardt from the greens said she wanted to see a leap from the other negotiation partners. but csu leader horst seehofer declined to comment when asked by reporters what compromises he was willing to offer. the greens made concessions on tuesday by no longer insisting on fixed dates to ban cars with combustion engines and to shut down coal fired power stations. the fdp gave ground by accepting more modest income tax cuts than an election campaign pledge of up to 40 billion euros in relief. lindner also dropped an election manifesto pledge to phase out the esm euro zone bailout fund. merkel wants to have an agreement in principle by nov. 16 on moving ahead to formal coalition negotiations to form a black yellow green government   dubbed a  jamaica coalition  because the parties  colours match those of that country s flag. with less than a week to go, the exploratory coalition talks are not only complicated by the differences between the parties, but also by splits within the political parties themselves   especially within the conservatives and greens. a breakdown of the talks could mean fresh elections in germany,  europe s biggest economy, since the social democrats (spd)   the second biggest party   have made clear they have no appetite for joining another  grand coalition  under merkel. a survey by emnid for bild am sonntag newspaper showed only 30 percent would vote for merkel s cdu/csu bloc if there were a federal election this sunday, down 1 percentage point. this is the lowest reading for the conservatives in this survey since october 2011 and marks a slump in support since the sept. 24 election, in which merkel s bloc won 32.9 percent. touching on one of the thorniest issues, merkel said on saturday that germany should lead the fight against climate change and cut emissions without destroying industrial jobs. merkel s comments, made in her weekly podcast and in the middle of talks on limiting global warming attended by about 200 nations in the western german city of bonn, highlighted the dilemma facing the centre right leader in the negotiations. while the cdu/csu and the fdp want to spare companies from additional burdens, the greens want to spell out which measures the next government will implement for germany to reach its 2020 goal of lowering emissions by 40 percent from 1990 levels. due to strong economic growth and higher than expected immigration, germany is at risk of missing its emissions target without any additional measures.

" rival palestinian factions hamas and fatah signed a reconciliation deal on thursday after hamas agreed to hand over administrative control of gaza, including the key rafah border crossing, a decade after seizing the enclave in a civil war. the deal brokered by egypt bridges a bitter gulf between the western backed mainstream fatah party of palestinian president mahmoud abbas and hamas, an islamist movement designated as a terrorist group by western countries and israel. palestinian unity could also bolster abbas s hand in any revival of talks on a palestinian state in israeli occupied territory. internal palestinian strife has been a major obstacle to peacemaking, with hamas having fought three wars with israel since 2008 and continuing to call for its destruction.       hamas s agreement to transfer administrative powers in gaza to a fatah backed government marked a major reversal, prompted  partly by its fears of financial and political isolation after its main patron and donor, qatar, plunged in june into a major diplomatic dispute with key allies like saudi arabia. they accuse qatar of supporting islamist militants, which it denies. israel viewed the palestinian accord warily, saying it must abide by previous international agreements and terms set out by the quartet of middle east peace mediators   including the recognition of israel and the disarming of hamas.  israel will examine developments in the field and act accordingly,  said a statement from prime minister benjamin netanyahu s office. thousands of palestinians took to the streets across gaza on thursday in celebration of the unity pact, with loudspeakers on open cars blasting national songs, youths dancing and hugging and many waving palestine and egyptian flags. egypt helped mediate several previous attempts to reconcile the two movements and form a power sharing unity government in gaza and the west bank, where abbas and the fatah led palestinian authority (pa) are based.  hamas and fatah agreed in 2014 to form a national reconciliation government, but the deal soon dissipated in mutual recriminations with hamas continuing to dominate gaza.  the legitimate government, the government of consensus, will return according to its responsibilities and according to the law,  fatah delegation chief azzam al ahmed said at the signing ceremony in cairo. he said the unity government would  run all institutions without exception,  including all border crossings with israel and in rafah, gaza s only access point with egypt. the agreement calls for abbas s presidential guard to assume responsibility of the rafah crossing on nov. 1, and for the full handover of administrative control of gaza to the unity government to be completed by dec. 1. analysts said the deal is more likely to stick than earlier ones, given hamas s growing isolation and realization of how hard gaza, its economy hobbled by border blockades and infrastructure shattered by wars with israel, was to govern and rebuild. deeper egyptian involvement, believed to have been backed by saudi arabia and other arab states, also helped cement the deal.  we in hamas are determined and are serious this time and just like all other times ... we have dissolved the administrative committee (shadow government)... we have opened the door to reaching this reconciliation,  saleh arouri, the head of hamas negotiators in cairo, said after the signing ceremony. delegations from the two rivals have been in talks in cairo this week to work out the details of the administrative handover, including security in gaza and at border crossings. key was the rafah crossing, once the gateway to the world for the 2 million people packed into the small impoverished territory. fatah said it should be run by the presidential guards, supervised by the european union border agency, eubam, instead of the hamas linked employees now deployed.  eubam rafah maintains readiness to redeploy to the rafah crossing point when the security and political situations will allow,  said mohammad al saadi, press officer for the eu coordinating office for palestinian police support. any decision on eubam deployment would be taken in conjunction with the palestinian authority and israel s government, he said in a statement.  some 3,000 fatah security officers are to join the gaza police force. but hamas would remain the most powerful armed palestinian faction, with around 25,000 well armed militants.  both rivals hope the deal s proposed deployment of security personnel from the pa to gaza s borders will encourage egypt and israel to lift tight restrictions at frontier crossings   a step urgently needed to help gaza revive a war shattered economy. another major issue in talks on the deal was the fate of 40,000 to 50,000 employees hamas has hired in gaza since 2007, a thorny point that helped crash the 2014 unity accord. under the deal, these employees will receive 50 percent of what their pa salary would be   or equivalent to what they are paid now by hamas   pending vetting of their professional qualifications.     hamas and fatah are also debating a potential date for presidential and legislative elections and reforms of the palestine liberation organization, which is in charge of long stalled peace efforts with israel. the last palestinian legislative election was in 2006, when hamas scored a

" north carolina on thursday repealed a law restricting bathroom use for transgender people, hoping to bring back businesses and sports leagues that boycotted the southern state because they saw the year old measure as discriminatory. however, the new law replacing the old one bans cities in the state from passing their own anti discrimination protections for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (lgbt) people until 2020, drawing scorn from civil rights advocates and casting doubt on whether boycotting businesses will return to the state. democratic governor roy cooper signed the replacement bill into law after the republican controlled state senate and house of representatives approved it in separate votes in the capital, raleigh. the new measure rescinds house bill 2, the so called bathroom bill also popularly known as hb 2, which required transgender people to use the bathrooms, changing rooms and showers in state run buildings that correspond to the sex on their birth certificate rather than their gender identity.  hb 2’s enactment a year ago prompted boycotts that cost the state economy hundreds of millions of dollars. deutsche bank ag and paypal holdings inc reversed expansion plans in the state. entertainers such as bruce springsteen and itzhak perlman canceled concerts.  in basketball crazed north carolina, the withdrawal of national collegiate athletic association (ncaa) tournament games and the national basketball association all star game, which had been awarded to charlotte, reverberated throughout the state. under the new law, transgender people are once again free to use the bathroom of their choice, but they lack any recourse should a person, business or state entity eject or harass them. the new law also denies lgbt people state legal protections in other areas such as employment and housing. outraged lgbt advocates, who had wanted an unconditional repeal of hb 2, were already pressuring business and sports organizations not to return. “this (is) the end of hb 2 in name only. the bill that was passed today is a disgrace, not a ‘fix,’ a ‘reset,’ or a ‘compromise,’ and certainly not a repeal,” mara keisling, director of the washington based national center for transgender equality, said in a statement. “putting any kind of moratorium on civil rights, whether six months or three years long, is dangerous and wrong,” she said. deutsche bank, which in response to hb 2 froze plans to create 250 jobs at its location in cary, north carolina, declined to comment on thursday. elected political rivals on both sides of the issue claimed at least partial victories in reaching the compromise that produced the new law. both cooper and the republican house speaker said they expected the ncaa to once again schedule championship events. ncaa president mark emmert said at a news conference posted online by the raleigh news and observer newspaper that the board of directors would decide whether the change is sufficient to spur a return. the deal to replace hb 2 came together on wednesday night, just ahead of an ncaa deadline to amend the law. the governor told reporters the law was imperfect but said thursday’s action would help begin repairing north carolina’s damaged reputation. “i wish this were a complete, total repeal, and whenever i get the chance to do that i will do that. ... i’m going to fight every single day for lgbt protections,” cooper said. hb 2 was passed in response to an ordinance in charlotte, the state’s largest city, that permitted transgender people to use the bathrooms matching their gender identity. the charlotte ordinance alarmed social conservatives who, without evidence, feared it would endanger women and girls in intimate spaces. house speaker tim moore said the new state law protected bathroom safety, but some social conservatives were unsatisfied.   “the truth remains, no basketball game, corporation, or entertainment event is worth even one little girl losing her privacy and dignity to a boy in the locker room, or being harmed or frightened in a bathroom,” said tami fitzgerald, executive director of the nc values coalition in raleigh and an outspoken supporter of hb 2. cooper, the former state attorney general, has opposed hb 2 from the outset. he unseated former republican governor pat mccrory last year in large part because of the law’s political and economic fallout, political analysts say.

" a german court on wednesday ordered the release of an army officer suspected of planning to carry out an attack on politicians and incriminate asylum seekers, saying there was not enough evidence to keep him in detention. the officer, named only as franco a., was arrested in april in a case that shocked germans and stirred a debate about the depth of right wing radicalism in the country s military. prosecutors suspected that franco a., along with two accomplices, wanted to implicate refugees in their planned attack by posing under a false identity as an asylum seeker. former president joachim gauck and justice minister heiko maas were on a list of possible targets prepared by the suspects, who wanted to make their attack look like the work of islamist militants, prosecutors had said. however, the federal court of justice ruled on wednesday that there was not enough evidence that franco a. was preparing an attack to keep him in detention, even if there were some grounds for suspicion. investigators must now make clear whether they have enough evidence to bring the officer to trial. a suspected accomplice was freed in july pending trial, while the other suspect was released for lack of evidence. the case had put pressure on chancellor angela merkel s government, with her close ally, defence minister ursula von der leyen, facing criticism for failing to deal with right wing extremism in the army and also because she implied that most soldiers were right wing radicals. franco a., who served with an army battalion stationed in france, had used a fake identity to register as a syrian refugee and moved into a shelter for migrants in bavaria even though he speaks no arabic. the soldier had previously been detained in late january by austrian authorities on suspicion of having hidden an illegal gun in a bathroom at vienna s main airport.

" a vietnamese student activist was jailed for six years plus four years of probation by a local court on wednesday for conducting propaganda against the state, his lawyer said. despite sweeping reforms to its economy and growing openness to social change, including gay, lesbian and transgender rights, vietnam s sole communist party retains tight media censorship and does not tolerate criticism. phan kim khanh, 24, is a student studying international relations and the eldest child of a catholic farming family in a remote area north of capital hanoi. he had written blogs criticizing the government before he was arrested earlier this year.  the proof used in court against khanh was vague,  lawyer ha huy son told reuters, adding he was not certain if khanh wants to appeal. human rights watch on tuesday called on vietnam to drop all charges and release khanh.  the bogus crime of conducting propaganda against the state is designed to silence peaceful critics of the vietnamese authorities,  said brad adams, human rights watch s asia director.   vietnam ought to get rid of these laws and stop persecuting students and ordinary people for just talking about the country s problems on the internet.

" a judge on tuesday tossed out a legal challenge to a problem plagued presidential preference election in arizona, ruling that the woes at the polls were not due to fraud. maricopa county superior court judge david gass said there were insufficient grounds for granting the request to void the results of the march 22 nominating election, which was marked by long lines and controversy.  in a ruling from the bench, gass said there were glitches and possible missteps by election officials but that the results would not have changed. “elections are human endeavors. they are never, ever perfect,” gass said. “glitches are always something that we need to wary of and we need to work hard, and we need to fix them.... but they don’t rise to the level of fraud.” gass issued his verbal decision following a two day hearing on the lawsuit brought by tucson resident john brakey, who alleged that election officials committed misconduct. the lawsuit argued officials improperly handled voter registration requests and permitted illegal votes to be cast in the election. he also said erroneous ballots were counted and the number of polling locations were inadequate. he sought a repeat of the election, easily won by democrat hillary clinton and republican donald trump. brakey’s attorney michael kielsky told reuters on tuesday night that he was disappointed in the ruling, but that it likely will not be appealed. the election brought widespread criticism to arizona, which saw frustrated voters wait in line for as long as five hours to cast their ballots at a drastically reduced number of polls.  in a cost cutting move, county election officials slashed the polling locations to 60, compared with 200 in the election in 2012.  officials immediately took the blame for the mistake, saying the decision was based on past voter turnout and an increase in mail in votes. the election also faces a separate federal court challenge by the state and national democratic parties, along with the clinton and sanders campaigns. justice department officials additionally have launched a probe into the handling of the election.

" republicans in the u.s. congress reached a deal on tax legislation on wednesday, clearing the way for final votes next week on a package that, if approved, would be sent to president donald trump to sign into law. formal language of the legislation, expected to add at least $1 trillion to the $20 trillion national debt over a decade, has not been released. the following are known provisions on which house of representatives and senate tax writers have agreed, based on conversations with aides and lawmakers: corporate tax rate: falls to 21 percent from 35 percent. the house and senate bills, as well as trump, had earlier proposed 20 percent. going to 21 percent gave tax writers more federal revenue needed to allow the tax cut to take effect immediately. u.s. corporations have been seeking a large tax cut like this for many years.  pass through businesses: creates a 20 percent business income deduction for owners of pass through businesses, such as sole proprietorships and partnerships. the house had proposed a 25 percent tax rate; the senate, a 23 percent deduction.  corporate minimum: repeals the corporate alternative minimum tax, which was set up to ensure profitable companies pay at least some federal tax. clean energy: maintains production tax credit for wind energy and the $7,500 electric vehicle tax credit. the house had proposed repealing the electric vehicle credit and scaling back the wind energy credit. the senate version did neither. individual income tax rates: there will be seven brackets, and the top rate falls to 37 percent from 39.6 percent. the house had proposed maintaining the 39.6 percent top rate and condensing the current seven tax brackets to four. the senate had proposed cutting the top rate to 38.5 percent and maintaining seven brackets. permanence: the expectation is that individual tax rates will snap back to current levels in less than 10 years, possibly after 2024. the individual tax rates in the house bill were to be permanent. the individual tax rates in the senate bill were to expire after 2025. state and local tax (salt): both the house and senate had proposed scaling back the popular individual deduction for state and local tax payments by limiting it to property tax payments and capping that at $10,000. the compromise bill will keep that $10,000 cap, but allow for continued deduction of both state and local income tax payments, as well as property tax payments. mortgage interest: caps the mortgage interest deduction for new mortgages at $750,000 in home loan value, down from the current $1 million. the house had proposed a $500,000 cap. the senate bill left it at $1 million. estate tax: roughly doubles the exemption from the federal estate tax on inherited assets to about $11 million per person, or about $22 million per couple, but leaves the estate tax in place, mirroring the senate proposal. the house bill had proposed entirely repealing the estate tax over several years. obamacare mandate: repeals a federal fine imposed on americans under obamacare for not obtaining health insurance coverage. the house bill did not repeal the obamacare individual mandate.  anwr drilling: allows oil drilling in alaska’s arctic national wildlife refuge. the provision was sponsored by republican senator lisa murkowski of alaska.

" the u.s. senate will vote next week on the ratification of montenegro as the newest member of the nato alliance, senate majority leader mitch mcconnell said on thursday, after the trump administration urged lawmakers to take up the long delayed matter. reuters reported on tuesday that secretary of state rex tillerson had written to the leaders of the senate to say montenegro’s membership in the north atlantic treaty organization was “strongly in the interests of the united states.” all 28 of nato’s members must ratify montenegro’s accession before it can formally join the alliance. the vote in the u.s. senate was held up for months when at least two republican senators, rand paul and mike lee, blocked a quick vote. the senate’s republican leadership had not scheduled a more time consuming roll call vote until thursday. mcconnell announced in the senate that there would be a procedural vote on monday evening, which should clear the way for a final ratification vote later in the week. senate aides said they expected the senate would approve of montenegro’s nato membership when the vote takes place.

" u.s. attorney general jeff sessions stepped up the trump administration’s critique of so called sanctuary cities on tuesday, saying local and state policies to limit cooperation with immigration enforcement are a criminal’s “best friend.”  sessions’ remarks, at a gathering of law enforcement authorities in portland, oregon, came days after repudiation of his stance against the sanctuary movement in separate actions by a federal judge in chicago and the california legislature. the judge in chicago on friday barred the justice department from withholding public safety grants to cities unless they allowed u.s. immigration authorities unlimited access to local jails and provided 48 hours’ notice before releasing individuals sought for deportation. on saturday, california lawmakers voted to make california a sanctuary state, approving a bill barring local governments from forcing undocumented immigrants to spend extra time in jail just to allow immigration agents to take them into their custody. but under a compromise negotiated with governor jerry brown, the bill allows local police to notify the federal government if they have arrested an undocumented immigrant with a felony record. it also allows immigration agents access to local jails. sessions called on local jurisdictions that have sought to shield illegal immigrants from deportation efforts to reconsider, and he urged brown not to sign the california bill into law. president donald trump and his administration have insisted that the deportation crackdown is aimed at illegal immigrants convicted of serious crimes, and that sanctuary measures contribute to rising crime. “such policies undermine the moral authority of law and undermine the safety of the jurisdictions that adopt them,” sessions said. “that makes a sanctuary city a trafficker, smuggler or gang member’s best friend.” he cited cases in oregon and california in which illegal immigrants were charged with committing violent crimes after being arrested for relatively minor offenses by local police and then released, despite federal requests to keep them in custody. sanctuary supporters counter that enlisting police cooperation in deportation actions undermines community trust in local law enforcement, particularly among latinos, and they  question whether trump is really targeting dangerous criminals. “we’re not soldiers of donald trump or the federal immigration service,” brown said in a cnn interview on tuesday. he called the measure passed by california’s legislature “a well balanced bill.” portland mayor ted wheeler said in a letter to sessions that oregon state law dating back to 1987 prohibits state and local police from enforcing federal immigration law.

" a militant faction loyal to islamic state (is) has increased its following in northern somalia from a few dozen last year to up to 200 this year, a u.n. report said, days after the group came under u.s. air attack for the first time. the increase in strength of the is spin off group has attracted attention because some security officials fear it could offer a safe haven for islamic state militants fleeing military defeat in syria or iraq.   the islamic state of iraq and the levant (isil) faction loyal to sheikh abdulqader mumin   estimated...in 2016 to number not more than a few dozen..., has growing significantly in strength, and (now) consists of as many as 200 fighters,  said the report by a panel of u.n. experts obtained by reuters.    even a few hundred armed fighters could destabilize the whole region,  said a regional diplomatic security source.  it(air strikes) is a recognition from the u.s. that the situation in terms of the (islamic state) faction in puntland is becoming increasingly critical.   somalia has been riven by civil war and islamist militancy, though more in the south than in the north where the puntland region is located, since 1991 when clan warlords overthrew a dictator before turning on each other.      friday s air strikes failed to kill mumin, the security source said. but abdirizak ise hussein, director of semi autonomous puntland s spy service, said the strikes killed about 20 militants, including a sudanese fighter and two arabs.  almost all mumin s fighters are somali, the u.n. report said, though the group is believed to include a sudanese man sanctioned by the united states. the group also has contacts in yemen. it was unclear if the sudanese man under u.s. sanctions was the same one reported killed in the air strike.   the number of is fighters in puntland has increased. mostly they come from southern somalia and a few, including foreigners, come from yemen,  colonel abdirahman saiid, a military officer in puntland, told reuters. the u.n. report said defectors from mumin s faction reported the group had received money and orders from iraq and syria, and one member said he had seen mumin and another leader using truecrypt software to communicate with them. the united nations could not independently verify those claims.  mumin s group has been slowing increasing its activity over the past year. in late 2016, it occupied the port of qandala in puntland, a semi autonomous region, for a month.  earlier this year, it carried out its first attacks. its fighters killed four guards at a hotel in bosasso, the economic capital of puntland, in february. the same month, the group beheaded three men it had kidnapped. somalia s main islamist insurgent group, al shabaab, is aligned with al qaeda and is most active in the horn of africa country s south. it has repeatedly clashed with the islamic state aligned faction in the north.

" a state judge on friday struck down a kansas voter registration system that would have prevented people from voting in state and local elections unless they show proof of u.s. citizenship. the judge ruled that the loss of voting rights for more than 18,000 kansas residents “far outweighs” the risk posed by potential voter fraud, as the state mentioned only about two dozen people who may have attempted to improperly register to vote over the last 13 years. “the right of citizen suffrage forms the foundation of a democratic society,” larry hendricks, district judge in shawnee county, wrote in a 19 page ruling. “whenever the laws of a state and the federal government clash with respect to this right, cracks are bound to appear in the framework of democracy.” kansas has had one of the strictest voter identification statutes in the united states, making the state a symbol for mostly republican party supporters who say the rules are meant to prevent voter fraud. opponents, mostly democrats, say the rules discriminate against minorities. kansas secretary of state kris kobach said by phone on friday he planned to appeal the ruling adding, “i regard the decision as wrong ... and this decision stands in the way of protecting our elections.” the american civil liberties union’s lawsuit said the voter registration system established by kobach violated the state’s constitution and state law and called it “two tiered.”  “this ruling is a victory for kansas voters and a stinging rebuke of secretary kobach’s repeated efforts to improperly use his authority to obstruct their access to the ballot,” aclu voting rights project staff attorney sophia lakin said in a statement. the aclu said the system would have denied the right to vote in state and local elections to residents who registered through a federal voter registration form or when they applied for or renewed their driver’s license. under the rejected system, those people could have voted in federal elections but would have had to show proof of citizenship to vote in state and local ones. the system required registrants to prove their citizenship by providing one of a series of documents, including birth certificates and passports.  kobach has gained a reputation for pushing a series of voting and anti immigration measures as a national debate over voting restrictions has accelerated since the supreme court struck down parts of the voting rights act in 2013.

" the top elected republican, paul ryan, said on thursday he was not ready to endorse donald trump, a sign of the challenges the party’s presumptive presidential nominee faces rallying the republican establishment behind his white house bid. ryan, the speaker of the u.s. house of representatives, said conservatives wanted to know if trump shares their values. “i hope to support our nominee, i hope to support his candidacy fully,” ryan said on cnn. “at this point, i’m just not there right now.” trump, who has built a huge following with an anti establishment message, shot back at ryan in a statement. “i am not ready to support speaker ryan’s agenda. perhaps in the future we can work together and come to an agreement about what is best for the american people,” he said. the republican national committee, under pressure to unify the party or face an electoral rout in the nov. 8 election, said  ryan and trump were expected to meet soon. it added that “only a united republican party will be able to beat hillary clinton.” “we respect speaker ryan’s opinion and believe that since the primary ended early we will have time to unify. we anticipate the two meeting soon to begin to help unite the party,” said rnc spokeswoman lindsay walters. trump’s last remaining rivals in the republican race, u.s. senator ted cruz and ohio governor john kasich, dropped out this week, clearing the new york billionaire’s path to be picked as the presidential nominee. he will likely face clinton, the democratic front runner, in the nov. 8 general election. many republicans have grappled this week with whether to support trump, who has deviated from the party line on trade and upset the party establishment with offensive comments about women and immigrants. trump on thursday announced a new campaign finance chairman in response to questions about his readiness for a general election race. trump, speaking to thousands at a rally in charleston, west virginia, on thursday night, sharpened his criticism of clinton, the kind of tactic that some republican strategists believe will help unify the party. he blasted clinton for saying recently she would impose clean energy policies that would put coal miners out of business. he put on a hard hat presented to him by the state’s coal miners’ association and made a shoveling motion. “and for those miners, get ready: you’re going to be working your asses off,” he said. in a sign some republicans are rallying around trump, nebraska governor pete ricketts, whose family has helped bankroll the anti trump group our principles, is set to endorse trump on friday when the candidate visits omaha. former texas governor rick perry, who ran unsuccessfully for the 2016 nomination, told cnn he now supported trump as well. ryan criticized trump in december for proposing to temporarily ban all muslims from entering the united states and knocked him in march for failing to denounce white supremacist groups during a television interview. the house speaker, who was the running mate of republican 2012 presidential nominee mitt romney, a harsh trump critic, said he hoped the party would be unified by this summer but that the pressure was on trump to do that. “he won fair and square,” ryan said of trump, acknowledging his own policy differences with the new york billionaire businessman. he added: “if we don’t unify all wings of the party, we’re not going to win this election.” ryan repeatedly denied interest in running for president this year despite attempts to draft him by some in his party. he has been putting together a policy plan for house republicans to campaign on, which he says will be released before the convention in july. trump on thursday began shifting focus from the bruising primary campaign to the general election. he has largely used his own money for his primary fight but plans to follow the more typical path of raising money from outside sources for the general election to succeed democratic president barack obama. he named his campaign finance chief on thursday   steven mnuchin, a former goldman sachs partner who is chief executive of private investment firm dune capital management and with whom trump worked in a business capacity in the past. mnuchin has a long history of political donations, including to clinton. since 1998, mnuchin has given about $71,000 to democrats, compared with about $37,000 to republicans. republicans have questioned trump’s loyalty to the party because he also donated to democratic candidates in the past. u.s. representative renee ellmers, a republican from north carolina who has endorsed trump, told reuters the campaign would begin raising money for the party. “they are going to start understanding and realizing that in order to grow this operation, they will need to grow funds, not only for him and for the campaign to beat hillary clinton, but  for the republican party itself,” ellmers said.  historically, political parties have depended on their nominees to raise money in order to fund their other operations, including working to elect members of the house of representatives and senate. one key worry for republicans has been that their candidates for congress and other elective positions could suffer with the divisive figure of trump at the top of the ticket.  ron bonjean, a republican strategist, said ryan gave lawmakers in his party cover to steer clear of trump in their re election campaigns. “he is positioning the republican conference and giving republicans a message they can hold onto,” bonjean said.

" from the moment saad al hariri s plane touched down in saudi arabia on friday nov. 3, he was in for a surprise. there was no line up of saudi princes or ministry officials, as would typically greet a prime minister on an official visit to king salman, senior sources close to hariri and top lebanese political and security officials said. his phone was confiscated, and the next day he was forced to resign as prime minister in a statement broadcast by a saudi owned tv channel. the move thrust lebanon back to the forefront of a struggle that is reshaping the middle east, between the conservative sunni monarchy of saudi arabia and shi ite revolutionary iran. their rivalry has fueled conflicts in iraq, syria and yemen, where they back opposing sides, and now risks destabilizing lebanon, where saudi has long tried to weaken the iran backed hezbollah group, lebanon s main political power and part of the ruling coalition. sources close to hariri say saudi arabia has concluded that the prime minister   a long time saudi ally and son of late prime minister rafik al hariri, who was assassinated in 2005   had to go because he was unwilling to confront hezbollah. multiple lebanese sources say riyadh hopes to replace saad hariri with his older brother bahaa as lebanon s top sunni politician. bahaa is believed to be in saudi arabia and members of the hariri family have been asked to travel there to pledge allegiance to him, but have refused, the sources say.  when hariri s plane landed in riyadh, he got the message immediately that something was wrong,  a hariri source told reuters.  there was no one was waiting for him.   saudi arabia has dismissed suggestions it forced hariri to resign and says he is a free man. saudi officials could not immediately be reached for comment on the circumstances of his arrival, whether his phone had been taken, or whether the kingdom was planning to replace him with his brother. hariri has given no public remarks since he resigned and no indication of when he might return to lebanon. hariri was summoned to the kingdom to meet saudi king salman in a phone call on thursday night, nov. 2. before departing, he told his officials they would resume their discussions on monday. he told his media team he would see them at the weekend in the red sea resort of sharm al sheikh, where he was due to meet egyptian president abdel fattah al sisi on the sidelines of the world youth forum. hariri went to his riyadh home. his family made their fortune in saudi arabia and have long had properties there. the source close to hariri said the lebanese leader received a call from a saudi protocol official on saturday morning, who asked him to attend a meeting with crown prince mohammed bin salman.  he waited for about four hours before being presented with his resignation speech to read on television, the source said.  from the moment he arrived they (saudis) showed no respect for the man,  another senior lebanese political source said. hariri frequently visits saudi arabia. on a trip a few days earlier, prince mohammed bin salman had arranged for him to see senior intelligence officials and gulf affairs minister thamer al sabhan, the saudi point man on lebanon. hariri came back from that trip to beirut  pleased and relaxed , sources in his entourage said. he posted a selfie with sabhan, both of them smiling. he told aides he had heard  encouraging statements  from the crown prince, including a promise to revive a saudi aid package for the lebanese army. the hariri sources say hariri believed he had convinced saudi officials of the need to maintain an entente with hezbollah for the sake of lebanon s stability. hezbollah has a heavily armed fighting force, in addition to seats in parliament and government. saudi backed efforts to weaken the group in lebanon a decade ago led to sunni shi ite clashes and a hezbollah takeover of beirut.   what happened in those meetings, i believe, is that (hariri) revealed his position on how to deal with hezbollah in lebanon: that confrontation would destabilize the country. i think they didn t like what they heard,  said one of the sources, who was briefed on the meetings. the source said hariri told sabhan not to  hold us responsible for something that is beyond my control or that of lebanon.  but hariri underestimated the saudi position on hezbollah, the source said.  for the saudis it is an existential battle. it s black and white. we in lebanon are used to gray,  the source said. sabhan could not immediately be reached for comment. hariri s resignation speech shocked his team. lebanese president michel aoun, a hezbollah ally, told ambassadors to lebanon that saudi arabia had kidnapped hariri, a senior lebanese official said. on friday, france said it wanted hariri to have  all his freedom of movement . in his speech, hariri said he feared assassination and accused iran and hezbollah of sowing strife in the region. he said the arab world would  cut off the hands that wickedly extend to it,  language which one source close to him said was not typical of the lebanese leader. hariri s resignation came as more than 200 people, including 11 saudi princes, current and former ministers and tycoons, were arrested in an anti corruption purge in saudi arabia. initially there was speculation hariri was a target of that

saudi king after his resignation. footage was aired on saudi tv. he was then flown to abu dhabi to meet crown prince mohammed bin zayed, the saudi crown prince s main regional ally. he returned to riyadh and has since received western ambassadors. sources close to hariri said the saudis, while keeping hariri under house arrest, were trying to orchestrate a change of leadership in hariri s future movement by installing his elder brother bahaa, who was overlooked for the top job when their father was killed. the two have been at odds for years. in a statement, the future movement said it stood fully behind hariri as its leader. hariri aide and interior minister nohad machnouk dismissed the idea bahaa was being positioned to replace his brother:  we are not herds of sheep or a plot of land whose ownership can be moved from one person to another. in lebanon things happen though elections not pledges of allegiances.  family members, aides and politicians who have contacted hariri in

" germany s social democrat (spd) foreign minister said on thursday that his party would not be quick to agree to another grand coalition with chancellor angela merkel s conservatives, as party leaders met with the president in a bid to end political deadlock. merkel is casting around for a coalition partner after her center right bloc shed support to the far right in a sept. 24 election. her attempts to form a three way tie up with the pro business free democrats (fdp) and the greens failed. the spd, which saw its participation in a merkel led coalition government from 2013 17 rewarded with its worst election result in german post war history, had been strongly opposed to another  grand coalition . but under pressure from germany s president frank walter steinmeier, spd leader martin schulz has signaled willingness to discuss a way out of the political impasse. spd foreign minister sigmar gabriel told broadcaster zdf no one should expect his party   still ruling with the conservatives in a caretaker government   to immediately agree to join another grand coalition now that talks to form a three way  jamaica  alliance have failed.  we re now in a process orchestrated by the president, in which we first need to look at what the possibilities are but no one can expect it to go quickly,  he said, adding that it was up to the conservatives to show what they wanted.  the conservatives, greens and fdp took months to get nothing off ground so i d ask people not to put pressure on us,  gabriel said, adding that the conservatives needed to make clear what they wanted. senior conservative and chancellery chief peter altmaier told zdf the conservatives and spd had presided over four years of economic prosperity and the spd needed to decide if it would give that up or reconsider its decision to go into opposition.  we re making the case for that because we think one of our trademarks, alongside  made in germany , is  stability made in germany , altmaier said. he added that many people expected germany to manage to form a government, adding:  everyone has to live up to that.  steinmeier, a former spd lawmaker and foreign minister, hosted a meeting on thursday that lasted just over two hours between merkel, her bavarian conservative ally horst seehofer and schulz, as part of his efforts to facilitate the formation of a stable government. the parties are all due to hold high level meetings on friday to discuss how to proceed. sources in the spd said all options would be discussed   ranging from a re run of the grand coalition with the conservatives to new elections.  merkel is set to hold a telephone conference with senior party members on friday to discuss the meeting with steinmeier but the conservatives do not expect the spd to agree to official coalition talks until after its party congress next week. almost two thirds of germans, surveyed between nov.22 and nov.27, want the spd to start talks with the conservatives on forming another coalition of the center right and center left, an allensbach poll showed. the atmosphere has been soured by the decision of the conservative agriculture minister to back a european union proposal to extend the use of a weedkiller for another five years   a measure opposed by the spd. in reaction, spd members have called for compensation and set various policy conditions. german interior minister thomas de maiziere, a conservative, told reporters a stable government was urgently needed to move ahead on security priorities such as hiring more police.  he told the frankfurter allgemeine newspaper that the conservatives were trying to form a stable government with the spd, if the spd would agree. he added:  only if this attempt fails do we need to think about other steps   not now.  fdp leader christian lindner, who walked out of attempts to form the  jamaica  alliance, told newspaper rheinische post a grand coalition would be  more stable and more advantageous  than a jamaica tie up.the business wing of merkel s christian democrats called on merkel to  seriously consider  a minority government, warning that another grand coalition would only be possible for the price of  even more unaffordable promises  in social policy.

" argentina s main labor unions took to the streets of the capital on tuesday demanding more jobs and protesting center right president mauricio macri s economic policies.  tens of thousands of workers gathered in the historic plaza de mayo criticizing macri, who is trying to lower labor costs to attract investment and jump start an economy that emerged from recession in the second half of last year.  if some retrograde (in the government) thinks that lowering wages, precarious living conditions and destroying trade unions is going to line up investments... we say that is very wrong,  said juan carlos schmid, a leader of argentina s largest umbrella union, the cgt. standing on a podium at the protest, he said the cgt would meet in late september to discuss a potential strike.  macri told reuters in an interview this month his government was negotiating labor agreements sector by sector rather than trying to pass a comprehensive labor reform like the one approved in neighboring brazil. unions fear more drastic changes could be coming after mid term legislative elections in october, however, especially after a primary vote on aug. 13 pointed to strong support for macri s coalition. macri is trying to open argentina s long protected economy and focus on competitive industries like oil and agriculture, but has seen some manufacturing jobs lost in the meantime.  the most recent employment data showed the jobless rate rose to 9.2 percent in the first quarter of the year from 7.6 percent in the fourth quarter of last year.

" u.s. president donald trump headed to japan on the first stop of his five nation tour of asia on saturday, looking to present a united front with the japanese against north korea as tensions run high over pyongyang s nuclear and missile tests. trump, who is on a 12 day trip, is to speak to u.s. and japanese forces at yokota air base shortly after arriving in japan on sunday and looked to stress the importance of the alliance to regional security. ballistic missile tests by north korea and its sixth and largest nuclear test, in defiance of u.n. security council resolutions, have exacerbated the most critical international challenge of trump s presidency. aerial drills conducted over south korea by two u.s. strategic bombers have raised tensions in recent days. in a display of golf diplomacy, trump is to play a round of golf with japanese prime minister shinzo abe. the two leaders also played together in florida earlier this year. trump will also have a state call with the imperial family at akasaka palace during his visit. abe and trump will meet families of japanese citizens abducted by north korea. joined by his wife melania on part of the trip, trump s tour of asia is the longest by an american president since george h.w. bush in 1992. besides japan, he will visit south korea, china, vietnam and the philippines. trump departed hawaii for japan aboard air force one shortly before 7:27 a.m. hawaii time (1727 gmt). en route to hawaii s hickham air force base, trump s motorcade stopped briefly at the trump international hotel waikiki.  it has been a tremendously successful project and he wanted to say hello and thank you to the employees for all their hard work,  white house spokeswoman sarah sanders said.  trump extended the trip by a day on friday when he agreed to participate in a summit of east asian nations in manila. his trip got off to a colorful start in hawaii. he was taken by boat out to the uss arizona memorial, where lies the world war two ship that was sunk by the japanese during the pearl harbor attack in 1941. the trumps tossed white flower petals into the waters at the memorial in honor of those who died at pearl harbor.  trump s trip is to be dominated by trade and how to muster more international pressure on north korea to give up nuclear weapons.  we ll be talking about trade,  trump told reporters at the white house on friday.  we ll be talking about obviously north korea. we ll be enlisting the help of a lot of people and countries and we ll see what happens. but i think we re going to have a very successful trip. there is a lot of good will.  trump has rattled some allies with his vow to  totally destroy  north korea if it threatens the united states and his dismissal of north korean leader kim jong un as a  rocket man  on a suicide mission. white house national security adviser h.r. mcmaster, briefing reporters on friday, defended trump s colorful language.  what s inflammatory is the north korean regime and what they re doing to threaten the world,  mcmaster said. trump will seek a united front with the leaders of japan and south korea against north korea before visiting beijing to make the case to chinese president xi jinping that he should do more to rein in pyongyang. trade will factor heavily during trump s trip as he tries to persuade asian allies to agree to trade policies more favorable to the united states. a centerpiece of the trip will be a visit to the asia pacific economic cooperation summit in danang, vietnam, where he will deliver a speech in support of a free and open indo pacific region, which is seen as offering a bulwark in response to expansionist chinese policies.

" cuba and the united states will draw up a roadmap for deepening their detente on wednesday in a first meeting since the election of donald trump as u.s. president and the death of cuban revolutionary fidel castro. the fifth u.s. cuban bilateral commission comes at a time of increased uncertainty about the future of u.s. cuban relations given trump’s promise to end the detente if cuba did not offer a better “deal.” the administration of outgoing u.s. president barack obama has pressed american companies to complete additional business deals in cuba to help further cement the president’s policy by the time trump takes office on january 20. “we will define the actions that will be carried out in the coming weeks to further the process of improving relations,” the cuban foreign ministry said on tuesday. those actions would include high level visits and accords of cooperation in areas of mutual interest, it said. communist ruled cuba has so far mostly stayed quiet on trump’s statements, waiting to see whether he converts his tough rhetoric into policy change. several major u.s. companies, such as general electric, are in the final stages of negotiating deals with cuba, sources familiar with the matter say. one of those sources, based in washington, said more than half a dozen announcements, ranging from cruise ships and travel to manufacturing and telecommunications, are believed to be in the works. negotiations may have been affected by the nine days of official mourning for castro, the source said. castro had given cuba an outsized influence in world affairs during his half century as president, partly by clashing with the united states.  his younger brother, raul castro, who took over as president in 2008, made history two years ago by agreeing with obama to end cold war hostility and start normalizing relations.  since then, the two countries have opened embassies, restored commercial flights, opened travel options and negotiated agreements on issues affecting the environment, law enforcement, the postal service and communications. obama, who visited cuba earlier this year, has also gradually poked holes in the u.s. embargo on the caribbean island through executive orders. but trump says obama ought to have cut a “better deal.” at a campaign rally in miami, which has a large population of cuban exiles, he said he would seek to reverse obama’s moves to open relations with cuba unless its leaders allowed religious freedoms and freed political prisoners. u.s. supporters of the detente say it is improving cubans’ lives while contributing to opening the socialist system in place, for example by fostering the fledgling private sector. a bipartisan group of u.s. congressional leaders and four cuban entrepreneurs will hold a joint news conference on wednesday to urge congress to lift the u.s. embargo on cuba. the cuban entrepreneurs will also urge trump not to reverse the thaw, according to a statement issued by the office of pro detente senator patrick leahy.

" the top executive at the company behind the embattled dakota access pipeline has donated more than $100,000 to republican presidential candidate donald trump since june, according to campaign finance disclosure records. the donations by kelcy warren, chairman and chief executive officer at pipeline operator energy transfer partners, support the candidate seen by many as more likely to promote the u.s. oil and gas industry than his opponent, democrat hillary clinton. warren donated $300 to the trump campaign during the primaries, and $2,700 to trump during the general election phase of the campaign, for the maximum contribution allowed by a single individual during an election.  he also gave $100,000 to the trump victory fund, a joint fundraising committee that includes the trump campaign, the republican national committee, the republican party of arkansas and the connecticut republican party.  the donations, first reported by the british newspaper the guardian, were made before the u.s. government halted construction on a segment of energy transfer partners’ 1,100 mile (1,770 km) dakota access pipeline in early september following protests by native american and environmental groups.  the project, which would move oil from the highly productive bakken shale formation to the midwest and gulf coast, sparked violent clashes between security officers near the construction site and native american tribe members and other protesters. opponents have said the project will damage burial sites considered sacred to the standing rock sioux tribe and pollute the area’s drinking water.  warren has also given $66,800 to the republication national committee since trump secured the nomination for the nov. 8 election, the guardian reported. trump has not yet taken a position on the dakota access pipeline, but supports the development of oil and gas and related infrastructure, including pipelines. asked about trump’s position on the dakota access pipeline in a policy debate this week, u.s. representative kevin cramer of north dakota, one of the candidate’s main energy advisers, declined to answer, saying he did not want to get ahead of trump. he added, “i’m not sure he (trump) is aware of it.”  if elected, trump in his first 100 days will ask transcanada to renew its permit application for the keystone xl pipeline, according to his campaign website. u.s. president barack obama rejected the proposed pipeline from canada last november. trump has holdings in energy transfer partners and phillips 66, a joint owner of the dakota access pipeline, through mutual funds, according to financial disclosure records. u.s. oil and gas industry workers have contributed slightly more to clinton, with employees giving $114,141 to the democratic candidate and $99,302 to trump since july, according to a reuters review of federal campaign finance disclosures.

" the pentagon on tuesday proposed a $582.7 billion defense budget that emphasizes emerging threats from russia, china and islamic state rebels, but the plan is already under fire from republican lawmakers who charge it short changes the u.s. military. president barack obama’s last budget would boost spending on the war against islamic state militants to $7.5 billion during the 2017 fiscal year, a 50 percent jump over the $5 billion approved this year. some $200 million of that would go to fight militants in north and west africa. the proposal also would quadruple funds to counter russian pressure in europe, including its seizure of ukraine’s crimean peninsula and repeated strategic bomber flights near nato air space. spending to boost u.s. military presence and training in europe would rise to $3.4 billion from $800 million this year. the budget heralds a strategic shift as washington looks beyond the wars in iraq and afghanistan and enters a new period of great power competition from russia and china as well as threats from smaller rivals like iran and north korea, officials said. “this budget marks a major inflection point for the department of defense,” defense secretary ash carter said in a statement. “even as we fight today’s fights, we must also be prepared for the fights that might come in 10, 20 or 30 years.” overall, the administration is seeking a pentagon base budget of $523.9 billion for the fiscal year beginning oct. 1, plus $58.8 billion for war funding and overseas operations. the base budget is about $2.5 billion more than this year’s while war spending remains relatively flat, officials said. the spending proposal is in line with a congressional budget deal last year that set pentagon funding guidelines for 2016 and 2017. but republican lawmakers have criticized the war funding plan, saying the $59 billion figure in the budget deal was a floor, not a ceiling, and the president should have sought more. “this request is inadequate to address the national security threats we face,” senator john mccain, chairman of the senate armed services committee, said in a statement. congressman mac thornberry, chairman of the house armed services committee, accused the administration of playing “budgetary games.” mccain said by seeking the minimum level of war funding in the budget deal, the president had left the pentagon with $17 billion less than it estimated it would need for 2017 in last year’s budget. to make up the shortfall in planned spending, the pentagon cut more than $5 billion by adjusting its assumptions about expected fuel costs and inflation levels, pentagon comptroller mike mccord said. it also cut procurement to $112.1 billion, down 6 percent, from this year. the reductions would come mainly from planned aircraft purchases, including five fewer f 35 joint strike fighters (lmt.n) and a reduction in several types of army helicopters(ba.n), budget documents show.  while cutting procurement, the pentagon proposed increasing spending on research and development by 4 percent, to $71.8 billion, as it looks to develop new technologies to give it a military edge. the department said it would spend $16.8 billion in its classified military intelligence accounts.  it also agreed to delay until 2022 its controversial plan to retire the a 10 close air support aircraft, which is being used in the fight against islamic state. retaining the aircraft will cost $3.4 billion over the five year period. the budget would continue to shrink the size of the u.s. army, which will drop to 460,000 soldiers in 2017 from the current 475,000. separately, the president’s budget would fund a new $150 million polar icebreaker vessel to ensure year round accessibility to the arctic for coast guard missions.

" the dark vision of america under siege described by donald trump in his acceptance speech for the republican presidential nomination does not mesh with reality, u.s. president barack obama said on friday. obama noted that the “birds were chirping and the sun was out” for most americans after trump’s thursday night speech, which expounded on the threats to america from illegal immigrants, islamic state militants, and race related violence. “this idea that america is somehow on the verge of collapse, this vision of violence and chaos everywhere, doesn’t really jibe with the experience of most people,” obama said at a white house news conference after meeting with mexican president enrique pena nieto. obama said the violent crime rate in america has been lower during his 7 1/2 years in office than any time during the last three or four decades, despite an “uptick” in murders in some cities this year, and the recent high profile killings of black men and police officers. the timing of obama’s quickly arranged short meeting with pena nieto presented both leaders with a convenient platform from which to criticize trump. just three weeks ago, obama   who has six months left in the white house   invited the mexican president to visit one last time before the u.s. president leaves on jan. 20. trump has pledged to build a wall at the mexico border to keep out illegal immigrants and drugs, and to force mexico to pay for it. the new york businessman has also promised to slap tariffs on some u.s. products made in mexico, and seek radical changes or even discard the north american free trade agreement (nafta) between the united states, mexico and canada. pena nieto was first to mention trump, but said he respected both trump and presumptive democratic presidential nominee hillary clinton, and would work with constructively and in good faith with whoever wins the nov. 8 election. in march, pena nieto likened trump’s “strident tone” to the ascent of dictators adolf hitler and benito mussolini. but he said on friday that he had never pointed the finger at any of the candidates, saying that anything he had said had been taken out of context. and he stressed that the two nations’ futures were closely bound. “the closeness between the united states and mexico is more than a relationship between governments. it’s a solid and unbreakable relationship between millions of people who live in both nations,” pena nieto said. obama said the rate of illegal immigration is down from past decades, and praised mexico for helping to address a flood of migrants fleeing central america and for work on drug trafficking. “a mexico that has a healthy economy, a mexico that can help us build stability and security in central america, that’s going to do a lot more to solve any migration crisis or drug trafficking problem than a wall,” obama said. obama and pena nieto praised the 12 nation trans pacific partnership (tpp) trade deal as addressing some of the criticisms of nafta. both trump and clinton have said they oppose the tpp, which has yet to be ratified by the u.s. congress. “there are going to be different visions about where we should go as a country,” obama said, running down a list of economic issues facing the nation. “but we’re not going to make good decisions based on fears that don’t have a basis in fact,” he said.

" norway s liberal party will launch formal negotiations to join the right wing cabinet of prime minister erna solberg, it said on saturday, although the government would still be ruling in a minority even if the small centrist group is included. informal talks have taken place since the government won re election in september, and bringing in the liberals could give a boost to policies favoring small businesses, the environment and education.  we are going to give ourselves a chance ... to find a common platform we can agree on,  liberal party leader trine skei grande told a meeting of her party in parliament on saturday, adding it would be a  challenging and difficult  process. adding the liberals to the coalition of the conservatives and the anti immigration progress party could make day to day governing easier for solberg, although she would still require backing from another small party, the christian democrats. the prime minister has sought to include both of the small centrist groups, but the christian democrats, which back solberg on fiscal matters, have rejected the offer.

" u.s. secretary of state rex tillerson has authorized the state department to notify congress of the trump administration’s sale of precision guided munitions for saudi arabia to use in its yemen campaign, a senior u.s. diplomat said on tuesday. the notification is one of the last steps in the arms sale process and triggers a formal 30 day review to allow members of congress to attempt to pass legislation to stop any sale. u.s. lawmakers introduced legislation last week seeking to block about $500 million of a $110 billion arms sale to saudi arabia, including the portion on precision guided missiles and other offensive weapons. an announcement of the sale had been expected in march but objections from mostly democratic lawmakers and human rights groups led to washington to ask riyadh for commitments to improve targeting procedures that would minimize civilian casualties. asked on tuesday whether the saudis had taken specific measures to improve targeting capabilities, the senior u.s. diplomat, acting assistant secretary of state for near eastern affairs stuart jones, did not answer directly. “that’s a continuing source of conversation between us,” jones told reporters. “we’re constantly trying to improve that process.” the yemen civil war pits iran allied houthi rebels against the government backed by a saudi led arab coalition. nearly 4,800 civilians have been killed since march 2015, the united nations said in march. jones said tillerson’s authorization, which was expected, occurred just before president donald trump’s may 20 21 visit to saudi arabia. trump’s predecessor, barack obama, in december limited military support to saudi arabia’s campaign in yemen because of concerns over civilian casualties, and halted the sale of the precision guided munitions. on his trip to saudi arabia, trump received a warm welcome from gulf arab leaders, who want to crack down on iran’s influence in the region, a commitment they found lacking in obama. trump also did not make overt mentions of human rights abuses in saudi arabia in his speech there, a move criticized by democrats and republicans in congress. “the fact that it wasn’t featured in the speech doesn’t mean that it’s not part of the bilateral dialogue,” jones said. “by taking it out of the public debate and having those conversations directly and quietly, we’ll be more effective.” tillerson last week told reporters that human rights issues were not the “central part” of trump’s private meetings with  saudi officials, which instead focused on the fight against terrorism.

" indonesian police have arrested an australian, an american and a malaysian on the holiday island of bali for drugs offences, the latest foreigners to run afoul of some of the world s strictest laws against narcotics. the three men, who were arrested in separate cases, appeared before the media at a briefing, dressed in orange prison garb, their faces concealed by balaclava, with armed police officers standing guard. it was not immediately clear if any of the three, who were identified only by their initials, would face the death penalty if convicted. authorities found methamphetamine and the party drug ecstasy hidden in a plastic bottle and another container in the luggage of the australian after he arrived on a flight from bangkok on monday, the customs office said.  based on the results of the inspection, our officers found five packages containing clear crystals weighing 19.97 grams and 14 tablets weighing a total of 6.22 grams,  bali airport customs office chief himawan indrajono said in the statement. australia s department of foreign affairs and trade said it was  providing consular assistance to an australian man detained in bali  in response to emailed questions on the arrest. it declined to comment further.  the u.s. citizen was arrested at a bali post office on nov. 30 in connection with a package sent from the united states containing 336.6 grams of e cigarette liquid containing thc, or tetrahydrocannabinol, the active ingredient in cannabis. the malaysian was arrested on nov. 8 after being found with 3.03 grams of leaves thought to be marijuana and 0.65 grams of a white powder suspected to be narcotics, idrajono said. possession of small amounts of drugs can incur lengthy jail sentences in indonesia and larger amounts can result in a death sentence. the execution by firing squad of two australians in 2015, along with six other drug convicts from several other countries, strained relations between jakarta and canberra. indonesia says it is facing a drug crisis with an estimated  6.4 million drug users in the country of 250 million people, and needs to impose tough punishments to contained the problem. president joko widodo has called for a  merciless  crackdown on narcotics, and told law enforcers to shoot drug traffickers if they resisted arrest. that echoes a tough stand taken by philippine leader rodrigo duterte who has ordered a war against drugs in which several thousand people have been killed since mid 2016.

" the syrian opposition applauded a u.s. cruise missile attack on an airbase near homs on friday but said it must not be a one off and was not enough on its own to stop government warplanes from hitting rebel held areas. the syrian opposition has long criticized the united states for failing to protect rebel held areas from government air strikes, demanding the creation of a no fly zone or the provision of anti aircraft weapons to rebel groups. u.s. president donald trump’s decision to launch missiles at the airbase, from which he said a deadly chemical weapons attack had been launched, marked a dramatic departure from the more cautious approach of his predecessor barack obama. it was welcomed by opposition officials, but they called for more.  “one airbase is not enough. there are 26 airbases that target civilians,” tweeted mohammad alloush, a senior rebel official. george sabra, a prominent opposition politician, told al hadath tv: “the truth is that militarily, if it is limited to this strike, then it has no meaning.” the free syrian army, a loose alliance of rebel groups that includes factions that have received military support from the united states, called the u.s. strike the “correct starting point” for finding a “just political solution” to the war “we view that the responsibility of the united states is still great, and does not stop with this operation,” it added in a statement, warning that the damascus government and its allies could commit “acts of revenge” against civilians. american officials described the attack   the first direct u.s. assault on the government of president bashar al assad in six years of civil war   as a one off that would not lead to wider escalation. syrian officials and their allies also said they did not expect the attack to lead to an expansion of the conflict. the strikes targeted the base at shayrat, 40 km (25 miles) southeast of homs city, from which washington and syrian opposition groups say syrian warplanes launched a chemical weapons attack on the town of khan sheikhoun this week. the syrian government has strongly denied responsibility and says it does not use chemical weapons. the homs governor said on friday the base was being used to provide air support for operations against islamic state east of palmyra. hassan haj ali, commander of the free idlib army rebel group, which fights under the fsa umbrella, told reuters the strikes came at a “very important phase” and showed syrians that “there is still humanity in this world”. he said he did not expect further such u.s. attacks, however. nasr al hariri, chief negotiator of the high negotiations committee (hnc), said on twitter that the strikes “should they continue, would kick off a correct start in combating terrorism”.   the saudi based hnc, the main opposition body which includes political and armed groups, has participated in u.n. sponsored peace talks in geneva. “we hope for the continuation of the strikes in order to prevent the regime from using its planes to launch any new air raids or going back to using internationally banned weapons,” said ahmad ramadan, head of the media office of the syrian national coalition political opposition group.  “the airbase targeted by the u.s. strike was used to kill syrians,” ramadan said. the american attack “sends a clear message to the regime and its backers” that they can no longer avoid repercussions, he added.

" as americans began signing up for obamacare health insurance plans on wednesday, experts expected reduced participation as a bitter political debate clouds the program’s future.      republicans in congress have repeatedly failed to repeal and replace former president barack obama’s healthcare law, which they have said drives up costs for consumers and interferes with personal medical decisions. democrats have warned that repeal would leave millions of americans without health coverage.  president donald trump promised to kill obama’s affordable care act in his 2016 election campaign, and has taken steps to undermine a law he has declared “dead” and “imploding”. trump’s administration cut obamacare advertising by 90 percent and shortened the enrollment period by half.  “the market’s going to be extremely confusing. there’s going to be entire complexity of choice,” said david anderson, a health policy researcher at duke university.  obama took to social media on wednesday, encouraging americans who need insurance to sign up on the federal healthcare.gov website. he stressed that government tax credits would keep coverage affordable for most.  obama asked people to get out the word, “because this country works best when we look out for one another.” a new trump ad, paid for by the republican national committee, blamed democrats for obamacare’s “skyrocketing” insurance premiums and for blocking efforts to repeal the law.      obamacare advocates have warned that sign ups for individual insurance coverage under the law could drop by about one million people in 2018 compared with 2017. the nonpartisan congressional budget office estimates that four million fewer people will sign up for obamacare private insurance than previously forecast due to trump policies.  still, cbo expects total enrollment to reach 11 million in 2018, up from the around 10 million who obtained and paid for coverage in 2017. administration officials could not immediately say when 2018 enrollment data would be made public.  the trump administration has cut the 2018 enrollment period in half to six weeks from nov. 1 to dec. 15 for states using the federal healthcare.gov website. enrollment previously ran until jan. 31, and many consumers tended to sign up in the last two weeks, according to state officials and organizations that help people choose insurance. the administration has also cut off billions of dollars in subsidies that insurers use to discount out of pocket medical costs for low income americans and cut funding to groups that help people enroll in health insurance.  several insurers have exited obamacare markets due to concerns over subsidies and other trump actions. those that remained raised monthly premium prices to account for the lost government subsidies. senate republicans and democrats are working on legislation to stabilize obamacare markets in the short term, including restoring the subsidies. but trump has sought more far reaching changes, and urged republicans to take up full scale repeal again in the coming months.      the department of health and human services said on monday that premiums for the most popular obamacare plans would rise 37 percent in 2018. americans eligible for obamacare tax credits to buy insurance may pay less for coverage, but middle class consumers who do not get subsidies will face much higher prices for these plans. “it’s been such a flood of information. a lot of the population thinks the affordable care act has already been put under,” said daniel polsky, a professor at the university of pennsylvania and executive director of the leonard davis institute of health economics. “the strange premium increases are going to be very confusing for consumers.” the trump administration is now planning changes for 2019. last week, it proposed a rule giving states more flexibility over the benefits that must be covered by insurance. under obamacare, all insurers have to cover a set of 10 benefits, such as maternity and newborn care and prescription drugs.

" lebanon has set a date of may 6 next year to hold its first legislative election in nearly a decade, potentially transforming the politics of a country caught in a confrontation between saudi arabia and iran. interior minister nohad machnouk signed a decree setting the date on friday, allowing the vote to go ahead at last. the election has been postponed three times since the last vote in 2009, with politicians citing security concerns, political crisis and a dispute over the election law. prime minister saad al hariri s coalition government, which took office a year ago, agreed on the new election law in june, but setting the date was held up while officials debated technical details and registered lebanese citizens abroad. lebanon s political landscape has shifted dramatically since the last election. hariri s pro western, saudi backed political alliance has split up. for the past year he has led a power sharing government which includes the heavily armed, iran backed shi ite movement hezbollah, despised by his saudi allies. hariri sparked a political crisis last month by announcing his resignation while in riyadh and denouncing hezbollah and iran. he stayed abroad for two weeks before returning, and finally withdrew his resignation last week. lebanon has a complex electoral system designed to maintain civil peace in a country where sunnis, shi ites, christians and druze fought numerous civil wars since independence in 1943. the 128 seat parliament includes 64 christians apportioned among seven denominations, and 64 muslims, including equal numbers of sunnis and shi ites. the country is divided into districts that each vote for multiple lawmakers according to strict religious quotas. the president must be a maronite christian, the prime minister a sunni muslim and the parliament speaker a shi ite muslim, representing the three biggest groups in parliament. the international community has repeatedly stressed the importance of lebanon holding timely elections to restore confidence in its institutions and maintain stability. machnouk said lebanese abroad would be able to vote on april 22 and 28.

" china called for a ceasefire in myanmar s rakhine state so that rohingya muslim refugees can return from bangladesh, proposing a  three stage approach to the crisis as diplomats from 51 mostly asian and european countries gathered in myanmar on monday. more than 600,000 muslim rohingya have fled to bangladesh since late august, driven out by a military clearance operation in buddhist majority myanmar s rakhine state. amid a burgeoning humanitarian catastrophe, rights groups have accused the myanmar military of atrocities, while foreign critics have blasted aung san suu kyi, the nobel peace prize winner who leads a civilian administration that is less than two years old, for failing to speak out more strongly. on monday, suu kyi opened an asia europe meeting for foreign ministers that had been scheduled in myanmar before the outbreak of the crisis. speaking in the capital of naypyitaw on sunday, having arrived from dhaka, china s foreign minister wang yi said china believed myanmar and bangladesh could work out a mutually acceptable way to end the crisis.  the first phase is to effect a ceasefire on the ground, to return to stability and order, so the people can enjoy peace and no longer be forced to flee,  china s foreign ministry said in a statement, citing wang.  with the hard work of all sides, at present, the first phase s aim has already basically been achieved, and the key is to prevent a flare up, especially that there is no rekindling the flames of war.  during a meeting on sunday, the ministry said, wang told myanmar president htin kyaw,  as a friend of both myanmar and bangladesh, china is willing to keep playing a constructive role for the appropriate handling of the rakhine state issue.   visiting myanmar last week, u.s. secretary of state rex tillerson made many of the same points, but he also called for a credible investigation into reports of atrocities. once a ceasefire is seen to be working, wang said talks between myanmar and bangladesh should find a workable solution for the return of refugees, and the final phase should be to work toward a long term solution based on poverty alleviation. myanmar and bangladesh officials began talks last month to settle a repatriation process for rohingya refugees, which bangladesh expects to take to the next level in coming days. speaking on the sidelines of the asem meeting, european union foreign policy chief federica mogherini said,  we believe that stopping the violence, the flow of refugees and guaranteeing full humanitarian access to rakhine state, and safe, sustainable repatriation of refugees are going to be key.  mogherini, who also visited bangladesh over the weekend, said,  there s a real possibility of myanmar and bangladesh reaching a memorandum of understanding and agreement for the safe repatriation of refugees to myanmar.  the european bloc was ready to help with the process, she added. it was unclear, however, whether a safe return was possible, or advisable, for the thousands of rohingya women and children still stranded on the beaches trying to flee hunger and instability in rakhine. myanmar intends to resettle most refugees who return in new  model villages , rather than on the land they previously occupied, an approach the united nations has criticized in the past as effectively creating permanent camps. besides restoring peace for rohingya to return, myanmar also had to resolve the issue of their citizenship, having treated them as stateless for decades, the u.n. high commissioner for refugees, filippo grandi, told a news conference in tokyo. the unhcr was ready to assist both countries with repatriation, he said, adding that it could help myanmar with the citizenship verification of the rohingya. until now it has not been invited to participate in either.  much as resources are needed in bangladesh to respond to the crisis, the solutions to this crisis lie in myanmar,  grandi said. the crisis erupted after the military launched a brutal counter insurgency operation against the militants after attacks on an army base and 30 police posts in rakhine on aug. 25. myanmar s military has said that all fighting against the rohingya militants died out on sept.5. the group behind those attacks, arakan rohingya salvation army (arsa), had declared a one month ceasefire on sept.10, which was rejected by the myanmar government. but there have been no serious clashes since. the united states and other western countries have become more engaged with myanmar since it began a transition to civilian government after nearly 50 years of military rule. myanmar s generals retain autonomy over defense, internal security and border issues in the current power sharing arrangement. china, with close ties to both myanmar and bangladesh, has long been a key player in lawless borderlands where rebel ethnic groups have battled myanmar s government for decades in a conflict driving thousands of refugees to seek shelter in china.

" south african president jacob zuma on tuesday asked the high court to set aside a report by the anti corruption watchdog on alleged influence peddling in his government, saying he would instead set up a commission of inquiry into the allegations. the court has been hearing a case brought by zuma who had challenged the right of the report s author, south africa s anti graft agency known as public protector, to call for a judicial inquiry to investigate the allegations.  zuma, 75, who previously described the  state of capture  report as  unfair  in parliament, said setting up such an inquiry was his prerogative. the report published a year ago recommended a judicial investigation into allegations of systemic corruption by zuma, some of his ministers and heads of state owned companies. the report focused on allegations that zuma s friends, the businessmen and brothers ajay, atul and rajesh gupta, had influenced the appointment of ministers. zuma and the guptas have denied the accusations. in a fresh application on tuesday, zuma s lawyers argued that the entire report by former public protector head thuli madonsela should be set aside.  should the court grant his application, zuma would set up a separate commission of inquiry himself within 30 days of the date of the order, court papers presented by his lawyers said. the main opposition democratic alliance party opposes zuma s application, saying it is unconstitutional. it says it wants the court to support madonsela s recommendation for a judicial inquiry.

" republicans mostly blame the u.s. congress, and not president donald trump or party leaders, for failing to pass their party’s healthcare overhaul, according to a reuters/ipsos opinion poll released on wednesday.  the march 25 28 poll asked who should take responsibility for the failure of the american health care act (ahca), which republican leaders pulled from consideration last week without a vote.  besides trump, who backed the bill, and house of representatives speaker paul ryan, who was expected to shepherd it through congress, the poll asked if people blamed house republicans, house democrats or the media.  republicans were most likely to blame congress. some 26 percent said house democrats were most responsible and 23 percent blamed house republicans. another 13 percent blamed trump and 10 percent blamed ryan. only 8 percent blamed the media.   their assessment appeared to align with trump’s criticism of democratic leaders and the conservative freedom caucus, whom he blamed for the bill’s failure.  overall, nearly one in four americans, including democrats and independents, blamed trump. ryan, congress and the media received less criticism.  the republican reform was widely criticized after estimates by the non partisan congressional budget office showed 24 million people could lose their health insurance over the next 10 years.  trump said on tuesday he still thinks healthcare reform can happen “very quickly” in washington, but he did not offer any specifics on how it could get done, or what would be changed from the previous bill.  nearly half of all americans said they would like to see that happen, though the response was split along party lines. some 80 percent of republicans said they would like to see their party take another swing at a bill, compared with only 25 percent of democrats.  in a separate poll conducted between jan.7 23, 46 percent of americans wanted to keep obamacare, the popular name for president barack obama’s healthcare reform, while fixing “problem areas,” and another 8 percent wanted to keep it exactly as it is.  the reuters/ipsos poll was conducted online in english in all 50 states. the march 25 28 poll included 1,332 people, including 456 republicans and 558 democrats. it has a credibility interval, a measure of accuracy, of 3 percentage points for the entire group and 5 percentage points for democrats and republicans.   (reporting by chris kahn, editing by ross colvin)  ",0

" the united nations has verified 5,144 civilian deaths in the war in yemen, mainly from air strikes by a saudi led coalition, and an international investigation is urgently needed, u.n. human rights chief zeid ra ad al hussein said on monday.   the minimal efforts made toward accountability over the past year are insufficient to respond to the gravity of the continuing and daily violations involved in this conflict,  zeid said in a speech to the u.n. human rights council in geneva.  the devastation of yemen and the horrific suffering of its people will have immense and enduring repercussions across the region.   it is the third time that he has appealed for an international inquiry into human rights violations in yemen where a two year conflict pits the saudi backed yemen government against iran supported houthi rebels. last week zeid s office said the 47 countries on the human rights council were not taking their responsibilities seriously, and urged them to probe the  entirely man made catastrophe . the u.n. says the civil war has created the world s biggest humanitarian crisis, with the conflict compounded by an economic collapse that has pushed millions to the brink of famine. the crippling of the health and sanitation systems has enabled cholera to take hold with unprecedented speed, with about 650,000 people infected since late april, five times the global cholera caseload in 2016. during the three week u.n. human rights council session, saudi arabia and the netherlands are expected to propose rival resolutions, inviting the council to continue backing yemen s national human rights probe or to set up its own inquiry. for the past two years, saudi arabia has prevailed, but the situation in the country has not improved, and zeid s office has said yemen s national investigation is not up to the job. the draft dutch resolution backs zeid s position, a western diplomat said.   the common assessment is that the situation has deteriorated. the compromise that was put in place last year hasn t delivered,  the diplomat said.  one of the resolutions will need to be dismissed.

" new zealand prime minister jacinda ardern said on thursday she will seek to renegotiate the trans pacific partnership (tpp) agreement in vietnam in two weeks  time to allow the government to ban foreign speculators buying new zealand existing homes. ardern, who was sworn in on thursday after negotiating a labour led coalition after a tight election result, said she had already started work on the restrictions.  whether it s tpp or any other agreement it s making sure we have the ability to ban foreign buyers from buying existing homes in new zealand,  ardern told reporters in wellington. the 11 tpp members had set a goal of reaching broad agreement on the pact in november at an asia pacific economic cooperation meeting set to be held in vietnam s danang. new zealand previously touted itself as a champion of free trade and was a key backer of the tpp since the united states withdrew in january, but labour has expressed concern tpp would stop it from banning foreigners from buying existing homes. foreign investors can still buy new houses and apartments. the policy is designed to combat a politically sensitive housing crunch that has priced many new zealanders out of the market, with prices up more than 50 percent nationally in the last decade. in the city of auckland, prices have almost doubled in that period. new zealand was the sixth most popular market for chinese investors, down from fifth last year, said jane lu, head of australia and new zealand for international property website juwai.com. she said foreign buyers tended to fast forward plans to purchase overseas when new restrictions or taxes loomed. while voters have taken to their charismatic 37 year old leader, traders have been less impressed with the government s planned protectionist policies and coalition government. the currency had fallen to $0.6861 on wednesday, its lowest level since may, having plummeted more than 6 percent since the sept. 23 election. the kiwi last stood at $0.6878. veteran protectionist politician winston peters, the leader of new zealand first which holds the balance of power, delivered a victory to labour after the 23 sept. election failed to result in a majority for labour or national. peters last year described a chinese company taking a majority ownership in a small new zealand dairy processor as  lunacy , while he called dairy giant fonterra s decision to send cows to china  economic treason . his policies have consistently centered around tight controls on immigration and foreign investment. as well as renegotiating the tpp, ardern said on thursday that immigration numbers would be cut by up to 30,000 from record levels of over 70,000. any trade and foreign ownership restrictions could hurt new zealand s reputation as an open economy and antagonize the likes of china. trade between the two countries has grown to more than nz$20 billion ($14.4 billion) a year, and chinese president xi jinping called the relationship  unprecedented  in its depth.

" a prominent illinois republican has resigned from the state legislature, citing multiple incidents of fake facebook and twitter accounts set up in his name in recent weeks.  “after some cyber security issues arose, i began to re evaluate my continued public service,” representative ron sandack, house republican floor leader, said in a resignation letter dated sunday and provided on monday by the republican caucus. sandack, known as an adamant defender of republican governor bruce rauner’s initiatives on the floor of the democratic dominated house, was up for re election in november against democrat greg hose. his resignation comes as both major u.s. political parties are increasingly bedeviled by hacking, including friday’s leak of emails that have embarrassed democrats as they gather for the party’s convention in philadelphia this week. sandack had been battling since july 4 to remove multiple fake facebook and twitter accounts in his name, he told capitol fax, a respected political blog based in springfield, the state capital. it is not clear what, if anything, the fake accounts posted in his name. sandack, who was an active user of social media, has shut down his facebook and twitter accounts and has filed a police report regarding the fake ones, capitol fax reported. a spokeswoman for jim durkin, leader of the house republicans, did not respond to a question on who would replace sandack as republican candidate for his seat. rauner did not respond to reporters’ questions about sandack following an event on monday morning.  sandack is a chicago lawyer and former mayor of downers grove, illinois. he was appointed in 2010 to the illinois senate to fill in for a senator who resigned, and went on to be elected as representative for his suburban chicago district. in his resignation notice he also said he was no longer willing to miss so many family events.

" proposed u.s. sanctions targeting myanmar s military for its treatment of rohingya muslims would hinder the fledgling civilian government sharing power with the generals, a spokesman for de facto leader aung san suu kyi said on friday. the bill, introduced by members of the u.s. senate on the eve of donald trump s departure on his first trip to asia since becoming president in january, seeks to reimpose some sanctions lifted last year as myanmar returned to democracy. the measure would impose targeted sanctions and travel curbs on myanmar military officials and bar the united states from supplying most assistance to the military until perpetrators of atrocities against the rohingya in myanmar s western rakhine state are held accountable. responding to the moves in washington, suu kyi s spokesman, zaw htay, told reuters,  we need internal stability to improve the country s economy. imposing international sanctions directly affects the people in travel and in business investments, and there are many bad consequences.  myanmar officials would explain the government s efforts on rakhine during a visit by secretary of state rex tillerson scheduled for nov. 15, he added.  we will explain to him what we are doing when he comes here. we can not tell him not to do that. and we don t know what is u.s. policy,  zaw htay said. zaw htay, a former army major who is a holdover from the quasi civilian administration that handed over the reins last year, said the army, known as the tatmadaw, had to be involved in myanmar s transition. myanmar was previously hit by sanctions over the military junta s brutal suppression of the then opposition led by suu kyi, but zaw htay stressed the civilian government still has to work with the military.    the country s reconstruction cannot be done only by the government. the tatmadaw needs to be involved, it is very clear. everything has to undergo negotiation with the tatmadaw under the 2008 constitution,  he said, referring to the charter drawn up by the junta before myanmar began its democracy transition.   sanctions and pressures affect the government s work. it won t be a positive result if they impose sanctions, as with the previous experience (of sanctions).  he added,  of course, it will damage all the business investments, not only military owned (businesses). it will definitely have a bad affect. there can only be bad results.  republican senate armed services committee chairman john mccain, and senator ben cardin, the top democrat on the senate foreign relations committee, were among the lawmakers who have sponsored the bill.  a companion bill is also being introduced in the house of representatives.  members of congress have pressed for a strong response to the plight of the rohingya, and the trump administration has been weighing labeling the actions by myanmar s military as  ethnic cleansing . myanmar has rejected that accusation, defending the military s actions as a counter insurgency operation provoked by rohingya militant attacks on 30 security posts in rakhine state on aug. 25. more than 600,000 rohingya muslims have fled buddhist majority myanmar since the military crackdown that has led to reports of burnt villages and widespread killings. the united nations has denounced it as a classic example of ethnic cleansing. zaw htay said myanmar was calling for the international community to  cooperate positively  on the rakhine issue, rather than focusing on what he called mere allegations of abuse by security forces.  we are not ignoring human rights abuses,  he said.  they are all allegations. the international diplomats and international organizations who are saying what happened are always using allegations, without evidence. no one can give strong evidence of their allegations, although we asked for it.  myanmar had so far been unable to take action based on the claims made by refugees in bangladesh, he said.  we will take action if they are right...so cooperate with us by showing strong evidence, rather than basing it on just allegations.

" the u.s. senate on tuesday confirmed former justice department lawyer christopher wray as fbi chief, nearly three months after the agency’s previous director, james comey, was fired by president donald trump. wray, who was confirmed by vote of 92 5, will take charge of the country’s top domestic law enforcement agency during a federal probe into allegations of collusion between the trump presidential campaign and russia. since the dismissal of comey on may 9, the justice department has appointed robert mueller as special counsel to oversee the investigation with the help of the fbi. russia denies any interference, and trump has denied collusion with russia. wray vowed in his confirmation hearing last month to remain independent and not be swayed by politics or pressure from the president. he also praised muller as the “consummate straight shooter.” he also worked with comey on the government’s case in the enron corp fraud scandal in the early 2000s.  during the confirmation hearing, republican senate judiciary committee chairman chuck grassley said wray’s background showed he was committed to independence, an attribute he said was “vitally important” in the next fbi director.  wray served as assistant attorney general in charge of the criminal division at the justice department under former republican president george w. bush.  former attorney general eric holder and former deputy attorney general sally yates, both democrats who served under president barack obama, endorsed wray.

"the cdc is investigating an outbreak of a bacterial infection linked to puppies sold through the national pet store chain petland.the outbreak of campylobacter infections has sickened 39 people from seven states, including florida, kansas, missouri, ohio, pennsylvania, tennessee, and wisconsin.so far nine people have been hospitalized. no deaths have been reported.campylobacter can cause a gastrointestinal illness in humans with symptoms of diarrhea, cramping, abdominal pain, vomiting, and fever. the illness typically lasts about a week and symptoms appear within two to five days after exposure. people more likely to get a severe infection include children younger than 5, adults older than 65, pregnant women, and people with weakened immune systems, including those with the genetic blood disorder thalassemia or hiv or people receiving chemotherapy.investigators say evidence indicates that puppies sold through petland stores are a likely source of this current outbreak. the bacteria can spread through contact with dog feces. it usually does not spread from one person to another.twelve of those affected are petland employees from four states. the other 27 people either recently purchased a puppy at petland, visited a petland store, or visited or live in a home with a puppy sold through petland before illness began.the cdc says the pet store chain is cooperating with health officials to address the outbreak.  cbs 58 ",1
" the united states, britain and other countries opposed to syrian president bashar al assad will not support the reconstruction of the country until there is a political transition “away from assad,” british foreign secretary boris johnson said on monday. the “friends of syria” group, an alliance of mainly western and gulf arab countries, met in new york on monday on the sidelines of the u.n. general assembly at a time when the conflict in syria, now in its seventh year, appears to be less urgent with attention focused on the north korean nuclear threat and the fate of the iran nuclear deal. “we believe that the only way forward is to get a political process going and to make it clear to the iranians, russians and assad regime that we, the like minded group, will not support the reconstruction of syria until there is such a political process and that means, as resolution 2254 says, to a transition away from assad,” johnson said. he was speaking after a meeting of about 14 countries that back the syrian opposition including france, saudi arabia, turkey and the united states.  the u.n. security council has adopted a syria transition road map through a geneva led process. russia joined the war on assad’s behalf in 2015, turning the momentum in his favor. assad also enjoys robust support from iran and lebanon’s hezbollah. meanwhile, the moderate syrian opposition is moribund and the united states has largely stepped back from a leading role in syrian diplomacy. earlier this year the trump administration also halted the cia’s covert program to equip and train certain rebel groups fighting assad. acting assistant secretary of state for near eastern affairs, david satterfield, said all those at the meeting agreed that “there has got to be a political process if there is to be any international participation in the reconstruction of syria.” “the regime and the regime supporters cannot declare a victory solely based on a map and colors of positions on the ground,” satterfield said. “the reconstruction of syria depends very much on that credible political process. that political process is focused on geneva and the role of the united nations.” the meeting on monday was in stark contrast to last year’s which took place after a ceasefire deal between the united states and russia effectively collapsed when an aid convoy was bombed in aleppo, syria’s largest city. aleppo is now in the hands of assad’s forces and assad himself is in a much stronger position, thanks to russian and iranian support. the last major international attempt to resolve the crisis ended in failure when the international syria support group (issg), which included iran, was cast aside after syrian government forces retook the rebel stronghold of aleppo in 2016. russia, turkey and iran have been negotiating separately for months in astana to try to reduce the violence on the ground by creating de escalation zones across the country, although those talks do not cover a long term political solution “we discussed here how to bring it back to the u.n. led process and geneva,” swedish foreign minister margot wallström told reuters. asked if there was consensus on that, she said “i would say so.”  “it’s good if the astana process leads to de escalation and a reduction of the violence but it has to lead into the political process.” earlier on monday, france warned that the status quo in syria risked leading to the country’s permanent fragmentation and opening the door to new radical islamist groups. foreign minister jean yves le drian told reporters in new york he would hold a meeting with the four other permanent members of the security council   britain, china, russia and the united states   on thursday to persuade them to create a contact group to give new impetus to end the seven year conflict. le drian said “realism” dictated that assad could not stay in power after millions of syrians had fled the country due to the war, but that it was vital major powers worked together to help revive u.n. brokered peace talks in geneva. dutch foreign minister bert koenders said the french contact group proposal was not discussed at the friends of syria meeting.  but riyad hijab, a prominent syrian opposition leader, said he told french president emmanuel macron that the initiative was important in part because “of american withdrawal and russia is dominating the entire process. so mr. macron’s initiative  is the right way to fix this because it’s vital all five (permanent security council members) are involved in the process.” ",0
" a u.s. judge on monday questioned attorneys defending the trump administration about a classified report the government is using to justify its latest ban on citizens of some countries from entering the united states. u.s. district court judge theodore chuang in maryland heard arguments for and against president donald trump’s new travel ban, set to take effect on wednesday. it indefinitely limits travel from iran, libya, syria, yemen, somalia, chad and north korea. certain government officials from venezuela were also barred. all those countries except chad, north korea and venezuela were included in two earlier temporary versions of the travel ban, which trump’s opponents called thinly veiled attempts to fulfill his campaign pledge of a “total and complete shutdown of muslims entering the united states.” lawyers for advocacy groups including the international refugee assistance project, iranian alliances across borders and the council on american islamic relations urged chuang to block implementation of what critics call trump’s “muslim ban.” opponents say the ban violates the u.s. constitution because it discriminates against muslims while overstepping the bounds of u.s. immigration law by discriminating by nationality. trump has said the restrictions are needed to tighten security and prevent terrorist attacks. the third ban came in a sept. 24 presidential proclamation that trump issued after acting homeland security secretary elaine duke provided him with a classified report recommending the travel restrictions. chuang asked hashim mooppan, the attorney representing the government, if there were inconsistencies between the homeland security report and trump’s proclamation. mooppan declined to discuss details of the classified report, and said the government does not have to explain whether trump’s advisers disagreed about the ban. “we stand by the factual representations in the proclamation,” mooppan said. on friday, in a separate case against the ban in hawaii, the government said the judge can review the classified report only in a secure setting. chuang struck down an earlier iteration of the ban, which was only partially restored by the u.s. supreme court in june. an attorney from the american civil liberties union, omar jadwat, argued that the new version is a “a bigger, tougher version of the same ban” that trump originally wanted. trump could have achieved the same national security goals with “far more targeted measures” similar to the restrictions on venezuelan government officials, rather than broad bans against certain nationalities, argued justin cox, an attorney at the national immigration law center. mooppan argued that because the new version of the ban went in place after a thorough review, it does not constitute a “muslim ban.” the third version of the ban omitted iraq, which was included in the first ban and sudan, which was in the second version. “the proclamation dropped multiple muslim countries and exempted multiple types of non immigrant visas even from the muslim countries,” he said. “that is strong evidence that this is not some kind of muslim ban in disguise.” chuang said he would rule later on whether to grant the challengers’ request for an injunction.

" india is deploying thousands of riot police and shutting down internet services in two northern states, as it prepares for the sentencing on monday of a self styled  godman  whose followers went on the rampage after he was convicted of rape on friday. gurmeet ram rahim singh s cult dera sacha sauda has a vast rural following in punjab and haryana states, where frenzied mobs burned down gas stations and train stations and torched vehicles after a local court found him guilty of raping two women in a 2002 case. at least 38 people were killed and more than 200 injured in the violence in haryana, officials said, drawing sharp criticism for the state government run by prime minister narendra modi s bharatiya janata party (bjp). the case has also highlighted the indian heartland s fascination with spiritual gurus, who enjoy immense political clout for their ability to mobilize millions of followers frustrated by the shortcomings of the state. security forces have cordoned off a jail in rohtak city, 70 km (44 miles) from new delhi, where singh   also known as the guru of bling for the clothes he wears in the movies he has starred in   is being held. the judge who convicted singh will hold a special hearing inside the prison in rohtak around 2.30 pm local time (0900 gmt) on monday to decide the punishment, in a move that officials hope will prevent his followers from gathering in the streets like they did on friday. singh faces a minimum of seven years in prison. the town of sirsa, home to dera s headquarters, is already under lockdown, bs sandhu, haryana s police chief, told reuters. school and colleges have been ordered shut, the government said.  we re fully prepared, we have a contingency plan in place,   sandhu said, adding that more than 10,000 police would patrol the state as it awaits singh s sentencing. neighboring punjab, where violence was sporadic, has summoned more than 8,000 paramilitary and police, banned large gatherings and switched off mobile internet connections across the state until tuesday, its top administrator said.  our intelligence reports caution that there could be arson and some other incidents,  karan avtar singh, the chief secretary to punjab government, told reuters. in godman singh s two films,  messenger of god  and its sequel, there are sequences in which he fights off villains and tosses burning motorbikes into the air. in his spiritual avatar, singh dresses in plain white traditional clothes, giving sermons or planting trees. in the movies he dons bejeweled costumes, rides motorbikes and sends bad guys flying. the haryana government has faced severe criticism from opposition congress and a state court for failing to stop the rioting and vandalism. singh, whose verified twitter profile calls him a saint, philanthropist, sportsman, actor, singer, movie director, writer, lyricists, and autobiographer, has been photographed with senior bjp leaders including haryana chief minister manohar lal khattar. last year a haryana minister announced the state would donate 5 million indian rupees ($78,000) to singh s dera to promote sports. bir kumar yadav, bjp s haryana spokesman, said the party had been associated with singh only in his capacity as a social worker who had spread awareness about public sanitation and cleanliness. modi also weighed in on sunday, vowing tough action against anyone trying to break the law.  i want to assure my countrymen that people who take the law into their own hands and are on the path of violent suppression   whether it is a person or a group   neither this country nor any government will tolerate it,  he said in his monthly radio address, without directly mentioning the recent violence. singh s conviction in a rape case is the latest in a series of cases involving spiritual leaders who have been accused of sexually abusing followers, amassing untaxed money and finding favor with politicians. besides the rape charges, he is also under investigation over allegations that he convinced 400 of his male followers to undergo castration, allegations he denies.

" billionaire carl icahn will advise donald trump on rescinding what the activist investor called “excessive regulation” on u.s. businesses, the president elect’s transition team announced on wednesday. icahn will serve as a special adviser, not a federal employee, and he will not have specific duties, trump’s team said in a statement. he will not take a salary, a transition aide said. the pick could draw scrutiny because icahn, whose major investments include insurer american international group and oil refining business cvr energy, could help shape rules meant to police wall street and protect the environment. in the transition team statement released on wednesday, icahn said it was time to “break free of excessive regulation” and let businesses create jobs. icahn, an early supporter of trump’s white house bid who has at times been outspoken about regulation, has already helped the transition team weigh candidates to lead the securities and exchange commission. he has held meetings at his new york city office, not far from trump tower but away from reporters staked out there, people familiar with the talks said.  current sec chair mary jo white will leave in january. candidates to replace her have included former sec commissioner paul atkins and debra wong yang, a former federal prosecutor, a source familiar with the matter said. over the years, icahn’s businesses have had occasional regulatory run ins, according to disclosures with the financial industry regulatory authority. he is a large investor in nutrition supplement maker herbalife, which said at one time it was investigated by the sec.      “voters who wanted trump to drain the swamp just got another face full of mud,” democratic national committee spokesman eric walker said in a statement, referring to trump’s pledge to clean up washington.     icahn, who was once known as a corporate raider, said in a recent reuters interview the 2010 dodd frank banking law “went too far.” he is a critic of the u.s. biofuels program that requires oil companies to use renewable fuels such as ethanol. “i do believe that, to some extent, we have gone overboard concerning the environment. but i leave that to the experts in that area,” icahn told cnn in a recent interview. trump and icahn share some history in the casino business. icahn this year helped shutter the trump taj mahal casino resorts in atlantic city, two years after buying it out of bankruptcy. the casino was once a prized part of trump’s empire.

" u.s. defense secretary ash carter said on thursday he would support lifting restrictions on the sale of weapons to vietnam, in the latest sign of thawing ties between former enemies whose focus has shifted in recent years to china’s military buildup. when asked by senator john mccain, chairman of the senate armed services committee and a former prisoner of war in vietnam, if he would support lifting the restrictions, carter said at a hearing: “we’ve discussed this in the past and i appreciate your leadership in that regard, chairman, and yes.” carter did not elaborate, although his comments come ahead of a planned visit to vietnam by u.s. president barack obama late next month. the united states partially lifted a long time ban on lethal weapons sales to vietnam in october 2014, nearly 40 years after the end of the vietnam war, to help the country patrol and defend itself in the south china sea in the face of growing naval challenges from china. at the time, u.s. officials said future sales could include airborne systems.  carter pledged on a visit to vietnam last year to provide it $18 million to help its coast guard buy u.s. patrol boats. but the united states has said that fully lifting the embargo will depend on improved human rights conditions in vietnam.  “there are a number of factors that we must consider with regard to lifting the ban, including progress on human rights,” the state department’s top human rights official, tom malinowski, said on tuesday after an annual human rights dialogue with vietnam on monday.

" the leaders of india and japan agreed on thursday to deepen defense ties and push for more cooperation with australia and the united states, as they seek to counter growing chinese influence across asia. prime minister shinzo abe arrived this week in his counterpart narendra modi s home state, skipping the tradition of visiting the capital of new delhi, for the tenth meeting between two leaders since modi came to power in 2014. relations have deepened between asia s second and third largest economies as abe and modi, who enjoy a close personal relationship, increasingly see eye to eye to balance china as the dominant asian power.  almost everything that takes place during the visit, including economic deals, will in part be done with china in mind,  eurasia analysts said in a note.   abe s visit comes days after new delhi and beijing agreed to end the longest and most serious military confrontation along their shared and contested border in decades, a dispute that had raised worries of a broader conflict between the asian giants.  in a lengthy joint statement, india and japan said deepening security links was paramount. this included collaboration on research into unmanned ground vehicles and robotics and the possibility of joint field exercises between their armies. there was also  renewed momentum  for cooperation with the united states and australia. earlier this year, india rejected an australian request to be included in four country naval drills for fear of angering beijing.  relations between india and japan are not only a bilateral relationship but have developed into a strategic global partnership,  abe told reporters in gandhinagar, the capital of western gujarat state.  we (india and japan) will strengthen our collaboration with those countries with whom we share universal values.  abe flew to gujarat to lay the foundation stone of a $17 billion bullet train project, india s first, that was made possible by a huge japanese loan.  tokyo wants to win other high speed rail lines india plans to build, to edge out chinese ambitions to do the same and provide a boost for its high end manufacturers. the visit was light on specific announcements, but india said it welcomed proposals for increased japanese investment into infrastructure projects in its remote northeast, a region new delhi sees as its gateway to southeast asia.  china claims part of india s northeast as its own territory. japanese investment into the northeast  would give legs to our act east policy,  indian foreign secretary s. jaishankar told reporters. modi and abe also said they would push for more progress on the development of industrial corridors for the growth of asia and africa.  analysts say the planned $40 billion asia africa growth corridor takes direct aim at china s belt and road project, envisaged as a modern day  silk road  connecting china by land and sea across asia and beyond to the middle east, europe and africa.

" the united states on monday outlined a tough negotiating strategy for revising the 1994 north american free trade agreement and for the first time in a u.s. trade deal said it would seek to deter currency manipulation by trading partners. in a much anticipated document sent to lawmakers ahead of talks expected next month, u.s. trade representative robert lighthizer said the trump administration aimed to reduce the u.s. trade deficit by improving access for u.s. goods exported to canada and mexico, the two countries in nafta besides the united states. the document asserts that no country should manipulate currency exchange to gain an unfair competitive advantage. the 17 page summary of negotiations for nafta offers a glimpse into what a trump administration trade agenda could look like. until now, president donald trump’s agenda has been shaped by campaign rhetoric and tweets. while canada and mexico are not considered currency manipulators, the reference in the list of objectives could set a template for future trade deals such as a pending negotiation to modify a five year old u.s. south korea free trade deal. south korea is on a u.s. treasury monitoring list for possible signs of currency manipulation.  among the priorities, lighthizer said the administration would seek to eliminate a trade dispute mechanism that has largely prohibited the united states from pursuing anti dumping and anti subsidy cases against canadian and mexican firms. it also plans to eliminate a range of non tariff barriers to u.s. agricultural exports to canada and mexico. these include subsidies and unfair pricing structures. ustr said it would seek to strengthen nafta’s rules of origin to ensure that the pact’s benefits do not go to outside countries and to “incentivize” the sourcing of u.s. goods. it offered no details on such incentives and did not specify how much of a product’s components must originate from within north america. the demands that the trump administration makes in the nafta talks could have far reaching implications for u.s. trade relations across the globe, with china keen to make inroads with mexico and canada if the united states is seen to be retreating. lighthizer said the negotiations would begin no earlier than aug. 16, 2017. u.s. labor union leaders and democratic lawmakers weighed in on the issue early, reminding trump they expect him to keep 2016 election campaign promises to protect american workers in nafta talks. they stopped short of demanding termination of the 1994 trade pact with canada and mexico. richard trumka, president of the afl cio, an umbrella organization of unions representing 12.5 million workers, said nafta had been an “unequivocal failure” and should be completely renegotiated. “we will do everything we can to make this a good agreement and to hold the president at his word and make sure we get a renegotiation,” he told a conference call with reporters. “if it comes out that it is not a good deal, no deal is better than a bad deal,” trumka said. nafta has quadrupled trade among the three countries, surpassing $1 trillion in 2015. over a decade to 2010, however, the united states lost nearly 6 million manufacturing jobs. the u.s. trade balance with mexico also swung from a small surplus in 1994 to deficits that have exceeded $60 billion for most of the past decade.

" the trump administration has told agencies within the department of health and human services to avoid using certain words or phrases in official documents being drafted for next year’s budget, the washington post reported on saturday. the newspaper said one of the agencies, the u.s. centers for disease control and prevention, was given a list of seven prohibited words or phrases: “vulnerable,” “entitlement,” “diversity,” “transgender,” “fetus,” “evidence based” and “science based.” officials at a second agency were also told to use “obamacare” instead of the affordable care act to describe president barack obama’s 2010 healthcare law and to use “exchanges” instead of “marketplaces” in reference to venues where people can buy federally subsidized health insurance, the post reported. the hhs pushed back on the report.  “the assertion that hhs has ‘banned words’ is a complete mischaracterization of discussions regarding the budget formulation process,” spokesman matt lloyd said in a statement.  “hhs will continue to use the best scientific evidence available to improve the health of all americans. hhs also strongly encourages the use of outcome and evidence data in program evaluations and budget decisions,” he said. the newspaper said state department documents also now refer to sex education as “sexual risk avoidance.” a briefing at the second hhs agency relied on a document from the white house office of management and budget, which oversees president donald trump’s annual budget proposal to congress, according to the post.   the post said no explanations were given for the language changes.

" u.s. defense secretary jim mattis on tuesday played down an apparent split between the u.s. president and his top diplomat over outreach to north korea, saying america’s focus was still on finding a diplomatic solution to the dispute with pyongyang. president donald trump, who has traded insults and threats with north korean leader kim jong un in recent weeks, said on sunday secretary of state rex tillerson was “wasting his time” trying to negotiate with north korea over its nuclear weapons program. tillerson, during a trip to china on saturday, said the united states had direct channels of communication with the north and was probing pyongyang to see if it was interested in dialogue. he expressed hope for reducing tensions with north korea, which is fast advancing toward its goal of developing a nuclear tipped missile capable of hitting the u.s. mainland. “i do not see the divergence as strongly as some ... have interpreted it,” mattis said. both mattis and marine general joseph dunford, chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, broadly backed tillerson’s efforts as they testified at the hearing before the senate armed services committee. “president trump’s guidance to both secretary tillerson and me has been very clearly that we would ... pursue the diplomatic effort to include with the various initiatives with china,” mattis told a senate hearing. “i believe that secretary tillerson is accurately stating that we are probing for opportunities to talk with the north. all we’re doing is probing. we’re not talking with them, consistent with the president’s dismay about not talking with them before the time is right.” trump has vowed to halt north korea’s nuclear ambitions and tensions have escalated in recent months, with pyongyang conducting its sixth and largest nuclear test on sept. 3. it has also threatened to test a hydrogen bomb over the pacific. dunford, the top u.s. military officer, strongly backed tillerson’s efforts to tighten an economic squeeze on north korea. the international community’s sanctions will need to be strong enough to convince kim he cannot survive in power unless he changes course, he said. dunford said kim sees possession of ballistic missiles and a nuclear capability as inextricably linked to regime survival, adding: “what i think kim jong un needs to realize is that he cannot survive with ballistic missiles and nuclear weapons because the international community will not allow him to survive.” dunford said kim was particularly sensitive to the flow of oil into north korea, saying when there has been a cut off in the past “there’s been a change in kim jong un’s behavior.” “the fact is he needs economic resources external to the country to survive,” he said. u.s. senator jack reed questioned whether some degree of communication was vital between washington and pyongyang, given the risks of miscalculation by either side that could lead to conflict. mattis suggested that the trump administration was exploring a host of ways to influence the north, including through diplomacy. “i think the president dispatching secretary tillerson to beijing here within the past several days to carry messages and to look at the way we can work with them is the most accurate answer to your question, that in fact this is part of a whole ... integrated effort that we have underway right now,” mattis said. it was not the first time the white house and state department have seemed at odds on policy issues, but the white house has said trump still had confidence in tillerson. trump has vowed to halt north korea’s nuclear ambitions and tensions have escalated in recent months, with pyongyang conducting its sixth and largest nuclear test on sept. 3. it has also threatened to test a hydrogen bomb over the pacific. the fate of americans held in north korea is also a bone of contention. the trump administration has demanded north korea release three u.s. citizens it has detained: missionary kim dong chul and academics tony kim and kim hak song. the trump white house and state department have taken divergent stances on other foreign policy issues. when a dispute over qatar erupted this year, trump strongly backed gulf arab leaders who accuse qatar of supporting iran as well as islamist militants.  trump accused qatar of being a “high level” funder of terrorism even as the pentagon and tillerson cautioned against the military, commercial and humanitarian effects of a boycott imposed by arab states. months into the dispute, trump adopted a position more in line with that of the state department.

" china said on wednesday that it respects robert mugabe s decision to resign as zimbabwe s president, a week after the african country s army and mugabe s former political allies moved to end his four decades of rule. the 93 year old mugabe had clung on for a week after an army takeover, and finally resigned on tuesday, moments after parliament began an impeachment process, prompting dancing in the streets of the capital, harare.  china has close ties with zimbabwe and traditionally also with mugabe himself, who is reviled in the west as a despot whose disastrous handling of the economy and willingness to resort to violence to maintain power destroyed one of africa s most promising states. chinese foreign ministry spokesman lu kang told a regular news briefing that china was happy to see zimbabwe peacefully and appropriately resolve the issue via talks, and that its policy toward the country would not change.  china respects mr mugabe s decision to resign. he remains a good friend of the chinese people,  lu said, adding that mugabe had made  historic contribution to zimbabwe s independence and liberation . zimbabwe s army seized power after mugabe sacked his former vice president, emmerson mnangagwa, who was a favorite to succeed him.  mugabe s move was an apparent bid to smooth a path to the presidency for his wife grace, 52, known to her critics as  gucci grace  for her reputed fondness for luxury shopping. mnangagwa is expected to be sworn in within days and serve the remainder of mugabe s term until the next election, which must be held by september 2018. asked about a u.s. call for free elections in zimbabwe, lu said china believed it could handle its own affairs and china hoped other countries would not interfere.  china and zimbabwe have a close diplomatic and economic relationship, and china had stood with mugabe s government in the face of western economic sanctions, investing in auto, diamond, tobacco and power station projects. in august, zimbabwe said a chinese company planned to invest up to $2 billion to revive operations at zimbabwe iron and steel company (zisco), which ceased production in 2008 at the height of an economic meltdown.  that year, china vetoed a proposed western backed u.n. resolution that would have imposed an arms embargo on zimbabwe and financial and travel restrictions on mugabe and 13 other officials, saying it would  complicate , rather than ease, conflict.

"thank god she has a vagina, otherwise her blatant hypocrisy might be an issue with voters hillary clinton is facing more questions about her close ties to wall street financial institutions. last week, the new york times urged clinton to release transcripts of her highly-compensated speeches to wall street firm goldman sachs.the paid speeches are just a slim chapter of her relationship with financial titans. according to clinton foundation records, wall street financial institutions have donated around $40 million to the eponymous family foundation.as a non-profit, the clinton foundation isn t legally required to disclose its donors or contributions. the foundation has publicly disclosed some contributions on its website. it only provides ranges for contributions, e.g. $1-5 million, and doesn t detail when the contribution was made or for what purpose, if any.here s the chart of contributions from wall street to the clinton foundation.all together, contributions from readily identifiable wall street institutions to the foundation total somewhere between $11 million and $41 million in contributions. if we assume the donations fall in the middle of the ranges disclosed by the clinton foundation, the contributions would total just under $30 million.as with most things involving the clintons, the devil is in the details. this total of contributions does not include those made by individuals with strong wall street ties. it also does not necessarily represent the total amounts contributed to the foundation from those donors listed. it only accounts for the donations which the foundation has chosen to disclose.the failure of the foundation to include any information on the timing of the donations is especially worrisome. in terms of donor relationships, there is a real difference between a one-time gift of $1 million and an ongoing gift of $200,000 for 5 straight years. the total dollar amount may be the same, but an ongoing gift usually requires a more substantive relationship between the foundation and the donor.there is, of course, an added dimension to the timing issue with the clintons. during the life of the foundation, hillary clinton has been a us senator, secretary of state and two-time candidate for president.when the clinton foundation discloses that the  friends of saudi arabia  contributed $1-5 million, it begs the obvious question of when that donation was made. the specific date of that donation is particularly important, given clinton s considerable focus on the middle east while she was secretary of state.it is also important to note that these contributions are completely seperate from the paid speeches made by bill and hillary clinton. in 2013 alone, hillary earned just over $3 million in paid speeches to financial firms and institutions.these contributions, obviously, also don t include direct contributions made by wall street institutions and individuals to either of clinton s presidential campaigns.for entire story: breitbart news",1

" the united states could influence or even disrupt work by other nations to combat climate change until late 2020 even if president donald trump quits a global agreement, legal scholars said on wednesday. trump will honor a campaign pledge to pull out of the 195 nation paris agreement, a source briefed on the decision told reuters on tuesday. trump tweeted he would announce his formal decision “over the next few days”. u.n. rules for the 2015 pact, which seeks to shift the world economy from fossil fuels this century, say washington would formally have to wait until november 2020 to withdraw. trump could shorten the formalities to just one year by exiting paris’ 1992 parent treaty. quitting the paris agreement would leave trump in a legal grey zone until the next u.s. presidential election in 2020, retaining a vote as other nations work on detailed rules on issues such as how to monitor greenhouse gas emissions. in the worst case “the u.s. could make it more difficult to adopt the paris rules”, said daniel bodansky, a law professor at arizona state university. “to the extent that (withdrawal from paris) is already going to harm relations with our allies, staying in and being obstructionist would be even more harmful,” he said. trump has promised to promote the coal industry over renewables. bodansky noted, however, that washington did not try to obstruct other nations’ work on the 1997 kyoto protocol, which obliged rich nations to cut emissions, after president george w. bush angered u.s. allies by deciding in 2001 not to take part. megan bowman, a law lecturer at king’s college, london, said the four year waiting period was partly intended to insulate the agreement from a shift to a republican presidency after democratic president barack obama. “the downside ... is that if they (the united states) are recalcitrant they are sitting at the table, able to obstruct or stall the process,” she said. paris imposes few legal obligations before 2020 and has no sanctions for non compliance. the paris agreement’s article 28 says any nation wanting to pull out has to wait three years from the date the agreement gained legal force, which was nov. 4, 2016, before seeking to leave. it then has to wait another year. in berlin, european commission president jean claude juncker stressed that withdrawal would take years. “the americans can’t just leave the climate protection agreement. mr. trump believes that because he doesn’t know the details.” trump would be taking a riskier step by withdrawing from paris’ parent treaty, the 1992 climate convention, even though it would require only a year’s notice and void u.s. commitments under paris. that convention, seeking voluntary actions to rein in greenhouse gas emissions and a landmark in cooperation between rich and poor nations, has had bipartisan u.s. support. it was signed by republican president george bush. paris goes one step further by obliging all nations to set domestic targets to curb emissions to limit a creeping rise in temperatures blamed for more heat waves, downpours and rising sea levels. leaving the convention would make the united states an “international pariah on global climate change”, said robert stavins, director of harvard university’s environmental economics program. johan rockstrom, director of the stockholm resilience centre, said a u.s. presence in the paris negotiations until 2020 would be “the most negative thing ... they would still be allowed to vote in the room”. but he said a quick, clean break by the united states from the 1992 convention might be best for other nations which could then work without risks of obstruction.

" a meeting between mexican president enrique pena nieto and u.s. president donald trump on friday at the g20 summit in germany will last about 30 minutes and probably not lead to any major agreements, mexico’s foreign minister said on wednesday. the face to face talks will be the first between pena nieto and trump as presidents. mexican foreign minister luis videgaray warned not to expect too much. “we have to put it in context and not have expectations that are unjustified,” videgaray said. trump’s election and his early days in office strained relations between the two neighbors because of his threats to apply tariffs to mexican made goods and a plan to build a wall on the southern u.s. border and force mexico to pay for it. trump and pena nieto will discuss renegotiations of the north american free trade agreement scheduled for august, as well as cooperation in combating drug cartels and development in central america, the foreign ministry said. pena nieto will also talk about the rights of mexican migrants in the united states, the ministry said. later on wednesday, pena nieto and videgaray met with u.s. homeland security secretary john kelly, who was visiting mexico ahead of the g20 summit along with cia director mike pompeo. according to a statement from pena nieto’s office, both sides agreed to work together on security and pena nieto praised the trump administration’s decision to keep in place a program that allows some immigrants, brought into the country illegally by their parents, to stay. one topic not on the agenda at the encounter in hamburg is trump’s pledge to build a wall on the u.s. mexico border, videgaray said in an earlier television interview.   in late january, a planned meeting between the two presidents was canceled following a twitter dispute over trump’s pledge to make mexico pay for the wall, which the mexican government has insisted it will not do. trump has since said he will find a way for mexico to repay the united states for construction of the wall but that congress would need to fund it first. his administration also toned down threats to pull out of the nafta pact with mexico and canada. last august, during trump’s presidential campaign, he accepted an invitation to visit mexico in what became a public relations disaster for pena nieto, who was widely condemned for inviting a man who has united mexicans like few others in shared disdain.

" when donald trump takes over as president on jan. 20, one of the first business tax breaks he delivers is likely to go to the u.s. medical device industry and companies like mark throdahl’s. the chief executive of orthopediatrics corp, based in northern indiana, said his company has been able to hire more workers since the temporary suspension effective last january of a federal tax on medical devices. the tax was imposed as part of outgoing president barack obama’s signature 2010 healthcare law. throdahl said he hopes the incoming republican led congress and president will permanently repeal the tax. trump and u.s. lawmakers are likely to do that, according to lawmakers, lobbyists and industry executives, in a step that also would help larger medical device makers such as medtronic inc, boston scientific, st. jude medical inc and johnson & johnson. tax cuts are republican gospel, and trump’s new republican administration is widely expected to make them happen. the medical device tax may be one of the first on the chopping block. it was first imposed in january 2013 as a funding mechanism for the affordable care act, dubbed obamacare, a law that has brought medical coverage to millions of previously uninsured americans. but republicans hate obamacare and this particular tax has powerful enemies in both parties. senate republican leader mitch mcconnell said repealing the affordable care act, dubbed obamacare, will be the first order of business in the senate when it convenes in january. whether cutting taxes, including the one on medical devices, will deliver more jobs remains to be seen. the congressional research service, a nonpartisan arm of congress, said in january 2015, when the medical device tax was fully in effect, that it was having only “fairly minor” impact on production of devices and employment in the industry. that may not matter much, as republican lawmakers and lobbyists increasingly try to link tax cuts to job creation, perhaps sensing this connection will resonate with trump, who made big promises in his campaign about restoring u.s. industrial employment. the medical device industry, in its long running assault on the device tax, is seeking to frame the fight as a jobs issue. immediately after trump’s nov. 8 election victory, industry lobbying group advamed wrote to him and vice president elect mike pence, indiana’s governor, asking for permanent repeal of the tax. in the letter, advamed president scott whitaker wrote, “the medical device tax has been a significant drag on medical innovation, and resulted in the loss or deferred creation of jobs, reduced research spending, and slowed capital expansion.” industry complaints like these led congress last year to temporarily suspend the 2.3 percent excise tax on the sale of non retail medical devices, such as pacemakers, heart valves and artificial hips. it had been in effect for only three years. orthopediatrics, founded in 2006, develops and markets implantable orthopedic devices, such as metal plates that can be attached to bones, to treat deformities and traumatic injuries in children. it has 60 employees in its warsaw, indiana headquarters, and 94 sales representatives around the united states. when the tax was in full effect, throdahl said, orthopediatrics “had almost a headcount freeze during 2015” because of the revenue that was siphoned away by the tax. since the tax’s temporary suspension, he said, “we’ve resumed an aggressive pace of hiring and investment.” there are about 9,000 u.s. based medical device manufacturers. the industry accounts for about 520,000 u.s. jobs and has $150 billion in direct sales, advamed spokesman mark brager said. indiana is home to several device companies. so are minnesota, california and massachusetts. lawmakers from these states helped push through the temporary suspension of the device tax. repealing the tax would further improve the already favorable tax profile of medtronic, one of the largest u.s. medical device companies. two years ago, medtronic did an “inversion” deal, which is when a u.s. company shifts its home base to another country, at least on paper, to cut its tax bills. medtronic is now technically based in ireland, though it is still managed in minnesota. asked whether medtronic expects the tax to be repealed, company spokesman fernando vivanco said, “it’s much too early to speculate on future tax policy.” republicans said the industry has little reason to fear that the tax will ever return. senator john barrasso, a member of the senate republican leadership, said obamacare repeal legislation will move next year in a way that will circumvent expected democratic resistance. “the plan is to move the entire piece that we moved last year,” barrasso said, referring to republican backed repeal legislation that ultimately was vetoed by obama. “and it did include the medical device repeal, so i would expect that to be part of the list as well. it’s to repeal the taxes related to obamacare,” barrasso added. j.c. scott, head of government affairs at advamed, said companies “feel a great sense of urgency in trying to get complete repeal done early next year, rather than later in the year, because companies need certainty.” repealing the tax would worsen the federal budget deficit. “any time you repeal a tax, that is a loss of revenue to the federal government,” said jack hoadley, a research professor at georgetown university’s health policy institute. but this tax was never a big one, relatively speaking. when imposed, it raised barely $2.5 billion a year, less than expected. by comparison, federal tax subsidies to help people obtain health insurance under obamacare in 2016 were estimated to be $660 billion, the congressional budget office said. ever since the tax was put on hold, it has been viewed as endangered. “at the time it was suspended, we were told by people in washington that in all probability it will not be reinstituted. but still, we’ll all sleep better at night knowing that it’s gone,” orthopediatrics ceo throdahl said.

" president donald trump said on saturday he will move quickly to nominate a new fbi director, after he sparked a political firestorm by firing the man investigating possible collusion between russia and the trump presidential campaign. trump told reporters he might even be able to make his decision on who should succeed james comey to lead the federal bureau of investigation before he leaves on his first foreign trip on friday. “even that is possible,” trump said, speaking on air force one before departing for lynchburg, virginia, where he delivered a commencement address. “i think the process is going to go quickly,” he said, adding that the candidates under consideration were mostly well known. “they’ve been vetted over their lifetime essentially. but very well known, highly respected, really talented people. and that’s what we want for the fbi.” critics have assailed trump for abruptly dismissing comey, who was leading the agency’s investigation into alleged russian meddling in the 2016 u.s. election, and possible ties between moscow and the trump campaign.. russia denies the claims and the white house says there was no collusion. trump made the remarks to reporters prior to speaking to about 50,000 people at liberty university in lynchburg, where he did not mention comey or the controversy his dismissal on tuesday caused. it was trump’s first public event outside the white house since comey’s ouster. a white house official had said 11 people were under consideration   including acting fbi director andrew mccabe, republican senator john cornyn, new york appeals court judge michael garcia and former assistant attorney general alice fisher   to replace comey as fbi chief. two new names, however, emerged on saturday: fbi special agent adam lee and u.s. district judge henry hudson. a source familiar with the process said attorney general jeff sessions and his deputy, rod rosenstein, had interviewed hudson, lee and five others on saturday. the fbi agents association, which claims more than 13,000 active and retired agents as its members, on saturday endorsed another candidate: former representative mike rogers, who had also worked as an fbi agent. at liberty, the nation’s largest christian college, trump peppered his remarks with the kind of anti establishment rhetoric that fueled his maverick presidential campaign, telling graduates to challenge “entrenched interests.” he thanked the crowd for their support and repeatedly invoked his own unlikely election victory.  “relish the opportunity to be an outsider,” trump said. “the more that a broken system tells you that you’re wrong, the more certain you should be that you must keep pushing ahead.” he also had strong words that seemed aimed at his critics. “no one has ever achieved anything significant without a chorus of critics standing on the sidelines explaining why it can’t be done,” trump said. “nothing is easier or more pathetic than being a critic, because they’re people that can’t get the job done.”  liberty’s president, jerry falwell, jr., was a key early supporter of trump during his campaign and helped rally support among religious conservatives.  trump, who has been preparing for his first foreign trip   one that will take him to the middle east and europe   also will deliver the commencement address to the united states coast guard academy in new london, connecticut, on wednesday.

" puerto rico’s governor on wednesday signed an emergency bill allowing the government to halt payments on its debt, throwing into doubt broader restructuring plans to stave off a financial collapse of the u.s. territory. the measure, which earlier passed puerto rico’s legislature, lets governor alejandro garcia padilla declare a moratorium on any debt payment he deems necessary and could alter the structure of the government development bank (gdb), the island’s primary fiscal agent.  “this legislation provides us with the tools to address the highest priority of needs — providing essential services to our people — without fear of retribution,” garcia padilla said in a statement. puerto rico, burdened by a $70 billion debt load it says it cannot pay, a 45 percent poverty rate and shrinking population, faces economic collapse without measures that either change its laws or involve an agreement with creditors. wednesday’s emergency law was rushed into existence as the gdb faces possible default on a $422 million debt payment due on may 1. garcia padilla had said he would consider a debt moratorium ahead of that deadline. gdb and its creditors are trying to work out a consensual restructuring. but the new law could spark “a new era of litigation” from creditors, said daniel hanson, an analyst with height securities. “we believe the overwhelming majority of puerto rican issuers have violated their creditors’ rights,” he said in a wednesday note. some gdb creditors on monday sued to prevent a run on the bank, asking a federal court to block depositors from taking out their money while talks continue. the passage of the law drew a quick rebuke from some creditors. stephen spencer, a financial adviser to bondholders including oppenheimerfunds and franklin advisers, said it might violate the terms of a prior restructuring deal at prepa, the island’s power utility. that deal, under which creditors agreed to take 15 percent repayment cuts, “should be explicitly preserved, rather than being cast into a state of uncertainty,” spencer said in a statement. he said the law could “close the door to anyone extending new credit to puerto rico, seriously impeding its ability to meet citizens’ needs.” in a statement on wednesday night, prepa executive director javier quintana mendez said the agreement “remains in place and should not be negatively affected by the new law.”  “we continue working in collaboration with our creditors, focused on the implementation of our recovery plan,” quintana said. a second group of creditors holding debt issued by puerto rico’s sales tax authority, cofina, expressed support for the debt freeze bill, citing delays in legislative efforts by federal lawmakers in washington to address puerto rico’s crisis. “with entrenched private institutions obstructing the legislative process in washington, it is understandable that puerto rican leaders are taking steps to equip the island with the tools it needs,” susheel kirpalani, counsel to the cofina senior bondholders group at law firm quinn emanuel, said.    a rescue bill being drafted by the u.s. house of representatives natural resources committee so far uses u.s. bankruptcy rules as guidance for a solution, something many creditors oppose. hearings are expected next week in washington.   relations between puerto rico and its creditors are growing tenser as major debt payments in may and july loom.  on tuesday, some of puerto rico’s general obligation bondholders criticized the debt moratorium law, at the time still being debated by lawmakers, saying puerto rico was ignoring their offer to restructure debt by extending principal payments. garcia padilla appeared to fire back on wednesday, saying “our creditors have engaged in public relations efforts that contain falsehoods about their proposed ‘fixes’ – all of which are aimed at misinforming the public and dissuading congress from doing what is right for our 3.5 million american citizens.” puerto rico’s benchmark 2035 go bond 74514le86=msrb is down sharply since talk of a debt moratorium bill surfaced earlier this week. on wednesday the bond fell 2.45 points in price to bid 63.299, yielding 13.33 percent, according to municipal securities rulemaking board data.  “puerto rico’s problems stopped being legal problems and they’ve started being a math problem... at the end of the day puerto rico can’t pay,” said nicholas venditti, portfolio manager at thornburg investment management in santa fe, speaking at a luncheon for reporters in new york.

" u.s. president donald trump will ask china to cut its financial links with north korea and to abide by u.n. sanctions when meeting with chinese president xi jinping in beijing, a senior white house official said on wednesday. trump arrived in beijing on wednesday afternoon from south korea for a two night stop in the chinese capital as part of his marathon asia tour. the u.s. president was undecided on whether to declare north korea a state sponsor of terrorism by the end of his trip, the official said, speaking to reporters on board air force one. trump believes any talks with the north would require reducing threats, ending provocations and movement toward denuclearization and that no deal can be achieved without denuclearisation, the official added.

" president barack obama on tuesday nominated career diplomat jeffrey delaurentis to be the first u.s. ambassador to cuba in more than five decades, setting up a fierce confirmation battle with republicans in congress opposed to obama’s opening with the communist ruled island. the appointment of delaurentis, the top american official at the u.s. embassy in havana since relations were restored last year, marked obama’s latest move to go as far as he can in normalizing ties between the former cold war foes before he leaves office in january. the nomination must be approved by the republican controlled senate, which is seen as a long shot, especially in a presidential election year and given expected strong resistance from cuban american senators including marco rubio of florida and ted cruz of texas. rubio, in a blistering statement, derided the nomination as a “last ditch legacy project” by obama and said it “should go nowhere.” an individual senator has the power   one that is often invoked   to put a “hold” on an ambassadorial nomination to delay a full senate vote. in a veiled appeal to lawmakers, obama praised delaurentis for his leadership during the normalization process. “we only hurt ourselves by not being represented by an ambassador” in havana, he said in a statement. “having an ambassador will make it easier to advocate for our interests and will deepen our understanding even when we know that we will continue to have differences with the cuban government,” obama said. delaurentis had been widely tipped for the post. but the president held off naming him until now even as cuba appointed its own ambassador to washington shortly after embassies were reopened in both countries’ capitals in july of last year. he would be the first u.s. envoy since philip bonsal, an appointee of president dwight eisenhower, left the post vacant in late 1960. obama traveled to havana in march, the first visit by a u.s. president in 88 years. the trip was made possible by his breakthrough agreement with cuban president raul castro in december 2014 to cast aside decades of hostility that began soon after cuba’s 1959 revolution. since the opening, obama has repeatedly used his executive powers to relax trade and travel restrictions, while pushing cuba to accelerate cautious market style reforms and allow greater political and economic freedom. even so, the u.s. embargo against cuba remains in place, a major irritant in relations. only congress can lift the embargo, and the republican leadership is not expected to allow such a move anytime soon. delaurentis has been u.s. chief of mission in cuba since august 2014, his third posting in havana. he has also held diplomatic posts at the state department in washington, at the u.s. mission to the united nations and in bogota.

" china and the united states must avoid being overly suspicious of each other’s strategic intentions, china’s ambassador to the united states said on wednesday while looking ahead to the presidency of donald trump. trump lambasted china throughout the u.s. election campaign, drumming up headlines with his pledges to slap 45 percent tariffs on imported chinese goods and to label the country a currency manipulator on his first day in office. he has also vowed to build up the u.s. navy in what advisers say will be a strategy to reassure countries in the asia pacific worried about china’s assertive pursuit of territorial claims. china’s washington envoy, cui tiankai, told a film screening to commemorate the 1979 normalization of u.s. china ties that after “a most unusual political season,” it was important to build consensus and identify common ground. he said both countries were already cooperating on many issues, but added: “we have to make greater efforts to promote better mutual understanding and we should be careful not to be overly suspicious about each other’s strategic intentions. “there are people here in the united states who believe that everything that china does is aimed at challenging the united states’ s global dominance, and there are people who believe that everything the u.s. is doing is aimed at containing china. “i think both views are wrong.” there would inevitably be problems and challenges in the next four years, cui said, “but ... i am quite confident that, on the whole, the relationship will move forward on a stable and right track.” cui said the countries had a shared responsibility to cooperate on issues such as terrorism and proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. “we both want stability in the world. we both strive for a stronger global economy, and we both need a better natural environment. common goals call for a close partnership.”  trump and chinese president xi jinping spoke by phone on monday and xi told the u.s. president elect cooperation was the only choice for the world’s two largest economies, while trump said they had established a “clear sense of mutual respect.” nevertheless, trump’s election has created uncertainty when beijing hopes for stability as it faces daunting reform challenges at home, slowing growth and a leadership reshuffle that will assemble a new party elite around xi in late 2017.  zbigniew brzezinski, who as u.s. national security adviser drove normalization with china in the late 1970s told the same washington event the world was watching u.s. political developments “with some stupefaction.” “we are now living in a political system, a worldwide system, that is experiencing a very serious crisis... . (i)t is potentially threatening to both sides, to the well being of global stability,” he said. “you can have serious political problems in china … there are serious problems in the united states. we don’t know how we will be managing responsibilities in the foreseeable future, given some of the initial warning signals,” brzezinski said.

" farmers who fled war in the colombian andes are returning to revive their abandoned land, cultivating coffee trees that are boosting global supplies of the highest quality beans. colombia s five decade civil war, the longest in the americas, displaced millions and disrupted farming for decades in areas that produce coffee for the most exacting consumer. the revival of coffee farming in the former conflict zones could help boost colombia s coffee output by 40 percent, according to government estimates. that would raise global supplies of mild arabica beans by about 13 percent. the additional supply could reduce the cost of the raw material for the world s top roasters, many of whom are seeking to secure increased supply from colombia. about 950 coffee growing families have returned to the san carlos area, representing about 60 percent of the 1,600 families who left during the war, according to data from the colombian coffee growers federation (fnc). the supply from this region, about 330 kilometers (205 miles) north west of the colombian capital of bogota, could expand further as farmers plant more of their land and more people return to the region to provide the needed labor. the area now has about 800 hectares of coffee farms, double the low of 400 hectares during the war. that s still only about half of the 1,500 hectares prior to the conflict, according to fnc data. among those who returned was libardo garcia, who lost two brothers in the conflict   one was shot and the other killed by a landmine. he and his family moved back to their 12 hectare (30 acres) farm in 2015 after fleeing in 2001.   all the coffee trees were dead when we came back,  said garcia, who has since planted 8,000 trees on two hectares of steeply sloped land. arabica is the highest quality coffee bean, and colombia is the world s top producer of mild arabica. to make that variety, beans are separated from the cherry then dried to increase quality. arabica makes up about 60 percent of global coffee supplies, with lower quality robusta beans accounting for the rest. while some coffee roasters add robusta to their highly secretive blends, premium brands are typically 100 percent mild arabica. a peace deal between the government and the rebel revolutionary armed forces of colombia (farc) in late 2016 paved the way for many to return to their homes and farms, including thousands of coffee growers. about 220,000 people died and millions were displaced in decades of fighting among leftist guerillas, paramilitary groups, criminal organizations and government forces. the conflict impacted large areas of the country, and the government struggled to exert control over highlands and remote jungle areas in the west and south of the country. some farmers who stayed through the violence have also switched to coffee from growing coca and other illegal crops that they cultivated during the conflict. coca is used for cocaine production, and the cash from growing it helped finance armed groups during the war. the combination of farmers returning to their abandoned land and others switching to coffee could help boost the country s total output to a record 20 million 60 kg bags by 2020, the government estimates, up from 14.2 million bags in 2016. in the andean region of san carlos, the revival in coffee production has advanced quickly since conflict in the region abated around 2014, when the peace deal was still being negotiated. the country s conflict with rebels began in 1964 and peaked in this region around 2000. after fleeing his farm, garcia spent time in the city of medellin and then in the town of san carlos.  we came back because we love the land,  he said, leaning against the fence outside his home, a brick house adorned with baskets of flowers. wearing a wide brimmed hat, garcia pointed out a former farc stronghold in the distance, in tree covered mountains about an hour s walk from his farm. most of his neighbors have yet to return, he said, either because they are skeptical the peace will last or because they have made lives elsewhere. before moving his family back, garcia traveled the 13 kilometers from nearby san carlos every weekend for three years to plant new coffee trees and remove the dead ones. garcia has plenty of land to expand his farm further but cannot yet find the labor because too few people have returned to surrounding communities. new high yielding trees have helped boost harvests, but the region is still far from reaching its potential because of the labor shortage, said rosa velasques, manager of the local cooperative where about 1,000 local farmers sell their beans. international roasters have jumped at the opportunity to buy more beans from colombia, the world s third largest coffee producer and the source of a third of the world s mild arabica supplies. italian roaster illycaffe has expanded its buying to parts of the country that were unreachable during the violence.  now they ve opened up,  said illycaffe chairman andrea illy. the firm had increased purchases from the region by double digit percentages for the last two to three years, illy said, and it expects growth to continue at similar rates. in 2016, nestle nespresso bought its first coffee from a post conflict region of colombia and launched it this year as a limited edition.  a lot of these regions, nobody had even been in and tasted the coffee until recently,  said katherine graham, nestle nespresso s corporate communications manager.   there are some areas with strong potential,  graham said.  but it needs a lot of development, a lot of work.  starbucks co expanded its partnership with the united states agency for international development to give 1,000 farmers in post conflict zones agricultural training. it also partnered with the inter american development bank to support 2,000 farmers in colombia   mainly women   with a loan initiative. colombian entrepreneur gonzalo navarro launched a roasting company called piccolo piacere in medellin earlier this year, focusing on sourcing from small coffee growers, many in former conflict zones.  we have access to farmers who in the past were growing other things, such as coca,  he said. back near san carlos, farmer rubiela cuervo works a remote farm with her family. she fled to medellin to escape the violence in 2005 but struggled to make a living and returned a year later despite the ongoing violence. she has expanded the farm as peace returned to the area in recent years.  we hope that peace will bring us more employment, more income for our work,  she said.  i m hoping not to be displaced again.  graphic: high quality coffee output by country tmsnrt.rs/2zc9sau ",0
" u.s. democrat hillary clinton raised about $143 million in august for her presidential bid and the democratic party, the her campaign announced on thursday.  of the total, about $62 million was raised for the candidate’s white house run and about $81 million was raised for the democratic national committee and state parties. clinton spend most of the month of august working the democratic fundraising circuit and trying to amass a war chest to use against republican donald trump.  the august hauls included a lucrative two week swing of high dollar events in the moneyed east coast vacation spots of martha’s vineyard and the hamptons, along with star studded luncheons in los angeles and gatherings with high tech leaders in silicon valley. a three day, $19 million fundraising trip to california included a stop at the home of former basketball star magic johnson, lunch at the home of musician justin timberlake and actress jessica biel and an afternoon event in northern california with apple’s tim cook.  twenty people paid at least $200,000 each to attend a nighttime event at the estate where laurene powell jobs is building a dream home designed by her late husband, steve jobs. clinton has already saturated the airwaves in key states with television ads, while trump has spent almost nothing on the general election. trump has struggled to raise large sums of cash. instead, much of his campaign has been self funded, using his personal wealth to fuel his shoestring primary campaign.  but supporters of trump have warned that a general election requires more to be spent on expensive television ads and requires outside fundraising.  trump has not yet released his fundraising totals for the month of august. clinton’s campaign has already announced plans to spend $77 million in swing state advertising before the nov. 8 election.  her campaign said the average donation in march was $50, a signal that she is drawing from small dollar donors and not just those who write checks worth thousands of dollars.  “thanks to the 2.3 million people who have contributed to our campaign, we are heading into the final two months of the race with the resources we need to organize and mobilize millions of voters across the country,” campaign manager robby mook said in a statement.

" the united states on thursday presented for the first time pieces of what it said were iranian weapons supplied to the iran aligned houthi militia in yemen, describing it as conclusive evidence that tehran was violating u.n. resolutions. the arms included charred remnants of what the pentagon said was an iranian made short range ballistic missile fired from yemen on nov. 4 at king khaled international airport outside saudi arabia s capital riyadh, as well as a drone and an anti tank weapon recovered in yemen by the saudis. iran has denied supplying the houthis with such weaponry and on thursday described the arms displayed as  fabricated.  the united states acknowledged it could not say precisely when the weapons were transferred to the houthis, and, in some cases, could not say when they were used. there was no immediate way to independently verify where the weapons were made or employed. but u.s. ambassador to the united nations nikki haley expressed confidence the transfers could be blamed on tehran.   these are iranian made, these are iranian sent, and these were iranian given,  haley told a news conference at a military hangar at joint base anacostia bolling, just outside washington.     all of the recovered weapons were provided to the united states by saudi arabia and the united arab emirates, the pentagon said. saudi led forces, which back the yemeni government, have been fighting the houthis in yemen s more than two year long civil war. the unprecedented presentation   which haley said involved intelligence that had to be declassified   is part of president donald trump s new iran policy, which promises a harder line toward tehran. that would appear to include a new diplomatic initiative.   you will see us build a coalition to really push back against iran and what they re doing,  haley said, standing in front of what she said were the remnants of the nov. 4 missile. israel, saudi arabia and the united arab emirates, who view tehran as a threat, seized upon the u.s. presentation in calls on thursday for international action. still, it was unclear whether the new evidence would be enough to win support for sanctions on iran from some u.n. security council members, like russia or china. british u.n. ambassador matthew rycroft said he didn t think  there s anything that could convince some of my council colleagues  to take u.n. action against iran. still, he said  we re going to be pursuing with them nonetheless.  under a u.n. resolution that enshrines the iran nuclear deal with world powers, tehran is prohibited from supplying, selling or transferring weapons outside the country unless approved by the u.n. security council. a separate u.n. resolution on yemen bans the supply of weapons to houthi leaders. iran rejected the u.s. accusations as unfounded and iran s foreign minister javad zarif, on twitter, drew a parallel to assertions by then u.s. secretary of state colin powell to the united nations in 2003 about u.s. intelligence on weapons of mass destruction in iraq. no weapons of mass destruction were found in iraq after the u.s. led invasion. the pentagon offered a detailed explanation of all of the reasons why it believed the arms came from iran, noting what it said were iranian corporate logos on arms fragments and the unique nature of the designs of iranian weaponry. that included the designs of short range  qiam  ballistic missiles. the pentagon said it had obtained fragments of two qiam missiles, one fired on nov. 4 against the airport and another fired on july 22. the pentagon cited corporate logos it said matched those of iranian defense firms on jet vanes that help steer the missile s engine and on the circuit board helping drive its guidance system. it also said the missile s unique valve design was only found in iran. iran, it said, appeared to have tried to cover up the shipment by disassembling the missile for transport, given crude welding used to stitch it back together.  the point of this entire display is that only iran makes this missile. they have not given it to anybody else,  pentagon spokeswoman laura seal said.  we haven t seen this in the hands of anyone else except iran and the houthis.  a dec. 8 u.n. report monitoring iran sanctions found that the july 22 and nov. 4 missiles fired at saudi arabia appeared to have a  common origin,  but u.n. officials were still investigating the claims that iran supplied them. a separate nov. 24 u.n. report monitoring yemen sanctions said four missiles fired into saudi arabia this year appear to have been designed and manufactured by iran, but as yet there was  no evidence as to the identity of the broker or supplier.  the u.n. iran and yemen sanctions monitors  saw a majority  of the weaponry displayed by haley, said a spokesman for the u.s. mission to the united nations.  the pentagon put on display other weapons with designs it said were unique to iran s defense industry. it pointed to a key component of a toophan anti tank guided missile and a small drone aircraft, both of which it said were recovered in yemen by the saudis. it also showed components of a drone like navigation system like the one the pentagon says was used by the houthis to ram an exploding boat into a saudi frigate on jan. 30. the united arab emirates seized the system in late 2016 in the red sea, the pentagon said. the u.n. security council is due to be briefed publicly on the latest u.n. report monitoring iran sanctions on tuesday.

" in the middle of a confused three day scramble by u.s. republicans to save their plan to dismantle obamacare, president donald trump telephoned a former small town sandwich shop owner from the north carolina mountains on wednesday afternoon. representative mark meadows took the call during a meeting of the freedom caucus, a conservative faction of the house of representatives he chairs. his talk with trump thrust meadows into the eye of a legislative storm that led to a pivotal vote on the bill being postponed. then, late on thursday after trump demanded action by the house, a final vote was set for friday. through it all, meadows has been a key player in trump’s first major legislative initiative, an effort as chaotic and unpredictable as his campaign for the white house, with its ultimate outcome still in doubt late on thursday night. after promising for months as a candidate to repeal and replace obamacare, trump has still not produced his own plan to do so, choosing instead to support a rollback bill drafted by senior house republicans, including house speaker paul ryan. financial markets have watched the drama over the bill nervously, concerned that defeat or delay for it could undermine trump’s ability to carry through on promises to cut taxes and reduce regulation that have lifted u.s. stocks for weeks. in a schism among republicans who now control congress and the white house, moderates oppose ryan’s bill, saying it goes too far. the non partisan congressional budget office has estimated it would result in 24 million fewer americans having insurance by 2026 than if obamacare remained in place intact. meadows and the freedom caucus don’t like it either, but for very different reasons, making a compromise challenging. they say it doesn’t go far enough to repeal the healthcare law put in place in 2010 by former democratic president barack obama.  to deal with this problem, trump stepped in personally earlier this week to try to win over meadows and his maverick conservative faction, according to interviews with dozens of lawmakers and congressional aides. but, even after marathon phone calls and meetings at the white house, trump, who prides himself as a master negotiator, failed to secure the deal. meadows told reporters on thursday night he still opposed the bill, but was optimistic that a deal could be reached. “i am still a no,” he said, taking basically the same position he took on wednesday afternoon after his phone call with trump. when he embraced ryan’s bill and then decided to intervene to try to save it, trump opted for a strategy in which he would concentrate on winning over meadows and the conservatives. ryan and house leaders would deal with “everybody else,” republican representative tom rooney said thursday. that strategic approach soon had embarrassing consequences. trump’s push began in earnest on tuesday, when he visited capitol hill seeking support for the plan among republicans. on wednesday, the house rules committee held marathon meetings to finalize the bill that would go to the floor. after his wednesday phone call with the president, meadows spent much of wednesday night negotiating with trump, said a republican lawmaker. “mark meadows has been at the white house more in the last 48 hours than any other times in his life combined,” said one conservative lobbyist with knowledge of internal discussions. as meadows and other freedom caucus members such as representative jim jordan negotiated with trump, more and more right wing amendments were added to the bill to placate conservatives. the conservative concessions hurt moderates. “the vast majority of us in the republican conference have been left out of these discussions,” representative bradley byrne said thursday. “that is a growing problem for our leadership and i think it’s a growing problem for the chances of this bill.” at some point, ryan himself balked when he learned of the agreements struck between trump and the conservatives, according to the conservative lobbyist, setting in motion a frantic push to save a vote on the bill that had been set for thursday. by late afternoon, that rescue effort had collapsed and the vote was scrapped. trump responded forcefully, dispatching top white house lieutenants to a meeting with lawmakers with a clear message: the president was done negotiating. the message was “it’s done tomorrow or obamacare stays,” said republican representative chris collins. with that, lawmakers announced that a decisive vote on the bill would be held on friday afternoon. earlier, even as the vote that had been set for thursday was falling apart, trump was meeting with trucking industry representatives and gleefully climbed into the cab of an 18 wheeler. he said then that everyone would find out in a couple of hours whether republicans had enough votes to pass the healthcare bill, unaware that the vote had already been delayed.

" the u.s. senate voted on thursday to bolster travel security in the wake of the brussels attacks with measures that include doubling the number of transportation security teams with bomb sniffing dogs at domestic airports and other transit hubs. lawmakers voted overwhelmingly to add security measures to a separate bill that calls for renewing the programs of the federal aviation administration through september 2017. the faa bill is expected to come up for a final vote later this month.    after republicans and democrats reached a deal on security measures earlier in the day, lawmakers voted to raise the number of visible intermodal prevention response, or viper, teams within the transportation security administration from 31 to 60. viper teams, which are intended as a visible deterrent to attacks, can be deployed at airports and train or bus stations. other measures would bolster the vetting of airport employees, add security to vulnerable check in and baggage claim areas and authorize the tsa to donate security equipment to foreign airports with direct flights to the united states. the approved provisions would also order a new u.s. assessment of foreign cargo security programs and provide grant money to train state, local and foreign authorities in how to respond to mass casualty and “active shooter” incidents. it is unclear what kind of reception the faa bill, if passed by the senate, might receive in the house of representatives. house lawmakers have been considering their own faa legislation. that bill also calls for the privatization of the u.s. air traffic control system, a measure that is not in the senate’s legislation.

" the united states suggested on tuesday it could cut u.s. aid to pakistan or downgrade islamabad’s status as a major non nato ally to pressure the south asian nation to do more to help it with the war in afghanistan. a day after president donald trump committed to an open ended conflict in afghanistan and singled out pakistan for harboring afghan taliban insurgents and other militants, u.s. secretary of state rex tillerson said washington’s relationship with pakistan would depend on its help against terrorism. “we are going to be conditioning our support for pakistan and our relationship with them on them delivering results in this area,” tillerson told reporters.  u.s. officials are frustrated by what they see as pakistan’s reluctance to act against groups such as the afghan taliban and the haqqani network that they believe exploit safe haven on pakistani soil to launch attacks on neighboring afghanistan. pakistan denies it harbors militants fighting u.s. and afghan government forces in afghanistan. tillerson said the united states could consider withdrawing pakistan’s status as a major non nato ally, which provides limited benefits such as giving pakistan faster access to surplus u.s. military hardware, if cooperation did not improve. “we have some leverage that’s been discussed in terms of the amount of aid and military assistance we give them, their status as non nato alliance partner   all of that can be put on the table,” he said. in a televised speech on monday offering few specifics, trump promised a stepped up military campaign against taliban insurgents who have gained ground against the u.s. backed afghan government and he singled out pakistan for harboring militants. u.s. backed afghan forces overthrew the taliban’s hard line islamist government in late 2001 because it sheltered al qaeda chief osama bin laden, architect of the sept. 11 attacks on new york and washington that year.  u.s. forces have been bogged down since in a war that has vexed three american presidents. about 2,400 u.s. troops have died there in america’s longest military conflict.   (for a graphic on u.s. troops and contractors in afghanistan click tmsnrt.rs/2xm6cxq)  the afghan government welcomed trump’s speech, but the taliban said it would make the country a “graveyard for the american empire.”     successive u.s. administrations have struggled with how to deal with nuclear armed pakistan, which has a porous border with afghanistan. washington fumes about inaction against the taliban, but pakistan has cooperated on other u.s. counterterrorism efforts, including against al qaeda and islamic state militants. the pakistani foreign ministry said it was “disappointing that the us policy statement ignores the enormous sacrifices rendered by the pakistani nation” in fighting terrorism.  “as a matter of policy, pakistan does not allow use of its territory against any country,” it said.      a senior u.s. official said on tuesday significant measures were under consideration, including possibly sanctioning pakistani officials with ties to extremist organizations. trump also called for pakistan’s great rival india to play a bigger role in afghanistan, a prospect that will ring alarm bells for pakistan’s generals.     “trump’s policy of engaging india and threatening action may actually constrain pakistan and lead to the opposite of what he wants,” said zahid hussain, a pakistani security analyst. the united states has little choice but to use pakistani roads and air corridors to resupply its troops in landlocked afghanistan, giving islamabad considerable leverage. u.s. officials fret that if pakistan becomes an active foe, it could further destabilize afghanistan and endanger u.s. soldiers.     defense secretary jim mattis said on tuesday he was awaiting a plan from the u.s. military’s chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, general joseph dunford, before deciding how many more troops to send to afghanistan. “when he brings that to me, i will determine how many more we need to send in,” mattis told reporters in baghdad. “it may or may not be the number that is bandied about.” u.s. officials have said trump has given mattis authority to send about 4,000 additional troops to add to the roughly 8,400 already in afghanistan. the u.s. air force may intensify its strikes in afghanistan and expand training of the afghan air force following trump’s decision, its top general told reuters on tuesday. most u.s. troops in afghanistan work with a nato led training and advising mission, with the rest part of a counterterrorism force that mostly targets pockets of al qaeda and islamic state fighters.

" ugandan authorities postponed a bill to extend leader yoweri museveni s rule after protesters took to the streets against it on thursday, confronting police who fired teargas. parliament speaker jacob oulanyah told lawmakers during a raucous session that the legislation due to be introduced on thursday afternoon was  bringing tension  and would come back on another, unspecified date. activists, campaign groups, religious leaders and even some members of museveni s own ruling party have objected to the proposed change to the constitution, saying it is undemocratic.      groups of students at makerere, a public university in the capital kampala, rallied to start marching toward parliament before police dispersed them with teargas. protesters regrouped through the morning, throwing stones back at police.  we are not going to allow anybody to hold protest marches. the teargas was to deter that,  police spokesman asan kasingye said. museveni, aged 73, has already been in power for more than three decades. the change to the constitution would have removed a rule banning anyone older that 75 running for president that currently bars him from running for re election at polls in 2021. the move to amend legislation mirrors similar tactics used in rwanda, burundi and the democratic republic congo to extend limits, a trend that has alarmed democracy watchdogs.  museveni won plaudits in the early years of his rule for restoring stability after years of turmoil, and became a key western ally who sent ugandan troops to fight islamist militants in somalia. but accusations of rampant rights violations, entrenched graft and dysfunctional public services have since fueled opposition to his rule.     police have also raided the premises of at least two pro democracy organizations in kampala, including that of the local unit of johannesburg based actionaid international.  security personnel blockaded staff inside their offices late on wednesday and conducted searches, staff members of the organizations told reuters.  there was intelligence that we got that they received funding for people who are planning to cause chaos and violence,  police spokesman kasingye said.  local media said kampala s mayor erias lukwago   an opposition party member   was detained early on thursday, though kasingye said he was unaware of the reports. museveni s bid has also met increasing denunciation from some members of the ruling national resistance movement (nrm) party, exposing cracks. the nrm counts about three thirds of all parliament members.  ultimately... museveni has ample patronage at his disposal and, when push comes to shove, few lawmakers will be prepared to risk political exile by not backing the president,  said charlotte king, a uganda analyst at the economist intelligence unit.  the u.s. embassy in kampala condemned the raids on pro democracy groups.   the united states is deeply concerned that recent arrests and raids stifle the ugandan people s right to free expression and tarnish uganda s global image,  it said in a statement.

" u.s. secretary of state rex tillerson asked saudi arabia to ease its blockade of yemen, two sources said, just days before the saudi led military coalition announced on wednesday it would let aid flow through the yemeni port of hodeidah and allow u.n. flights to the capital.  it was not clear if pressure from washington was the direct cause of the saudi change of heart but the request from tillerson to saudi arabia s crown prince, mohammed bin salman, was one of several u.s. attempts this month to have riyadh soften its hawkish foreign policy.  tillerson asked for a loosening of the blockade on yemen during a roughly 45 minute phone call at the beginning of this week, according to a source familiar with the matter who spoke on condition of anonymity. r.c. hammond, a top adviser to tillerson, confirmed the exchange with prince mohammed. the secretary of state  has brought the request to (the) saudis  attention several times over the past months,  he added.      the trump administration, according to u.s. officials and a european diplomat, also pressed the saudis to allow lebanese prime minister saad al hariri to return to beirut after he flew to riyadh on nov.4 and abruptly announced his resignation. the efforts to take the edge off saudi arabia s foreign policy reflect growing u.s. concern about riyadh s direction despite high profile attempts by president donald trump to improve relations with the longtime u.s. ally.              publicly, trump, his top aides and senior saudi officials have hailed what they say is a major improvement in u.s. saudi ties compared with relations under former president barack obama, who upset the saudis by sealing a nuclear deal with their arch foe iran. privately, however, u.s. diplomats and intelligence analysts   express growing dismay over riyadh s foreign policy, especially toward yemen and lebanon, as saudi arabia aims to contain iranian influence.      it is my understanding that the administration is frustrated. there has been of course varying degrees of frustration from different members of the administration,  u.s. senator todd young said of the situation in yemen.  young, a republican member of the senate foreign relations committee, spoke before the saudi led military coalition s decision was announced on wednesday.         the coalition, which is fighting houthi rebels, said it would allow humanitarian aid access through hodeidah and u. n. flights to the capital sanaa, more than two weeks after blockading the country to stop the flow of arms from iran. yemen, in civil war and under bombardment by a saudi led coalition, faces a deep humanitarian crisis and aid workers warn of famine if the blockade were not lifted.                   a senior saudi official told reuters that even before tillerson and prince mohammed spoke recently, senior white house officials had communicated to the saudi ambassador in washington the importance of taking those two steps.  they stressed the importance of addressing the humanitarian situation in yemen and we said that we understood and that the closures were temporary while we work on a comprehensive aid and access plan,  the official said. an administration official, speaking on condition of anonymity, confirmed that white house and national security council officials worked on easing the blockade with senior saudi officials, including prince mohammed and his younger brother khalid, the saudi ambassador to the united states.    much of the u.s. saudi relationship, multiple u.s. officials say, is conducted in a tight circle and led by trump s son in law and senior adviser, jared kushner, who has established a direct channel with prince mohammed. kushner  did not oppose  the pressure on the saudis and united arab emirates to ease humanitarian suffering in yemen, said one u.s. official. but the official added:  in no way does this change the position that jared and the crown prince evidently share that the main objective is reversing iranian influence in yemen and elsewhere.         on lebanon, the u.s. message to saudi arabia about hariri was conveyed in statements by tillerson and in private conversations between u.s. and saudi officials. those officials included the saudi state minister for gulf affairs, thamer al sabhan, who was in washington recently, a senior administration official said.  we ve encouraged...the saudis that it will be good for lebanon s political stability for hariri to return back to beirut as soon as is practical,  the official said last week.     hariri has since returned to lebanon and shelved his decision to resign as prime minister, easing a crisis that had deepened tensions in the middle east. top lebanese officials have said saudi arabia forced hariri to quit and held him in the kingdom. riyadh and hariri deny this.

" donald trump’s transition team on monday pushed back against an effort to recount nov. 8’s presidential election votes, calling the effort “nonsense,” but offering no evidence to back a weekend trump tweet alleging millions of illegal votes. with the clock winding down for voters and candidates to seek recounts in states across the country, green party presidential nominee jill stein requested a recount in pennsylvania on monday just hours before the state’s deadline. filing in pennsylvania three days after she filed a similar request in wisconsin, stein’s campaign said she would file a similar request in michigan by its deadline on wednesday. following trump’s stunning victory in the presidential contest, talk of recounts has swirled, with the republican president elect adding a surprise twist to the discussion. on sunday, trump tweeted that “serious voter fraud” occurred in california, new hampshire, and virginia, states won by his opponent, democrat hillary clinton. all three states rejected trump’s claim. the white house said on monday there has been no evidence of widespread election fraud in the presidential contest. still, wisconsin officials on monday prepared to launch a recount of the state’s more than 25 million votes, following stein’s request last week, a move that was joined by clinton’s lawyers. “if nothing else, this will give us a very good audit,” mark thomsen, the chair of the wisconsin elections commission, said on monday. “it’s going to reassure wisconsin voters that we have a fair system, that we’re not counting illegal votes.”  a statement on the wisconsin elections commission’s website said the recount was scheduled to begin on thursday and had to be completed by dec. 13. stein’s campaign has raised the money needed to pay filing fees for recount requests in wisconsin, michigan and pennsylvania. but she still aims to raise $800,000 more to cover fees for attorneys and other personnel needed to oversee the recount, said an official with her campaign. the official said any funds left over would be disbursed according to federal elections commission guidelines. california voters still could request recounts there. but the deadline for requesting a recount in new hampshire has already passed and the margin of victory in virginia was larger than what is necessary for a recount to occur, according to election officials in those states. new hampshire’s deputy secretary of state, david scanlan, said there was no evidence supporting trump’s claims of widespread voter fraud. “voter fraud does occur, but it occurs in isolated instances,” he said. california secretary of state alex padilla called trump’s allegations unsubstantiated and virginia commissioner of elections edgardo cortes said they were unfounded.

" blackstone group lp (bx.n) chairman and ceo steve schwarzman said on tuesday he expected to see a “very substantial reversal of regulations of all types,” for the financial sector, following donald trump’s u.s. presidential election victory. schwarzman, who was picked by trump to chair a panel of business leaders who will give him advice during his presidency, said the changes would boost u.s. growth and attract foreign investment. blackstone is one of the world’s largest investment companies. speaking at an investor conference hosted by goldman sachs group inc (gs.n), schwarzman said the regulatory changes would be the largest in his roughly 45 year career. he expects them to spur inflation and rising interest rates. trump has pledged to dismantle the 2010 financial overhaul known as dodd frank, and republicans in congress have already crafted legislation aimed at doing that. draft legislation from jeb hensarling, the republican chair of the u.s. house financial services committee would reorganize the consumer financial protection bureau, throw out the volcker rule restricting banks from making speculative investments and eliminate the authority of the financial stability oversight council to designate non banks as “systemically important.” schwarzman said rising interest rates would benefit blackstone’s lending businesses, while the outlook for its hedge fund and real estate businesses is less clear cut but generally positive. asked about corporate tax reform, schwarzman said any changes would need to apply to individuals as well as corporations because 80 percent of u.s. companies use a “pass through” structure in which business taxes are passed through to the personal income tax returns of the owners of the business.

" the u.s. state department will resume news briefings the week of march 6, a spokesman said on friday, breaking a silence under secretary of state rex tillerson that had caused consternation among american diplomats and contributed to confusion abroad about u.s. positions on key issues. the briefings, which in the past were televised and held daily, are watched closely by u.s. allies and adversaries for signals on american positions on major international crises and developments around the world. but they have been halted ever since president donald trump took office on jan. 20, a move that is unprecedented in at least the last three inter party presidential transitions, according to online archives of briefing transcripts. the last televised news briefing at the state department was held on jan. 19, the last full day of barack obama’s presidency. the question and answer sessions allow reporters to press spokespeople on the nuances of u.s. foreign policy and the actions of diplomats abroad. “the department will host press briefings beginning the week of march 6,” said mark toner, the state department’s acting spokesman. “we continue to be responsive to media queries and breaking news on an ongoing basis.” toner did not say if the briefings would be held every day, or if they would all be televised. in a statement earlier this week, toner said the briefings might be made available to reporters outside washington via remote video. top officials in the trump administration   including vice president mike pence, united nations ambassador nikki haley, homeland security chief john kelly, defense secretary jim mattis, and tillerson   have at times made conflicting or diverging statements from trump himself on issues including u.s. support for the nato alliance, support for the two state solution to conflict between israelis and palestinians, attitudes toward the news media, and the role of the u.s. military in immigration operations. the diverging messages have raised questions in foreign capitals over who actually speaks for the trump administration and which policies it will pursue. the silence from the state department during the tumultuous first month of trump’s presidency has also raised fears among current and former american diplomats that the department is being sidelined and is less able to help shape u.s. foreign policy.

" elvis norquay, a member of the chippewa indian tribe, has lived most of his 58 years on north dakota’s remote turtle mountain reservation and says he’s never had a problem voting. that was before 2014, when he hitched a ride with a friend to cast a ballot in local and congressional elections and was turned away. embarrassed, he asked why he couldn’t vote. he was told he lacked proper id under new state requirements. he has no phone, no current driver’s license and his tribal id lacks a street address. “when we left, my friend said, ‘that’s not right’,” said norquay, who has lived on disability since 2002 in a rural county near the canadian border. norquay is among a growing number of native americans embroiled in court battles over changes to voting laws that could influence the outcome of some tight races in the november 2016 presidential and congressional elections. while the native american population is small nationally, lawsuits involving tribes over voting problems have proliferated since the supreme court struck down parts of the voting rights act in 2013, a signature legislative achievement of the 1960s civil rights movement. north dakota is one of 17 states that have new voting restrictions in place since the last presidential contest, according to the brennan center for justice at the new york university school of law. many of these changes have sparked lawsuits and accusations that black, hispanic and other minority voters could be disenfranchised. five federal lawsuits involving native americans have been filed since the supreme court decision, including three this year alone. suits in north dakota, utah, south dakota and arizona claim new voting rules passed in majority republican states are discriminatory and could reduce voting by tribal members, who tend to back democrats. a suit in alaska, for example, claimed the state violated federal rules by failing to translate voting materials for tribal voters. the tribes say changes to voting rules in those states disproportionately affect native americans, an allegation the states and counties deny. the native american vote is not big enough to flip a safe republican state such as north dakota into the democrat column in this year’s presidential election, but native americans are a growing proportion of the population and a majority in some counties where increased voter turnout in recent years has tipped the balance in some congressional races. in many states, the number of native americans is growing faster than the population as a whole. between 2000 and 2010, the native american population rose by 26.7 percent to 1.1 million, compared to 9.7 percent growth in america’s overall population, census data showed. recent changes to voting laws, such as north dakota’s new voter id law, are part of “a much broader, deliberate, and concerted effort by republicans to reduce turnout among particular groups of voters on election day,” said pratt wiley, head of voter protection issues at the democratic party in washington. “those voters are more vulnerable today than they were before the supreme court invalidated a key provision of the voting rights act in 2013,” he said of native americans. republicans deny that voting law changes passed by republican dominated legislatures are discriminatory and say they are intended to reduce fraudulent votes. “these are popular common sense laws to protect elections from fraud,” said lindsay walters, national spokeswoman at the republican national committee. at issue in north dakota are revisions pushed largely by republican state legislators in 2013 and 2015 to a 2003 state elections law that eliminated a provision that had allowed people without proper identification such as norquay to vote if they were recognized by a poll worker or if they signed an affidavit swearing to their identity. norquay and six other members of his tribe sued the secretary of state in january in u.s. district court in north dakota. they said they were refused the right to vote in november 2014 because many old tribal ids such as norquay’s don’t list a current residential address.  it says some tribal members can’t afford a new tribal id or struggle to obtain proper identification because there are no state offices that provide driver’s licenses on the reservations.  richard mccloud, chairman of the turtle mountain band of chippewa indians, said widespread unemployment and poverty among tribal members meant that some struggle to afford the $10 needed to obtain a new tribal card.  “ten dollars is three pounds of hamburger and some macaroni for a family,” said mccloud at the tribe’s headquarters on the reservation of about 4,274 people a few miles (km) south of the canadian border. “maybe it’s no big deal if you work, but it’s a big deal to people that don’t have access to $10,” he said. north dakota’s secretary of state, al jaeger, the only defendant in the suit, said in an interview that the law is not discriminatory and simplifies the voting process in the only state in the country that does not require voters to register ahead of an election. he said his office has spent heavily on ad campaigns to educate voters about what ids are accepted. jaeger’s deputy, jim silrum, said the id requirements are not a barrier for the 97 percent of state residents with driver’s licenses, an accepted form of id, so the number of people affected by the changes is miniscule. those with no driver’s license, can get a non driver state id allowed at the polls from the motor vehicle department for free. jaeger and silrum said they could not respond directly to an assertion in the lawsuit that residents on reservations have to travel long distances to obtain a state id. republican state representative jim kasper from fargo repeated his party’s argument that the changes were aimed at reducing the risk of voter fraud, but silrum said there was little evidence of such irregularities. in the 2012 presidential election, there were only nine cases of people voting twice, but that was because they used the same id rather than a lack of proper identification, he said. state representative kylie oversen, a democrat from grand forks, said the changes could alter tight elections in favor of republicans. she said republicans pushed for the bill after heidi heitkamp, a democrat, was elected to the u.s. senate in 2012 by less than 3,000 votes. in sparsely populated states such as north dakota, with just 739,000 people, congressional elections have been decided by just a few thousand votes. rolette county, surrounding norquay’s reservation, is one of two counties in the state where about 75 percent of the population is native american. those two counties were the only places in north dakota that gave president barack obama more than 70 percent of the vote in 2012. after the changes in the id law were implemented in north dakota, voter turnout in rolette county dropped by more than 12 percentage points between the 2010 and 2014 mid term elections, more than any other county in the state, election data from the secretary of state’s office shows. “what has happened is the native american vote has become something that can tip elections,” said jean schroedel, a professor at claremont graduate university in california who studies native american voting. the native american rights fund, a non profit law firm representing norquay and other members of his tribe in the lawsuit against the state, plans to file a motion by june 30 requesting that the court invalidate the changes to the id law ahead of november’s election, according to court documents.

" president donald trump’s promised “big announcement” next week on overhauling the u.s. tax code, a top campaign pledge, will consist of “broad principles and priorities,” an administration official said on saturday. the president unexpectedly said on friday at a treasury department event that there would be “a big announcement on wednesday having to do with tax reform.” in a twitter message on saturday, he wrote: “big tax reform and tax reduction will be announced next wednesday.” asked for details, the administration official, who asked not to be identified, said, “we will outline our broad principles and priorities” on wednesday. trump has struggled as president to advance his domestic policy agenda, including on taxes, even though his republican party controls both chambers of congress. with his 100th day in office only a week away, he has yet to offer any formal legislation or win passage of a major bill he favors. most recent presidents had legislative wins under their belts by this time in their administrations. under u.s. law, only congress can make significant tax law changes, though the president often drives the tax agenda by offering legislation. the administration official said, “we are moving forward on comprehensive tax reform that cuts tax rates for individuals, simplifies our overly complicated system and creates jobs by making american businesses competitive.” as a candidate, trump raised high expectations in financial markets and the business community for changes in the complex, loophole riddled tax system. in his “contract with the american voter,” he vowed to work with congress on tax legislation “within the first 100 days of my administration.” the action plan promised large tax cuts for the middle class and businesses, a reduction of tax brackets to three from seven, simplified tax forms and an offshore profits repatriation tax holiday. since then, no legislation or formal tax plan has been presented by trump. he has at times expressed support for a plan drawn up by house of representatives republicans, but his views are unclear on a section that deals with taxing imports. in february, trump promised a “phenomenal” tax plan within a few weeks, without offering details. no plan followed. last month when an attempt supported by trump to repeal the healthcare law known as obamacare collapsed in congress, trump said he would refocus on taxes. treasury secretary steven mnuchin said on thursday he expected congress to approve a tax plan this year.

" president donald trump will seek to rebuild the u.s. relationship with egypt at a monday meeting with egyptian president abdel fattah al sisi focused on security issues and military aid, a senior white house official said on friday. “he wants to use president sisi’s visit to reboot the bilateral relationship and build on the strong connection the two presidents established when they first met in new york last september,” the official said, briefing reporters on condition of anonymity. egypt has long been one of washington’s closest allies in the middle east, receiving $1.3 billion in u.s. military aid annually. the country is fighting an islamist insurgency in sinai, and hundreds of egyptian soldiers and police have been killed fighting insurgents. the bilateral relationship was strained when former president barack obama criticized sisi for cracking down on the muslim brotherhood, egypt’s oldest islamist group. sisi does not make a distinction between the brotherhood, which says it is peaceful, and islamic state militants. egypt considers the muslim brotherhood a terrorist group.  obama froze aid to the country for two years after sisi, then a general, overthrew president mohamed mursi in mid 2013  after mass protests against mursi’s rule. mursi, a muslim brotherhood member, had been elected the previous year. human rights groups have estimated that at least 40,000 political prisoners have been detained by sisi’s government. trump’s relationship with sisi got off to a good start when they met last september in new york while trump was running for president, the white house said.  trump supports sisi’s approach to counterterrorism, which includes both military and political efforts, his efforts to reform egypt’s economy, and sisi’s calls for “reform and moderation of islamic discourse,” the official said. asked whether the united states would designate the muslim brotherhood as a terrorist group, as egypt has, the official said trump was interested in hearing sisi’s views during the meeting. “we, along with a number of countries, have some concerns about various activities that the muslim brotherhood has conducted in the region,” the official said. sisi’s visit comes as the trump administration has proposed massive cuts to u.s. foreign aid, the details of which are still to be determined. the white house anticipates aid to egypt will continue but provided no details on friday. “we’re in the budget process right now and those discussions are ongoing as to how it will be broken out,” the official told reporters. some u.s. lawmakers have opposed loosening restrictions on aid to egypt because of concerns about human rights in the country. the trump administration intends to address human rights issues behind closed doors, the white house official said. “our approach is to handle these types of sensitive issues in a private, more discreet way. we believe it’s the most effective way to advance those issues to a favorable outcome,” the official said. the official would not say whether trump would discuss with sisi the case of aya hijazi, an egyptian american who works with street children and was arrested in may 2014 on human trafficking charges. rights groups have called for her release. hijazi has been held in custody for 33 months in violation of egyptian law, which states that the maximum period for pretrial detention is 24 months. a verdict was set to be read in a march 23 court session, but was postponed with no reason stated by the judge until april 16. the maximum possible jail sentence in her case is 25 years. the white house is aware of hijazi’s case “at the most senior levels,” the official told reporters. “we are going to address this with egypt in a way that we think maximizes the chances her case will be resolved in a satisfactory way,” the official said.

" the united states is asking israel to temper its response to the u.s. recognition of jerusalem as its capital because washington expects a backlash and is weighing the potential threat to u.s. facilities and people, according to a state department document seen by reuters on wednesday.  while i recognize that you will publicly welcome this news, i ask that you restrain your official response,  the document dated dec. 6 said in talking points for diplomats at the u.s. embassy in tel aviv to convey to israeli officials.  we expect there to be resistance to this news in the middle east and around the world. we are still judging the impact this decision will have on u.s. facilities and personnel overseas,  the document said. a second state department document seen by reuters, which was also dated dec. 6, said the agency had formed an internal task force  to track worldwide developments  following the u.s. decision on jerusalem.  a u.s. official who spoke on condition of anonymity said it was standard to set up a task force  any time there is a concern about the safety and security of u.s. government personnel or u.s. citizens.  the state department had no immediate comment on either document. trump reversed decades of u.s. policy by recognizing jerusalem as the capital of israel, imperiling middle east peace efforts and upsetting u.s. friends and adversaries alike. the first document also laid out talking points for officials at the u.s. consulate general in jerusalem, the u.s. embassies in london, paris, berlin and rome and the u.s. mission to the european union in brussels.  in its message for the european capitals, the document asked european officials to argue that trump s decision did not prejudge so called  final status  issues that israel and the palestinians need to hammer out in any peace agreement.  you are in a key position to influence international reaction to this announcement and we are asking you to amplify the reality that jerusalem is still a final status issue between israelis and palestinians and that the parties must resolve the dimensions of israel s sovereignty in jerusalem during their negotiations,  it said.  you know that this is a unique administration. it makes bold moves. but it is bold moves that are going to be needed if peace efforts are finally going to be successful,  it said. the status of jerusalem, home to sites holy to the muslim, jewish and christian religions, is one of the biggest obstacles to reaching an israeli palestinian peace deal. israel considers jerusalem its eternal and indivisible capital and wants all embassies based there. palestinians want the capital of an independent state of their own to be in the city s eastern sector, which israel captured in the 1967 middle east war and annexed in a move never recognized internationally.

"with a growing number of muslim refugees and immigrants living in america who are strict adherents of sharia law, it should come as no surprise that female genital mutilation is not so uncommon anymore in many parts of the united states. it is a felony to perform a clitorectomy on a female in america, but getting caught is the hard part a petition from the womens  group equality now reveals that immigration has put the united states on a list that will be much more difficult for progressive immigration enthusiasts to cheer. a massive influx of immigrants from muslim-populated countries in africa and the middle east has led the group to conclude that more than half a million girls in the u.s. are in danger of having their exposed sexual organs skinned from their bodies.the practice is known as female genital mutilation (fgm).the atlantic describes how the procedure is carried out:it usually involves the complete removal of the clitoris, and often the removal of some of the inner and outer labia. in its most extreme form infibulation almost all the external genitalia are cut away, the remaining flesh from the outer labia is sewn together, or infibulated, and the girl s legs are bound from ankle to waist for several weeks while scar tissue closes up the vagina almost completely. a small hole, typically about the diameter of a pencil, is left for urination and menstruation. the cutting is usually done with a razor, a kitchen knife, or a pair of scissors. it is rare for any anesthesia to be used.as the united states continues to mail out immigrant visas to countries with hostile and violent attitudes towards women, it will increasingly challenge americans  self-perception of what it means to live in a first world country.haha dukureh, an fgm-survivor and founder of the activist organization safe hands for girls, warned that  every year thousands of girls here in the united states go through female genital mutilation.   breitbart newsa gwinnett county muslim man was deported today after female  serving 10 years in an american prison (on the american taxpayer dime) for a genital mutilation sentence. an ethiopian man convicted of aggravated battery and cruelty to children was removed from the united states on monday.khalid adem, 41, was arrested for using scissors to mutilate the genitals of his 2-year-old daughter.he was deported on monday after serving 10 years in prison.adem was an ethiopian citizen and native when he was living in gwinnett county, georgia in 2006.

" u.s. republican and democratic senators said tuesday they want to slap a wide range of sanctions on russia over its cyber activities and actions in syria and ukraine, and force president donald trump to formally waive them if he has objections. ten senators   republicans john mccain, lindsey graham, marco rubio, ben sasse and rob portman and democrats ben cardin, robert menendez, jeanne shaheen, amy klobuchar and richard durbin   introduced the legislation and said they hoped to add more sponsors and push senate leaders to allow a vote. a sanctions bill with similar provisions is being written in the house of representatives, led by democrats eliot engel, the foreign affairs committee ranking member, and gerald connolly, a panel member. the measures could set up a showdown with the administration of trump, a republican who takes office on jan. 20 and has repeatedly praised russian president vladimir putin and criticized intelligence officials for findings linking him to attempts to influence the 2016 presidential election.  the senate bill was introduced a day before the senate foreign relations committee holds its confirmation hearing for trump’s nominee to be secretary of state, rex tillerson, who worked for years with putin’s government as chief executive of exxon mobil. cardin, the panel’s top democrat, said tillerson would be questioned about whether he would support the sanctions. “this is about protecting the security of america,” he told a news conference. the bill would impose visa bans and freeze the assets of people “who engage in significant activities undermining the cyber security of public or private infrastructure and democratic institutions” or those who aid such activities. it would also impose sanctions on those who engage with the russian defense or intelligence sectors, which could affect international companies doing business with russia. it also puts into law sanctions on russia that president barack obama imposed via executive order late last month. u.s. lawmakers have long called for a tougher response to russian annexation of ukraine’s crimea region and intervention in the syrian civil war on behalf of syrian president bashar al assad. their impatience has increased since intelligence agencies released a report friday saying putin ordered a campaign to try to sway the 2016 u.s. election in trump’s favor. “we have to respond to vladimir putin’s behavior and if we don’t, he will continue unchecked,” mccain said. the bill also sets new sanctions over ukraine and syria, including putting into law four executive orders from the obama administration sanctioning russia over its actions in ukraine. among other things, it would mandate sanctions on large investments in russia’s ability to develop its petroleum and natural gas resources. it would let the president waive the sanctions, but only if he certified that russia is making progress on complying with international agreements and improving its record on human rights. graham said he would push senate majority leader mitch mcconnell to allow the measure to come up for a vote, predicting strong bipartisan support in the senate. senate democratic leader chuck schumer announced he supports the bill. “i’m not going to let 2017 go by and not challenge what russia did. this is the best way to challenge them,” graham said. a mcconnell spokesman responded only that he had no scheduling updates. lawmakers from both parties have raised questions about the decades tillerson spent working with russia’s government as an executive at the oil company, his ties to putin and past criticism of u.s. sanctions on russia.

" democrat richard cordray delivered a campaign style stump speech at a sprawling labor day celebration on monday, but the u.s. consumer financial protection bureau chief stopped short of saying whether he intends to run for governor of ohio. if cordray were to step down to run for political office it would allow president donald trump to appoint a successor as head of the consumer watchdog agency, which has stoked the ire of wall street with steep penalties for misconduct and tougher rules on lending. “we need to join together to help each other rekindle the hope, the enthusiasm, and the willingness to find and make our own opportunities,” cordray said to hundreds of union members, a key democratic constituency, at an afl cio picnic in cincinnati. cordray is the first director of the cfpb, a consumer watchdog agency created under former president barack obama in the aftermath of the 2007 2009 financial crisis. an ohio native, he has been widely expected to jump into the race for governor and clearly appeared to be testing the political waters with his speech on monday. though many had speculated he would use the occasion to   announce his candidacy, activists and political leaders said any formal announcement about cordray’s plans to enter the 2018 contest would wait until the cfpb finalizes a long awaited rule restricting the activity of payday lenders. current ohio governor john kasich, among more than a dozen republican candidates to be defeated by trump in last year’s presidential primary campaign, is barred by term limits from running again in the pivotal election battleground state. as cfpb director, cordray has rained down steep penalties on banks, auto dealers, student lenders and credit card companies for alleged predatory lending practices. his reputation as being tough on banks and sticking up for consumers has many democrats saying he is their best hope for taking the governors mansion, and chipping away at republicans’ dominance in state government.  due to a law forbidding public officials from using their office to advance political campaigns, cordray would have to resign to run for governor. his term does not expire until next summer, when democrats will already have selected their gubernatorial nominee in primary elections. members of both parties have said trump would seize on a vacancy at the top of the cfpb to make good on campaign promises to slash regulations and weaken or perhaps even dismantle the agency. republicans have long fought to take the agency apart, saying it oversteps its authority and that the single director, who both writes and enforces rules, has too much power. the agency itself has repeatedly declined to comment on cordray resignation rumors. cfpb critics say trump could use a 1998 law to slide in a current administration appointee, already confirmed by congress, as temporary director if cordray resigns. a legal ruling that trump can fire cordray is currently under appeal. “he’s done a great job and i don’t think he should leave for  any reason,” said karl frisch, executive director of the liberal group allied progress.

"the department of homeland security announced its plans to build a 15-mile prototype of the border wall in san diego.the department issued a waiver from numerous environmental laws and regulations to build the wall with  robust physical characteristics  to prevent illegal immigration crossings in an area of  high illegal entry. the department is implementing president trump s executive order 13767, border security and immigration enforcement improvements, and continues to take steps to immediately plan, design, and construct a physical wall along the southern border, using appropriate materials and technology to most effectively achieve complete operational control of the southern border,  the department said in a statement tuesday announcing plans to issue the waiver.in one of his last moves as dhs secretary, gen. john kelly signed the notice on july 26, before he was tapped to serve as white house chief of staff.the waiver was published in the federal register on wednesday.the notice outlines the plans for projects along a 15-mile stretch along the southwestern border in the san diego sector. the department said the area is in need of further border protection immediately, as it is the site of over 31,000 illegal alien apprehensions, the seizure of 9,167 pounds of marijuana, and approximately 1,317 pounds of cocaine last year alone. the construction of border wall prototypes in the project area and the robust physical characteristics that are to be incorporated into the border wall prototypes are intended to deter illegal crossings,  the notice states.the department will waive several environmental regulations to build the prototype wall, including the national environmental policy act, the endangered species act, the clean water act, and a host of others.dhs said it is still committed to safeguarding the environment but is eliminating onerous rules that would delay construction.for entire story: washington free beacon",1
" president donald trump and top aides have urged conservative republicans in congress to craft legislation protecting “dreamers” brought illegally to the united states as children, a move that could jeopardize efforts to work with democrats on the issue. trump, vice president mike pence, white house chief of staff john kelly and other officials have reached out to more than a dozen republicans, including some of the loudest anti immigration voices in congress. the consultations followed a dinner trump held earlier this month with the top two congressional democrats, senator chuck schumer and representative nancy pelosi. the president discussed with the two democrats legislation to shield from deportation roughly 800,000 young immigrants known as dreamers. in comments that angered trump’s conservative political base, white house officials said trump would not necessarily insist on funding for a wall on the u.s. mexico border as a condition for helping the dreamers. trump’s pledge to build a border wall was a central theme of his 2016 presidential campaign. earlier this month, trump rescinded an obama era program that shielded dreamers from deportation, but gave the republican controlled congress   long gridlocked over immigration   six months to come up with legislation to address the issue. the recent consultations with republicans included a dinner that pence hosted for a group of conservative lawmakers at his residence. republican representative mark walker, who attended the dinner with pence, said the administration was delivering a stark warning: trump wants conservatives to participate in offering ideas for a dreamer bill. if they do not, they will be frozen out of the discussions. walker, chairman of the conservative republican study committee, said white house officials had made clear that trump was willing to work with democrats and moderate republicans on a dreamer bill if that was the only option. the outreach to conservatives suggests the administration is trying to minimize the potential backlash from trump’s base over the dreamer issue. many conservatives staunchly oppose protection from deportation for any illegal immigrants, viewing it as a form of amnesty. but any effort to bring conservatives on board with legislation could alienate democrats. among other republicans who have been contacted by the administration are house judiciary committee chairman bob goodlatte, representative steve king and senator tom cotton, who have pushed hard for strict immigration limits and tougher law enforcement. the white house said administration officials had also reached out to other republicans, like representative mario diaz balart, who in the past participated in negotiations on immigration reform. a white house official told reuters that in conversations with republicans, the administration was offering “principles” for dreamer legislation that included building the border wall and expanding the use by companies of the “e verify” system to check the legal status of new hires. both are initiatives democrats strongly oppose. republican representative mark meadows, chairman of the hard line conservative house freedom caucus, said there had been “ongoing conversations” between lawmakers and the administration. he added members of his caucus were looking at ideas for an immigration bill. a senior democratic aide said democratic leaders were awaiting an offer from the white house that would build on trump’s mid september agreement to collaborate on a dreamer bill. the aide said democrats “look forward” to engaging trump on a border security package sketched out at the dinner with the president, which did not include most of the conservative ideas now being floated in congress.

" virginia officials started recounts on wednesday in the first of four state house of delegates races, a process that could lead to a democratic takeover of the chamber after the party’s historic election gains last month. republicans have a narrow 51 49 majority in the house after democrats erased a two to one advantage in november, part of the party’s first big wave of victories since republican donald trump won the white house last year. four of the legislative races were close enough to lead to recounts. if democrats gain one seat in the house, the chamber would be tied 50 50 with no tiebreaking mechanism. governor elect ralph northam is a democrat, and republicans hold a 21 19 edge in the state senate. the first recount was scheduled for wednesday and thursday in suburban washington’s district 58, where republican incumbent tim hugo narrowly won re election by 106 votes over democrat donte tanner. others are planned for next week, including one where the republican leads by only 10 votes. in a recount set for dec. 21 in northern virginia’s district 28, democrat joshua cole trails republican robert thomas by 82 votes. the state elections board has said at least 147 voters were assigned to the wrong district, and voters have filed a federal lawsuit to hold a new election. andrea gaines, a state elections spokeswoman, said in an email that she had no information on when results for the recounts would be announced.

" thai authorities have arrested a local tour guide for indecent behavior at a temple after she posted a photograph online that showed her standing on a pagoda, police said on saturday. the arrest came as photographs of naranon narakamin 44  circulated on social media earlier in the week, including one that showed her standing behind a tourist with one of her foot placed on a pagoda at bangkok s iconic temple of dawn. it is unclear when the photograph of naranon was taken but it has outraged many conservatives who say her behavior was  disrespectful to buddhism. tourist police deputy commissioner police major general surachet hakpal told a press conference on saturday that the tour guide has exhibited  inappropriate behavior at a buddhist temple,  and set a bad example for thais and foreign tourists.  naranon, who has publicly apologized for her action, will be charged with breaching the national archaeological site act and could face up to one month jail term and a fine of up to 10,000 baht ($307.50), the police said. in thailand, using feet to point at people or objects, particularly sacred objects is considered very rude. revealing clothing and inappropriate action at places of worship is also considered offensive in the predominantly buddhist country. last month two american tourists were arrested and fined for public indecency after posing for a  butt selfie  at a temple in bangkok.

" qatar s defense minister has signed a letter of intent to purchase 24 typhoon jets from british defense group bae systems, in a move that could anger other gulf countries boycotting doha. saudi arabia, the uae, egypt and bahrain cut diplomatic and trade links with qatar on june 5, suspending air and shipping routes with the world s biggest exporter of liquefied natural gas, which is home to the region s biggest u.s. military base.  the letter of intent includes the ministry s intention to purchase 24 modern typhoon aircraft with all their equipment,   state news agency qna reported on sunday. the agreement was signed by minister of state for defence affairs khalid bin mohammed al attiyah and his british counterpart michael fallon, qna added.     this will be the first major defense contract with qatar, one of the uk s strategic partners,  britain s ministry of defence said in a statement, adding that talks over a deal had taken several years.  we also hope that this will help enhance security within the region across all gulf allies.  the eurofighter typhoon is a joint project between bae, france s airbus  and italy s finmeccanica [sifif.ul] and supports an estimated 40,000 jobs in britain. neither statement gave the cost of the combat jet deal. bae had agreed in 2014 to supply saudi arabia with 72 typhoon jets in a deal worth 4.43 billion pounds ($6 billion). fallon told a conference in london, on saturday, the british government will step up efforts to help bae systems to sell more typhoon jets with government to government deals. the typhoon has attracted fewer orders this year than the rival rafale built by france s dassault aviation , which has agreed deals with egypt and qatar. qatar also signed a deal in june to buy f 15 fighter jets from boeing co in the united states for $12 billion and concluded a 5 billion euro ($6 billion) deal with italy for seven navy vessels. the wealthy gulf state has been accused by its neighbors of supporting terrorism and meddling with iran, saudi arabia s arch rival in the region. qatar denies the accusations. the crisis has put the region on edge and prompted turkey to send troops to doha in a sign of support.

" former president barack obama used a rare public appearance on wednesday to question republicans’ latest effort to repeal his signature healthcare law, saying it would inflict “real human suffering” on americans. in his speech at a bill and melinda gates foundation event in new york city, obama also laid out an optimistic vision of the world’s future while implicitly criticizing republican president donald trump’s “america first” philosophy. the remarks were one of the few times that obama, a democrat, has spoken publicly since he left office in january. “it is aggravating,” obama said of the republican attempt to eliminate obamacare. “it’s certainly frustrating to have to mobilize every couple of months to keep our leaders from inflicting real human suffering on our constituents.” but obama said the healthcare fight was a good example of the way that advancement is often made: through fits and starts, with backward steps tempering every success. “progress is never inevitable,” he said. “it can often be fragile; it’s in need of constant renewal.” the true test, he said, was in how people respond in times of difficulty, when their efforts to make the world better run into resistance. “your response has to be to reject cynicism and reject pessimism and to push forward with a certain infectious and relentless optimism,” he said. “not blind optimism, not one that ignores the scale and the scope of challenges, but that hard earned optimism that is rooted in the stories of very real progress that have occurred throughout human history.” the speech came a day after trump addressed the united nations general assembly for the first time as president, offering a full throated defense of nationalism and expressing skepticism about multilateral foreign policy. during a question and answer session with bill and melinda gates after his speech, obama said the united states cannot hope to solve the world’s biggest problems, such as climate change or mass migration, on its own. as he has largely done since leaving office, obama did not mention trump by name, but he made it clear that he disagreed with the president’s viewpoint. “you don’t have to cede your sovereignty or it doesn’t make you less patriotic to believe that,” obama said. “you just have to have some sense   and read.” ",0

" fashion models who want to work in california would need a doctor to attest that they are of healthy weight and not suffering from an eating disorder under a proposal announced by a state lawmaker on monday. the bill proposed by california state assembly member marc levine follows efforts in several countries to fight anorexia nervosa and other eating disorders among models, who are relentlessly pressured to lose weight or lose work. “the evidence of eating disorders in the modeling industry is alarming,” levine, a democrat who represents the marin county suburbs of san francisco, said in a statement on monday. under his bill, which was introduced feb. 19, modeling agencies would have to be licensed by the california labor commissioner, and could be fined if they hire models who do not have a physician certifying that they are healthy. the bill, if passed, directs the state’s department of public health and the occupational safety and health standards board to adopt rules for the health of fashion models that would include periodic health checkups, nutrition consultations and medical testing. levine said the measure, which must pass numerous committees, both houses of the legislature and be signed by democratic governor jerry brown before it could take effect, would also help girls and women, who see impossibly thin models in magazines and aim to be like them. “as a former fashion model and an eating disorder survivor, i know that this legislation is critically needed,” nikki dubose, a former model turned advocate, said in a statement. last spring, france banned excessive thinness in models, partly in response to the death in 2010 of isabelle caro, a 28 year old former french fashion model who died from anorexia after posing for a photographic campaign to raise awareness about the illness. israel enacted a similar measure in 2013, while other countries, like italy and spain, rely on voluntary codes of conduct to protect models. as many as 40 percent of fashion models may suffer from eating disorders, levine said. these include anorexia nervosa, which leads sufferers to starve themselves; bulimia nervosa, which involves binge eating followed by purges such as forced vomiting, consumption of laxatives or excessive exercise; and binge eating disorder.

" libyan authorities are attempting to negotiate with a group that has cut water supplies to the libyan capital for the second time in two months to press for the release of a jailed ally, an official said on tuesday. the group shut down pipes pumping water to tripoli and other coastal towns at the al hasawna well system south of the capital, said tawfiq shwehaidi, a manager at the great man made river in the eastern city of benghazi.  today is the fifth day in a row that the water has stopped and we are trying to negotiate with them,  he said.  the group, loyal to late former leader muammar gaddafi, is demanding the release of mabrouk ehnaish, a militia leader detained last month by tripoli s special deterrence force (sdf), which is aligned with libya s u.n. backed government. ehnaish s backers have made various threats to sabotage infrastructure including oil and gas supplies, and in october blocked water supplies to the capital for about two weeks.  the great man made river is a pipeline system built under gaddafi that pumps water to coastal areas from underneath the country s southern desert. the water cuts come as libyans struggle to cope with a steep decline in living standards during the conflict that developed after gaddafi s 2011 overthrow, and an economic crisis that has led to rapid inflation and severe cash shortages. in recent days there have also been long queues for fuel and cooking gas in tripoli. though distributors have denied any shortages, some residents nervous about disruption to supplies have queued for more than an hour to fill vehicles or jerry cans.

" dna tests on the exhumed body of salvador dali showed that a spanish woman who brought a paternity suit against him was not his daughter, the surrealist painter s foundation said on wednesday. the court supervising the tests had informed its lawyers that maria pilar abel was not dali s biological daughter after comparing her dna with samples taken from his remains, the foundation said in a statement. a spokesman for the court declined to confirm the results of the tests. contacted by phone, abel said she had not yet received the results from the court. the madrid court in june ordered forensic scientists to exhume dali s body after abel, who was born in dali s home town of figueres, filed a paternity claim that alleged her mother had an affair with him.  this conclusion is not a surprise for the foundation, since at no point has there been any evidence that she was a relative,  said the foundation, which manages dali s estate.  the foundation is happy that this puts an end to an absurd and artificial controversy.  dali, who died in 1989 aged 84, was one of the 20th century s most famous and easily recognized artists. his paintings include  the persistence of memory , with its iconic images of melting clocks, and he also turned his hand to movies, sculpture and advertising.

" former mexican first lady margarita zavala, a leading contender to become president herself, said on friday she was breaking with her party, deepening divisions in the opposition ahead of the 2018 presidential election. zavala, wife of former president felipe calderon, announced her decision to leave the center right national action party (pan) in a recorded video broadcast in which she attacked the party leadership for blocking her aspirations. since launching her bid for the presidency in june 2015, zavala has spent months as one of the top contenders in opinion polls, generally just behind former mexico city mayor andres manuel lopez obrador, a veteran leftist with nationalist leanings. the election will be held in july 2018, and president enrique pena nieto s institutional revolutionary party (pri) faces an uphill struggle to stay in power. polls show a tight race, though most candidates have yet to be chosen. zavala, 50, said she quit the pan because the party base had been subordinated to the interests of its leadership, which has forged a cross party alliance for the election with the center left opposition party of the democratic revolution (prd).  anti democratic conditions took hold in the pan just like we had criticized in the pri and other parties,  she said. zavala told mexican radio that the  broad front  formed by the pan, the prd and the center left citizens movement party meant there would be no internal pan selection process for the presidential ticket, denying her a chance to be candidate. the pan has the most seats of any opposition group in congress. party chairman ricardo anaya responded with his own video message, noting the selection process was still open. saying he respected zavala s decision, anaya nevertheless argued her departure would only benefit the pri. a survey in august by polling firm mitofsky showed the cross party alliance coming first in a presidential vote with nearly 22 percent support, a few points ahead of the pri or lopez obrador s national regeneration movement (morena). however, over 37 percent of voters were still undecided.  running as an independent, zavala enters an increasingly crowded field of hopefuls that is due to include a maverick northern governor who broke with the pri in 2015. fernando belaunzaran, a leading prd advocate of the cross party alliance, said he regretted zavala s decision and that it would have been better to keep her inside the  broad front.  if polls later show zavala has little chance of winning, the front must be ready to welcome her back, he added.  we ve got to the keep the door open,  he said.

" new zealand will develop a close relationship with china, foreign minister winston peters said on tuesday, putting to rest fears that his protectionist campaign rhetoric would fuel tension with a key trading partner. the 40 year political veteran played a decisive role in bringing the centre left labour party to power in october after an inconclusive election left his nationalist new zealand first party holding the balance of power. but many in china see new zealand as a model for the asian giant s relationship with western countries, with president xi jinping last year calling the depth of the bond  unprecedented .  our record of trade and economic firsts is dramatic,  peters, who is also deputy prime minister, told academics and diplomats in wellington, setting out his stance on china for the first time since taking office.  new zealand will continue to seek closer cooperation with china as both countries focus on sustainable economic development and the wellbeing of our peoples,  peters said, giving a complimentary account of 45 years of diplomatic ties.    peters had campaigned on a protectionist platform, vowing to slash immigration and curb foreign investment, which fueled  concern he could anger the asian giant, the country s top destination for goods exports. on the previous national government s watch, new zealand became the first developed country to join the china led asia infrastructure investment bank and helped usher in other western countries, according to treasury officials. trade between the two countries has grown to more than nz$24 billion ($16.54 billion) a year and new zealand was the first western nation to formally sign up to china s sweeping belt and road global infrastructure initiative in march. the two are in the midst of negotiations to upgrade their 2008 free trade pact, which peters said would  serve as a demonstration to our shared commitment to trade liberalization . he also defended china s human rights record, which has at times drawn fire from rights groups.  when you have hundreds of millions of people to be re employed and relocated with the change of your economic structure you have some massive, huge problems,  peters said.  sometimes commentators in the west should have a little more regard to that, and the economic outcome for those people, rather than constantly harping on about the romance of freedom.  china s crackdown on activists and lawyers in its campaign to stifle dissent was  alarming , new york based human rights watch said in september.

" u.s. president barack obama’s foreign policy legacy rests in part on a foundation of unilateral actions that his successor donald trump could reverse with the stroke of a pen. due to take office on jan. 20, trump, the winner in tuesday’s election, campaigned at times to dismantle obama’s nuclear deal with iran and to reimpose sanctions obama eased on cuba. trump also disagreed with foreign policy decisions that included the way obama has deployed troops abroad to combat islamist militant groups. in his most notable foreign policy achievements, obama, a democrat, used executive authorities that offered a convenient legal path around a republican controlled congress committed to blocking his agenda. the u.s. constitution gives a president broad executive powers to enact foreign policy. both republican and democratic presidents have sought to exercise those powers by issuing executive orders, presidential memoranda and what are called findings. “he (obama) relied on executive authority to build a foreign policy legacy,” said thomas wright, director of the project on international order and strategy at the brookings institution.  “that is all vulnerable to countervailing executive authority by a trump administration,” wright said. obama had hoped to pass his legacy on to democrat hillary clinton, his former secretary of state, but she lost the presidential election to trump, a republican businessman who has never held public office or served in the military.  often contradicting himself during the campaign, trump made it difficult to know for sure what policies he would pursue. major constraints include budget caps, laws he cannot reverse without congress, and the pressure that will emerge to replace policies he chooses to abandon. trump said in an october speech that he would “cancel every unconstitutional executive action, memorandum and order issued by president obama” on his first day in office, without saying who would determine their constitutionality. a trump spokeswoman did not respond to a request for comment on thursday on his latest plans. perhaps nowhere has obama faced more congressional opposition than in his pursuit of the 2015 deal with iran, which republicans and some democrats said put too few restrictions on iran’s nuclear program in return for too much sanctions relief. trump has vowed to dismantle it, although his statements on the deal have been contradictory. a president may tighten and relax economic sanctions by executive order. “anything enacted by executive order can be rescinded by executive order,” said zachary goldman, a former u.s. treasury official now at new york university. obama drew enough support from democrats to block a republican led resolution rejecting the iran deal, achieving a political victory but falling short of a consensus.  trump will have the added advantage of working with a u.s. senate and a house of representatives controlled by fellow republicans. senate republican leader mitch mcconnell said on wednesday he hoped trump would “see how much he can undo the unilateral actions the president took all by himself, which would not require us.” breaking with longstanding u.s. policy on another issue, obama restored diplomatic ties with cuba in 2015. but facing opposition in congress to lifting a broad economic embargo, especially from republicans, he used executive actions to ease some u.s. sanctions. obama capped his cuba efforts last month with a sweeping  “presidential policy directive,” which also is reversible and sets forth mandates for government engagement, people to people exchanges, and greater u.s. business ties. trump has taken contradictory positions on whether he supports the embargo or not. obama’s aides said the easing of restrictions was aimed at securing enough benefits for u.s. businesses and travelers that it would be difficult, if not impossible, for any republican president to reverse the opening to cuba. trump could roll back obama’s efforts to create greater transparency about drone strikes. obama issued an executive order in july requiring annual disclosures about such strikes. as commander in chief, trump will wield the power to mobilize the u.s. military on short notice and without first seeking approval from congress. obama deployed u.s. troops to iraq, syria and libya to help fight the islamic state militant group by relying on the authority congress granted president george w. bush to battle al qaeda. that same authority would allow trump to ramp up u.s. deployments in fights against islamist militants if he chose to do so. one former u.s. intelligence official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the president can approve covert action and needs only to brief relevant leaders in congress once the operation is under way. trump’s powers, however, are limited. he pledged to expand the army, grow the marine corps, boost the navy from 276 to 350 ships and submarines, and raise the number of air force tactical aircraft from 1,100 to 1,200. for starters, that would require that congress scrap government spending caps under the budget control act. trump’s support for water boarding, an interrogation technique that simulates drowning, also would meet opposition. congress last year passed legislation barring the use of waterboarding and other “extreme interrogation techniques” widely considered torture. obama signed the measure into law last november.

"   enemies are unlikely to attack iran, especially on the ground, the country s military chief predicted on saturday, saying even  unwise  leaders in the west know that any such conflict would have huge costs for them. u.s. president donald trump, adopting an aggressive posture towards iran after its test launch of a ballistic missile, said in february that  nothing is off the table  in dealing with tehran, and the white house said it was putting iran  on notice .   in the remote case of an aggression (by enemies), this won t be on the ground because they would face brave warriors,  iran s semi official news agency tasnim quoted military chief of staff general mohammad baqeri as saying.  thank god, even the unwise who lead world arrogance (the west)... can conclude that attacking the islamic republic would entail heavy costs,  baqeri said at an air defense exhibition.  even if they would control the start of an aggression, they would not have a say about its end and they won t even be able to limit the war to iran s borders,  baqeri added. the united states imposed unilateral sanctions against iran last month after saying the ballistic missile tests violated a u.n. resolution, which endorsed a 2015 nuclear deal between tehran and world powers to lift sanctions. the resolution called upon tehran not to undertake activities related to ballistic missiles capable of delivering nuclear weapons, including launches using such technology. it stopped short of explicitly barring such activity. iran denies its missile development breaches the resolution, saying its missiles are not designed to carry nuclear weapons.

" brazil s president michel temer has agreed with congressional leaders to delay a key vote on pension legislation in the lower house until the week of dec. 18, the speaker of the body, rodrigo maia, said on thursday. the pension overhaul, a cornerstone of temer s efforts to reduce brazil s budget deficit, is seen by investors as crucial to boosting the nation s fiscal health. brazil s currency and benchmark bovespa stock index slipped on thursday amid concerns that temer lacked support to put the measure to a vote. if a vote were further delayed to next year, it could infringe on campaigning for elections due in 2018, a move most investors see as reducing the likelihood that the unpopular measure would be approved. the bill seeks to increase the age at which brazilians can retire and collect social security. it would also make pension payouts in brazil   some of the most generous in the world   more modest. temer has held a flurry of meetings in recent weeks with the heads of allied parties to whip the votes he will need to win the bill s passage and send it to the senate. among the carrots he has offered is increasing the size of the budget each legislator is given to spend on social projects in their districts. congressional leaders have said in recent days that the coalition supporting the bill is more organized than in weeks past. however, the government has not yet been able to secure the 308 votes the measure will need for passage.

" germany s departing finance minister expressed optimism that his country s democratic institutions were strong enough to withstand the arrival of the far right alternative for germany (afd) as the third largest party in parliament. wolfgang schaueble, who is due to step down as finance minister to become president of the bundestag parliament, told the newspaper bild am sonntag that afd s 90 odd elected lawmakers would be constrained by germany s constitution.  i d like to see more self confidence,  he told the newspaper in an interview published on tuesday.  our free, democratic system based on the rule of law is so strong that nobody can wreck it, neither from within nor from without. anybody who tries will fail.  the 75 year old conservative took his new job at the urging of chancellor angela merkel. her conservatives are trying to patch together a three way coalition with the greens and the pro business free democrats, who are expected to demand the position of finance minister. also, many in germany s mainstream felt a senior politician was needed to rein in the first far right party to enter parliament in 50 years. schaueble is germany s longest serving parliamentarian, and his stature is second only to merkel s in german politics.  but schaueble said he was ready to move on:  i decided before the elections after eight years as finance minister and many years  government responsibility to take on a new task.  he added he was confident that a three party coalition would be agreed, dismissing arguments about a formal cap on immigration as a  false argument . he defended merkel s 2015 decision to open germany s borders to over a million migrants fleeing war in africa and the middle east.  even our children will remember with pride the willingness to help that the germans showed during the refugee crisis,  he told the paper.

" both u.s. presidential candidates routinely criticize free trade deals they blame for the loss of american jobs. but tweaking the north american free trade agreement (nafta), as hillary clinton has pledged to do, or ripping it up, as donald trump demands, may do nothing to help companies like element electronics corp, which owns america’s last television factory.  winnsboro, south carolina based element, and the television industry more broadly, offer a window into the complexity of industrial supply chains and illustrate why pushing manufacturing jobs back to the united states is so difficult. element’s plant in south carolina is nearly identical to a rival factory operated by taiwanese conglomerate tatung company that sits on a dusty back street in this mexican border town. both import nearly all their components from asia. the parts often flow in through the same southern california ports. but there's a big, and costly, difference. the mexican plant, by sitting just over the border from el paso, texas, doesn't have to pay duty on those parts, even when the finished televisions are sold in the united states. but element's factory has to foot the tariff bill, which makes its televisions more expensive. (for a graphic on the trade loophole, click tmsnrt.rs/2ep5qmy ) “it’s pretty crazy that i’m disadvantaged for using u.s. labor,” says michael o’shaughnessy, element’s president. that’s a sentiment that trump, the republican nominee, has forcefully tapped as he makes the case that radically revamping the trade deal would level the playing field and bring jobs back. many trade experts, though, say it would be a costly disaster to try to unravel these production networks, which essentially treat mexico as a 51st state.  the peterson institute for international economics, a washington think tank that favors free trade, released a study last month that predicted imposing stiff tariffs on mexico and china would disrupt north american producers that have created global supply chains and push the united states into a recession. “the tv industry is characterized by particularly dense webs of cross border supply chains with mexico and china,” says marcus noland, the economist who directed the study. “there’d be chaos and a trade war.” even many who oppose nafta acknowledge it would be disruptive to suddenly erect barriers, given the way companies have shifted supply chains to integrate mexico. nafta, implemented in 1994, forged a common market between the united states, mexico and canada. in response, many industries, including television manufactures, have transformed themselves by creating supply chains that crisscross the border.  televisions once were produced in the united states and elsewhere with hundreds of parts, often tucked into elaborate wooden cases. a modern flat screen, by contrast, has relatively few parts, and more than 70 percent of its value is packed into the glass and the electronics integrated directly into the panel. the heart of the industry, including that core glass technology and production, is now based in asia. about half of all tvs imported to the u.s. come from mexico, says paul gagnon, an expert on the industry’s supply chain at ihs markit, an economic research firm.  “the main reason for that is so the producers can respond quickly to fluctuations in demand,” he says. tv sales are highly seasonal, spiking late in the year. in mexico, some of the factories double their workforce for just a few months to respond to this. gagnon doubts the jobs would come back to the united states, because margins on tvs are so low. “if there were any major cost increase (in mexico), you’d probably see some shift to asia for production — rather than seeing that production happen in the u.s.” some mexican plants mold the plastic casing and do other tasks in the assembly process. but in many cases — including at both the element and tatung plants — the assembly plants do mostly finishing touches like inserting printing circuit boards and tuning the units. this creates relatively few jobs compared to the kind of television manufacturing done in the u.s. industry’s heyday. in the 1950s, there were some 150 domestic television manufacturers in the united states, and employment peaked at about 100,000 in the 1960s. mexico’s cost advantage over the united state is formidable. o’shaughnessy said he pays his 200 workers, who operate in a converted shirt factory, about $15 an hour. the pay at the juarez plant is about $2.50 an hour. even with this edge, it’s getting harder to do the work in mexico, said chan hsing diao, manager of the tatung plant. (tatung doesn’t sell televisions under its own name, but rather is paid by other manufacturers to assemble their name brand products.) “the industry is consolidating and the cost pressures are enormous,” he said, noting that over the last six years, the amount he is paid to assemble a 32 inch television has fallen by half, from about $6 a unit to $3 a unit. “the profits are this,” he said, holding up two fingers almost touching. the tatung plant in juarez occupies a cavernous space that was once a windshield factory. it now features long assembly lines for televisions and produced 15 million tvs over the last seven years, diao said. some 13 million of those were sold in the united states. in january, the company lost its main customer, a chinese tv manufacturer that diao declined to identify. tatung is scrambling to find a new manufacturer that wants to build tvs for the united states. in the meantime, it continues assembling tvs for mexico and some other latin american markets. diao warned there would be a trade war if a new u.s. administration tore up the nafta agreement. with profits already so tight in mexico, many chinese producers might find it easier to ship finished goods directly from asia rather than move production and jobs to the united states, he said. o’shaughnessy, for his part, said he just wants to get the same break on import duties as mexico gets under nafta. his decision to build in the united states, he said, was driven entirely by his only customer for the u.s. plant, wal mart, which uses element as a centerpiece of its campaign to promote domestic manufacturing. the south carolina tvs are shipped in boxes emblazoned with american flags and bearing the words “assembled in the usa.” o’shaughnessy has appealed for a tariff exemption from his local congressman, rep. mick mulvaney, a republican. mulvaney said he is sympathetic but has been unable to win over many fellow lawmakers who consider special exemptions a form of earmarks for special interests, which many oppose on principle. “element makes clear the real world implications of these trade deals we have signed,” said mulvaney, adding that it’s time to “review” nafta to iron out this and other loopholes.    back in juarez, the annual ramp up of hiring is under way at the tatung plant to supply the surge of televisions bought over the holidays. employment at tatung goes as low as 280 each year, for instance, but is now on its way up to 600, diao said. “you could never do that in america — at least not easily,” he says, referring to this cycle of hiring and firing large numbers.

"actions have consequences:three russian billionaires are hitting back after they say they were defamed by the opposition research firm fusion gps. the russians  lawsuit says the dossier s assertions  falsely accuse  the three and alfa  of criminal conduct and alleged cooperation with the  kremlin  to influence the 2016 presidential election.  it says fusion recklessly spread the charges to journalists.fusion gps feels the karma:fusion gps, the producer of the infamous fake trump dossier, is fending off in court three of russia s richest oligarchs by painting them as corrupt bankers in bed with president vladimir putin.the three primary investors in moscow s alfa bank   mikhail fridman, petr aven and german khan   filed a libel lawsuit against fusion in october. fusion s dossier, written by former british spy christopher steele, says two of them engineered cash bribes to mr. putin. the dossier also implies that the bank colluded with mr. putin to interfere in the 2016 u.s. presidential election by hacking democratic party computers.the lawsuit describes the three billionaires as international businessmen who became  collateral damage  in fusion s war to destroy the donald trump campaign. this is a defamation case brought by three international businessmen who were defamed in widely disseminated political research reports commissioned by political opponents of candidate donald trump in the 2016 presidential election cycle,  says a dec. 12 filing in u.s. district court for the district of columbia. the reports are gravely damaging in that, directly or by implication, they falsely accuse the plaintiffs   and alfa, a consortium in which the plaintiffs are investors   of criminal conduct and alleged cooperation with  kremlin  to influence the 2016 presidential election,  says the complaint by the new york law firm carter ledyard & milburn.fusion responded in court by relying on wikipedia and its press citations to paint a dark picture of three oligarchs who, the media say, capitalized on russia s freewheeling post-communism era to engage in financial scandals. fusion depicted the three as publicity-seeking financial titans who are public figures under u.s. law.unlike private citizens, public figures face a high bar in libel lawsuits. in this case, the russian businessmen, if deemed public figures, must prove that fusion spread the dossier charges with malice   meaning the opposition research firm knew its accusations were untrue or showed reckless disregard for the truth.three billionaires: mikhail fridman, petr aven and german khan are three of the most prominent oligarchs in russian history,  the fusion memo states.  with their incredible wealth and political power, each has had a pronounced influence on the economic and political affairs of russia.   any search returns an avalanche of articles about their business endeavors, their wealth, their political and economic power, their close relationship with the kremlin and their misconduct. at issue is mr. steele s september 2016 writings devoted to alfa (which he wrongly spells alpha), one of 17 memos making up the dossier from june to december 2016.he states that the alfa bank paid  illicit cash  directly from mr. fridman and mr. aven to mr. putin via oleg govorun, now a senior kremlin figure,  throughout the 1990s. mr. govorun s official resume states that he was an executive for alfa only from 1997 to 2000.mr. steele titled the september memo,  presidential election: kremlin-alpha group co-operation. read more: wt",1
" president donald trump will wrap up his visit to seoul on wednesday with a major speech on north korea and then shift focus to china, where he is expected to press a reluctant president xi jinping to tighten the screws further on pyongyang,  u.s. officials say. trump’s address to south korea’s national assembly will come a day after he seemed to take a more balanced approach: threatening to use america’s full military might against north korea if needed, but also offering it a diplomatic opening to “make a deal” to end the nuclear standoff. while trump presented no specific solution to his toughest global security challenge, his more conciliatory rhetoric toward north korea could help lower tensions between washington and pyongyang that have put much of the east asian region on edge over the prospects for military conflict. it contrasted markedly with trump’s earlier threats to “totally destroy” north korea if it threatened the united states, and the personal insults he exchanged with north korean leader kim jong un. it remains to be seen, however, whether the unpredictable trump, in his final day on north korea’s doorstep, will build  on this approach or return to the bellicose language that has characterized his handling of the north korean issue. trump’s official “talking points” for his asia tour show that he intends to use the speech in part to contrast south korea’s “amazing rise” with north korea’s “sad, backward  state” and to urge resolve against pyongyang, according to a confidential document reviewed by reuters. he is also expected to condemn pyongyang for its poor human rights record. trump will then fly to beijing where, according to senior administration officials, he will try to convince xi to squeeze north korea further with steps such as limits on oil exports, coal imports and financial transactions. previewing his beijing visit, trump told a news conference in seoul on tuesday that china and north korea’s other giant neighbor, russia, were among countries whose cooperation will be  crucial in getting north korea to rein in its nuclear and missile programs. “president xi … has been very helpful. we’ll find out how helpful soon,” trump said. but it is far from clear if xi, who has just consolidated his power at a communist party congress, will agree to do more. china says its leverage over pyongyang is exaggerated by the west, and points to its support in the u.n. security council for recent sanctions on north korea as evidence that it is doing all it can to curtail the isolated nation’s nuclear and missile tests. “on this issue, china’s position and stance is already very clear and staunch,” chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman hua chunying said on monday. “everyone can see clearly that we don’t need anybody to tell us what we should be doing.” but with trump appearing to crack open the  door to diplomacy with north korea – something that china has long urged – he may have a better chance of securing further promises to intensify economic pressure on north korea, which relies on beijing for more than 90 percent of its trade. north korean leader kim jong un, however, has seemed willing to risk snubbing china when he deems it useful as he pursues development of a nuclear tipped missile capable of hitting the u.s. mainland. at the same time, xi may be mindful that trump has held off on trade actions against china that he loudly threatened during the 2016 presidential campaign to give beijing more time to make progress on north korea. for his part, xi will also be looking to maintain the good personal chemistry the two leaders developed when trump hosted him at the mar a lago estate in florida in april. the “bromance” is set to continue when xi returns the favor by laying on a lavish welcome for trump’s visit starting on wednesday. trump is expected to go to the forbidden city, possibly guided by xi, and participate in an inspection of chinese troops, though china has released few other details.

" russia, turkey and iran are close to finalizing an agreement on creating four de escalation zones in syria, a senior russian negotiator said on thursday. the three sides are discussing details of the agreement at meetings in astana, the capital of kazakhstan, alexander lavrentyev, who leads the russian delegation, told reporters.  our main task at this international meeting on syria is to finalize and establish four de escalation zones,  lavrentyev said.  we are very close to reaching an agreement on creating these four zones.  the meetings, which also involve representatives of the damascus government and some rebel factions, will continue on friday. lavrentyev said the agreement was likely to include provisions on the deployment of monitors   such as military police servicemen   in the four zones and, more specifically, on their borders. the previous round of syrian peace talks in astana in july ended with no agreement after turkey raised objections. russia and iran, which back syrian president bashar al assad s government, and turkey, which supports some of the rebels, have been holding talks in kazakhstan since january and the meeting this week is their sixth.

" with a businessman turned politician now in the oval office, a small but growing number of bankers and wall street financiers across the united states have set their sights on politics. in new jersey, connecticut and california, former bankers, hedge fund managers and private equity executives have either announced bids for legislative and gubernatorial seats, or associates have told reuters they are considering running. meanwhile, industry trade groups including the american bankers association are launching formal programs to teach members in various states how to campaign successfully. it is not the first time well heeled candidates have entered american politics, and there are not a great number of them. but historians, political scientists and bankers say the atmosphere has changed abruptly under president donald trump. “it’s certainly raised the visibility of folks who in the past may have said ‘i’m not a politician,” said richard baier, president of the nebraska bankers association, which is launching a training school for potential legislative candidates. “we’ve shown that you don’t really need that background.” the oklahoma bankers association is also planning to launch its own candidate school, a spokesman said. foreclosures, job losses and growing income inequality after the 2007 2009 financial crisis made anyone with wall street ties into a political pariah. but trump, a self described billionaire who made a fortune in new york real estate and entertainment, has stocked his cabinet with wall street bankers and industry tycoons. his presidency has inspired others in the financial community to pursue civic duty, according to people who have studied campaigns or are involved with current election efforts. trump’s ascendance shows that candidates’ backgrounds matter less than whether they can connect with voters, said joshua sandman, a political science professor at the university of new haven. “trump running has encouraged more people in financial services to test the waters,” he said, “but the water could be murky for them unless they have a real set of positive experiences within business and are reflective of creating jobs and helping people.” it is hard to say quantitatively whether more candidates with finance backgrounds are pursuing political office now compared with prior election cycles. but paul herrnson, a political science professor at the university of connecticut who has researched candidates’ backgrounds, says he is skeptical about how successful the new crop of candidates will be. “sure, the mood is better than it was when the market collapsed, but i don’t think people say, ‘wall street financier – that’s someone i can vote for,” he said. phil murphy, the democratic candidate for new jersey governor in 2017, a former goldman sachs group inc executive who spent 23 years at the firm, is perhaps the most prominent moneyed candidate. his campaign has focused on bolstering the middle class with proposals to create a millionaire’s tax and launch other initiatives to help low income residents. murphy has won support from labor unions, environmental groups and consumer rights activists, as well as bold faced names in the democratic party like former vice presidents joe biden and al gore, who have both endorsed him. an oct. 3 monmouth university poll has him leading his republican rival, kim guadagno by 14 points, and over 60 percent of new jersey voters said murphy’s ties to goldman do not matter in a recent quinnipiac poll. “obviously goldman was his career,” said tony bianchini, spokesman for the northeast regional council of carpenters, which is backing murphy. “everyone has a career.” in connecticut, former ubs group ag executive robert stefanowski is running for governor, according to a public filing, and hedge fund manager david stemerman recently said he may do the same. the two republicans have given few clues about their campaign strategies other than to cast themselves as outsiders who can fix connecticut’s problems. in california, two wall street veterans are mulling runs as progressive democrats. tom steyer, an environmentalist who worked at goldman sachs and was a hedge fund manager, may run for senate or governor, a person familiar with the matter said. joseph sanberg, a former tiger global management llc executive, is also considering a senate run, according to politico. he casts himself as a “progressive entrepreneur” on his website. other ex wall streeters who have entered politics have a mixed history, and much depends on how well their messages align with voters’ concerns, political historians said. for instance, while mitt romney’s private equity career helped doom his 2012 presidential bid, illinois voters elected private equity executive bruce rauner as governor in 2014.

" the parliament of australia s second largest state passed legislation on friday to allow terminally ill patients to seek medical help to end their lives, a bill that is expected to act as a catalyst for the rest of the country to adopt similar laws. any resident of victoria state over 18, with a terminal illness and with less than 12 months to live can request a lethal dose of medication, the bill permits. anyone that is too ill to administer the dosage can ask for a doctor to help. many countries have legalized euthanasia or physician assisted deaths, including canada, the netherlands, switzerland, and some states in the united states.  but australia s federal government has opposed legalizing euthanasia even though the remote northern territory became the first jurisdiction in the world to do so in 1995.  the federal government enacted its own legislation to override the northern territory law in 1997 under rules allowed by the constitution. state law can not be overridden.  the passage of the bill in victoria is expected to herald assisted death legislation in other australian states.    it is a landmark moment. other states are likely to follow. we have seen this in other jurisdictions and i expect once politicians see how the system works, they will adopt similar models,  said ben white, director of the australian centre for health law research at queensland university of technology. the issue has divided lawmakers and medicinal professionals. victorian premier daniel andrews introduced the bill following his father s death from cancer in 2016. an opponent of the legalization, michael gannon, president of the australian medical association, which represents medical practitioners, said state law should not change because of the death of andrews  father. he later apologized for the comment. members of the state assembly debated the emotive bill through the night in a 26 hour session that ended with approval by 47 votes to 37. the legislation needs the approval of victoria s senate, though analysts expect it to pass into law. the legislation will not come into effect for 18 months to allow time to properly implement the assisted dying scheme.

" mexican billionaire carlos slim said on thursday that if  president elect donald trump succeeds in office, it will be good news for mexico, and that he would be more worried as an american than a mexican about the next u.s. government. slim, a telecoms tycoon who spent several years as the world’s richest man, says he has never met trump, but the two businessmen traded barbs during a bruising u.s. election campaign in which trump vowed to build a wall along the southern border to keep out mexican immigrants. in october, trump accused slim, the top shareholder in the new york times co, of trying to help democratic party candidate hillary clinton, even though slim’s shares have limited voting rights. then, a few days before the nov. 8 election, slim said trump’s plans could “destroy” the united states economy.     in his first public comments since republican trump’s stunning victory, slim said that trump’s plans could risk the international leadership role the united states plays. “i’d be more worried if i were american,” he said in an interview with bloomberg television. “if he’s going to close the economy ... if he’s going out of the nato and other international (bodies).” but slim added that trump’s potential success would also be mexico’s, arguing that a 4 percent u.s. growth rate and the creation of millions of jobs would benefit latin america’s second biggest economy. “that’s fantastic for mexico,” slim said at a bloomberg event in mexico city. mexico should turn its attention inward and invest to spur growth, slim said. he said trump’s win had not affected any of his own investment plans. still, slim also warned the audience about the effects of some of the protectionist measures trump has threatened to impose, including steep tariffs on mexican made goods. “to put a tax of 35 percent on our exports will be paid by (u.s.) consumers,” he said while speaking on a panel alongside bloomberg founder and former new york city mayor michael bloomberg. trump has said he would renegotiate or scrap a trade deal with mexico. trump attacked u.s. companies investing south of the border, battering mexico’s peso. “it’s not easy to build a wall, anyway they build tunnels and most people arrive by plane,” slim joked in comments before the election, referring to drug cartels digging tunnels to smuggle their products into the united states.

" illinois governor bruce rauner on friday vetoed a legislative fix favored by chicago mayor rahm emanuel for two of the city’s struggling pension funds and castigated it as a “kick the can approach.” the financial footing and credit ratings for the nation’s third largest city have slipped precipitously as its unfunded pension liabilities grew to $33.8 billion for chicago’s four retirement systems in the most recent accounting. the plan that passed the illinois senate unanimously in january and cleared the house overwhelmingly last december would have granted the state’s blessing to alter the city’s pension repayment schedule for its municipal and laborers’ retirement systems. the systems are projected to run out of money in the coming decade and were depending on legislative sign off of the city’s enactment of a water and sewer usage tax and telephone surcharge designed to help get them 90 percent funded in 40 years. city officials have acknowledged that more money will be needed starting in 2023 when payments will reach actuarially required levels. but rauner rejected the package, saying it created a payment schedule that eventually would necessitate a tax increase for chicago. he said it needed to be part of a broader, statewide pension funding strategy to address illinois’ $129.8 billion unfunded pension liability. “this is another kick the can approach to pension funding that landed chicago in fiscal crisis in the first place,” rauner said in a prepared statement. “this bill will create an unsustainable funding schedule that will lead to tax increases without solving the real problem.” a spokesman for the democratic mayor slammed the republican governor’s action as an “irresponsible and irrational decision.” “instead of helping secure the future of our taxpayers and middle class retirees, the governor chose to hold them hostage – just as he has done to social service providers, schoolchildren and universities across the state,” emanuel spokesman adam collins said in a statement, referring to rauner’s inability to broker a state budget deal for 21 months. rauner’s action left democrats with no ability to block his veto because the pension bailout passed in the previous session of the state general assembly, which ended in mid january, and the governor’s only options were to approve or reject the measure. but the city is pinning its hopes on an identical piece of legislation that passed the newly seated state senate in late january and is awaiting action in the house, collins said.

"a republican member of the electoral college representing texas, art sisneros, wrote on saturday that he will resign and turn his position over to an alternate elector. sisneros has previously been skeptical of throwing his support behind donald trump but now, he says he would rather resign than to vote against his conscience.in august, sisneros thought of participating as a  faithless  elector, but in a largely unnoticed blog post over the weekend he wrote that he cannot bring himself to vote for trump, so he decided to resign from his role as an elector, according to politico. the electoral college was corrupted from its original intent once states started dictating the votes of the electors,  he writes. if trump is not qualified and my role, both morally and historically, as an elected official is to vote my conscience, then i can not and will not vote for donald trump for president. i believe voting for trump would bring dishonor to god,  sisneros wrote.  the reality is trump will be our president, no matter what my decision is. sisneros said that he will  mourn the loss of our republic. since i can t in good conscience vote for donald trump, and yet have sinfully made a pledge that i would, the best option i see at this time is to resign my position as an elector,  sisneros continued.  this will allow the remaining body of electors to fill my vacancy when they convene on dec 19 with someone that can vote for trump. the people will get their vote   i will sleep well at night knowing i neither gave in to their demands nor caved to my convictions. i will also mourn the loss of our republic. this sounds similar to what ted cruz demanded people do. vote your conscience. but the texas senator lost his spine, soul and conscience during the eleventh hour, then threw his support behind trump. ted cruz is no art sisneros.____________________________________________________________________________________image via facebook.",1

" u.s. president elect donald trump’s transition team has issued a blanket mandate for politically appointed ambassadors installed by president barack obama to leave their posts by inauguration day, the u.s. ambassador to new zealand said on friday. “i will be departing on january 20th,” ambassador mark gilbert said in a twitter message to reuters. the mandate was issued “without exceptions” through an order sent in a state department cable on dec. 23, gilbert said. he was confirming a report in the new york times, which quoted diplomatic sources as saying previous u.s. administrations, from both major political parties, have traditionally granted extensions to allow a few such ambassadors, particularly those with school age children, to remain in place for weeks or months. state department spokesman john kirby said it was “common” procedure for all politically appointed ambassadors to step down as a new u.s. administration comes in on jan. 20. “all political appointees for the obama administration were directed to submit their resignation and the due date was dec. 7, and the resignations are to take effect on jan. 20,” kirby told reporters. “that is common, typical practise ... that’s the way it works.” kirby said, as expected, no career diplomats serving as ambassadors had been asked to resign by the transition team.  he acknowledged, however, that in the past there had been exceptions made for a small number of political appointees to stay on for a short time for personal reasons. “but that is totally in the prerogative of the incoming administration,” he added.  the order could leave the united states without senate confirmed envoys for months in critical nations like germany, canada and britain, the new york times reported. a senior trump transition official told the newspaper there was no ill will in the move, describing it as a simple matter of ensuring obama’s overseas envoys leave the government on schedule, just as thousands of political aides at the white house and in federal agencies must do.    trump has taken a strict stance against leaving any of obama’s political appointees in place as he prepares to take office on jan. 20, aiming to break up many of his predecessor’s signature foreign and domestic policy achievements, the newspaper said. diplomats told the new york times that the order has thrown their personal lives into a tailspin, leaving them scrambling to secure living arrangements and acquire visas allowing them to stay in their countries so their children can remain in school.

" democratic party presidential candidate hillary clinton does not need to give sworn testimony in a lawsuit brought by a conservative watchdog group over her use of an unauthorized private email system while she was u.s. secretary of state, a judge ruled on friday. clinton must instead respond in writing within 30 days to questions submitted by judicial watch, a group that has long been critical of her conduct and which is suing the department of state over clinton era records. judge emmet sullivan’s ruling in u.s. district court in washington is likely to be a relief to democrats, who did not welcome the prospect of clinton having to submit to hours of questioning by lawyers in the middle of her campaign for the nov. 8 election against republican party candidate donald trump.  clinton, who served as the country’s top diplomat from 2009 to 2013, has apologized for her decision to use the unorthodox email set up, which had the effect of shielding her communications from public records laws until the arrangement came to light last year. voters have said in opinion polls that the email server issue contributes to impressions that clinton is untrustworthy. the u.s. department of justice concluded last month there were no grounds to prosecute clinton for the arrangement following a year long investigation. sullivan has allowed judicial watch to obtain sworn testimony in sometimes testy exchanges with several clinton aides in recent months, saying the court needs to establish whether the server was set up to thwart the freedom of information act.  but the judge agreed with clinton’s lawyers that former high ranking government officials can be ordered to give sworn testimony only in “exceptional circumstances.” sullivan also allowed judicial watch to get sworn testimony from a former state department official named john bentel.  according to a scathing report by the state department’s inspector general, bentel, then a technology official in clinton’s office, told junior staffers to never speak of clinton’s email server again after they raised concerns. bentel and his lawyer have declined to comment on the episode. a spokesman for clinton could not immediately be reached for comment on friday. judicial watch said it was happy with the ruling. “we will move quickly to get these answers,” tom fitton, the group’s president, said in a statement. “the decision is a reminder that hillary clinton is not above the law.” ",0
" u.s. senate democrats on wednesday narrowly blocked legislation that would slow the entry of refugees from syria and iraq to the united states in a contentious vote cloaked in presidential election year politics. the vote was 55 43, with “yes” votes falling short of the 60 needed to advance the republican backed measure in the 100 member senate. no republicans voted against the bill, and only two democrats backed it. among other things, the bill would halt the admission of refugees and require high level u.s. officials to verify that each refugee from iraq and syria posed no security risk before being allowed into the united states. republicans said the tighter screening was essential to ensure the safety of americans and prevent attacks within the country by islamic state and other militant groups. “this bipartisan bill would allow washington to step back, take a breath and ensure it has the correct policies and security screenings in place,” republican majority leader mitch mcconnell said in the senate before the vote. democrats called the legislation an attack on people who  are fleeing war. they accused republicans of holding the vote to allow their 2016 presidential candidates serving in the senate to back legislation touted as tough on security. all three senate republican 2016 presidential hopefuls, ted cruz, rand paul and marco rubio, backed the bill. democratic presidential candidate bernie sanders missed the vote. democrats also sought to play politics. they tried and failed to reach a deal with republicans to set up a vote on an amendment establishing a religious test for would be immigrants. that vote was planned to see if republicans would side against presidential candidate donald trump, who has advocated barring muslims from entering the united states.   the syria refugee bill passed the house by a large margin days after the nov. 13 islamic state attacks in paris. the bill was supported by dozens of democrats who defied democratic president barack obama’s veto threat. “we need to talk about efforts to defeat isis, not creating more paperwork for cabinet secretaries,” harry reid, the senate democratic leader, told reporters before the vote. it currently takes 18 24 months for syrian refugees to be screened before they can move to the united states. washington has offered refuge to far fewer of the millions fleeing war in syria and iraq than many of its closest allies in europe and the middle east. obama announced last year that he would admit 10,000 syrians.

" u.s. president donald trump on monday issued an executive order revoking limits imposed by predecessor barack obama on the transfer of surplus military equipment to local law enforcement agencies, the white house said. obama had curtailed the equipment transfer program after law enforcement officers using military style armored vehicles and guns confronted protesters in ferguson, missouri, in 2014 following the fatal police shooting of a black teenager. trump’s executive order said, “all executive departments and agencies are directed, as of the date of this order and consistent with federal law, to cease implementing those recommendations and, if necessary, to take prompt action to rescind any rules, regulations, guidelines, or policies implementing them.” the republican president has reversed or cut back many of his democratic predecessor’s policies since taking office in january. the use of military equipment in ferguson prompted a wider outcry over the use of war fighting equipment by local law enforcement agencies in the united states. after a review, obama barred the military from transferring certain types of equipment to police or sheriff’s departments, including tracked armored vehicles, armed aircraft or vehicles of any kind, .50 caliber firearms and ammunition, grenade launchers, bayonets and camouflage uniforms. obama also required law enforcement agencies to justify the need for items like helicopters and other aircraft, wheeled armored vehicles, unmanned drones, riot helmets and “flash bang” grenades. “these restrictions that had been imposed went too far,” u.s. attorney general jeff sessions told a meeting of the fraternal order of police union in nashville, tennessee, earlier on monday. “we will not put superficial concerns above public safety. we will do our best to get you what you need.” sessions did not specify what those superficial concerns were. sessions said helmets and body armor available through the defense department program were the types of equipment that saved the life of a police officer during the 2016 orlando, florida, nightclub shooting. and helicopters and armored vehicles are vital to emergency and disaster response, he said. monday’s order drew criticism from some of trump’s fellow republicans in congress. “it is one thing for federal officials to work with local authorities to reduce or solve crime, but it is another for them to subsidize militarization,” senator rand paul said in a statement. paul promised to introduce legislation that would ban transfers of certain military equipment to local law enforcement agencies, improve transparency surrounding such transfers, and require the agencies to return equipment prohibited under the proposed law. u.s. representative mark sanford also condemned the executive order, criticizing the transfer program as a potential waste of taxpayers’ dollars. he said in a statement that he had introduced a bill in 2016 to auction off military equipment instead of give it to local agencies. the defense department’s law enforcement support program has transferred more than $6 billion worth of equipment to police agencies since its inception 25 years ago, pentagon figures show.

" the u.s. state department said on thursday it released $400 million in cash to iran under a tribunal settlement only once it was assured that american prisoners had been freed and had boarded a plane. “the payment of the $400 million was not done until after the prisoners were released,” state department spokesman john kirby told reporters. “we took advantage of that to make sure we had the maximum leverage possible to get our people out and get them out safely,” kirby added. it was the first time the administration has said publicly that it used the payment as leverage to ensure the prisoners were released by iran. three of the five prisoners, including jason rezaian, the washington posts’s tehran bureau chief; saeed abedini, a pastor from idaho and amir hekmati, a former u.s. marine from flint, michigan, as well as some family members, were part of a prisoner exchange that followed the lifting of most international sanctions against iran following a nuclear deal in 2015. one more prisoner, nosratollah khosravi roodsari, chose to remain in iran, while a fifth prisoner, american student matthew trevithick, was released separately.    both u.s. president barack obama and secretary of state john kerry have denied that the payment was ransom for the release of the prisoners or tied to the iran nuclear deal. the white house announced on jan. 17 it was releasing $400 million in funds frozen since 1981, plus $1.3 billion in interest owed to iran, as part of a settlement of a long standing iranian claim at the iran u.s. claims tribunal in the hague. the funds were part of a trust fund iran used before its 1979 islamic revolution to buy u.s. military equipment that was tied up for decades in litigation at the tribunal. the payment was made by the united states in cash due to international sanctions against iran. the administration has maintained that negotiations over the funds and the prisoners were conducted on separate tracks and were in no way linked. representative jason chaffetz, chairman of the house of representatives committee on oversight and government reform, has asked kerry to appear at a future committee hearing to discuss the payment.

" across libya s capital residents have started drilling through pavements to access wells in a desperate search for water after the taps ran dry in a new low for living conditions.  after years of neglect, workers turned off the water to do urgent maintenance earlier this month, cutting supplies to many tripoli households. then an armed group sabotaged the system, prolonging the misery.  the water crisis is a powerful symbol of state failure in a country that was once one of the wealthiest in the middle east but has been gripped by turmoil since a 2011 uprising unseated muammar gaddafi. for libyans the chaos has meant power cuts and crippling cash shortages. these are often made worse by battles between armed groups vying for control of the fractured oil rich state and its poorly maintained infrastructure.  we haven t had water for ten days. the state does nothing,  said nasser said, a landlord in tripoli s upmarket ben ashour district. already equipped with a generator to keep the power running during outages that sometimes last more than a day, he hired drillers to dig some 31 meters to extract groundwater for the six apartments in the residential block he owns.  no water, no electricity. you become a state in a state,  he said, standing next to his building on a leafy sidestreet.  we last had to do this maybe 20 years ago.  like many libyans, said is skeptical about the chances of u.n. led peace talks unifying rival factions that have been fighting for control. the talks were adjourned last week with little sign of progress in creating a government that could stabilize libya and stand up to armed groups that have repeatedly seized oil facilities and other state assets to make demands. the u.n. supported government of national accord (gna) has struggled to impose its authority since its leaders arrived in tripoli in march last year.  early last week an armed faction in the south said it had turned off water supplies from gaddafi s great man made river, a pipeline system that pumps water from underneath libya s vast southern desert to coastal areas such as tripoli.  the group is seeking the release of a leader imprisoned by a rival faction in the capital, said tawfiq shwehaidi, a manager at the great man made river based in the eastern city of benghazi.  we had started maintenance work on the 16th (of october) and cut supplies to tripoli,  he said.  afterwards an armed group... set one power plant on fire which closed three other plants and shut down 24 wells.   that has deprived residents of water while boosting the business of drillers who for 4,000 6,000 libyan dinars ($2,940 $4,410 at the official exchange rate) access groundwater unused in some neighborhoods since the great man made river started pumping water to tripoli in 1996.   we drill about three wells in two weeks   it takes about three to four days to drill a well,  said abdulsalam forganea, a 23 year old worker helping to operate an ageing drilling rig. parts of tripoli offer a semblance of normality and power cuts have eased since the summer. the city has seen fewer big clashes since a handful of armed groups aligned with the gna earlier this year. but security is still fragile. a former prime minister was abducted in august for nine days by one of the two most powerful armed groups, while the other engaged in a battle this month that shut down the airport. a reuters reporter recently saw a traffic clogged commercial street suddenly empty as a man was fatally shot by militiamen. kidnapping for ransom is rife. a conflict that escalated in 2014 has put extra pressure on a tripoli population that swelled to an estimated three million with the arrival of displaced families from other libyan cities. public health services are failing, inflation has spiraled, and the start of the school year has been delayed by several weeks because teachers are striking over salaries.  shutdowns crippled oil revenues so little has been spent on repairs and maintenance, and the water network and other infrastructure have been corroded. most government spending goes on public salaries, including for former rebel groups that forced their way onto the state payroll after gaddafi s overthrow.  no budget has been transferred... since 2011 except the emergency budget, which is the result of the financial difficulties experienced by the libyan state,  said naji assaed, head of the libyan water authority. production at desalination plants has fallen sharply, with output at a plant in the western town of zuwara dropping from 80,000 cubic liters to 16,000 cl annually. assaed said officials were working hard to resolve the crisis, but it was not clear when supplies would be restored. as he spoke a tanker arrived up to deliver

" east 4th street, emblematic of the new cleveland as a once downtrodden area turned trendy, is bustling ahead of the republican national convention. outdoor diners on the cobblestone restaurant row enjoy a glorious summer afternoon while cable network msnbc shoots its politically themed shows on the street.  just ahead of the four day convention that starts on monday, a festival of commerce and smiling faces takes place a few steps from the so called hard zone, delineated by a literal iron curtain that surrounds the sports arena where donald trump will be crowned the republican presidential candidate. “ten years ago, this place was a dump. a wasteland,” said john lusk, 70, a semiretired publisher of a newsletter. “a group of young, hardworking entrepreneurs came in and look what they did.”    the sunny celebration butts uncomfortably against a massive security operation that shows the other side of cleveland’s big moment. city and u.s. officials are preparing for the worst, aware that tensions over race relations and police use of force, as well as reaction to trump’s polarizing campaign, could result in violence on the streets. clevelanders are also aware of the backdrop for their convention: the mass shooting in orlando that killed 50 people in june, the sniper attack that killed five dallas police this month, and the truck assault that killed 84 this week in nice. on this same idyllic block just over a year ago, police in riot gear clashed with demonstrators reacting to the acquittal of police officer charged with manslaughter for firing 15 rounds into the car of an unarmed black man and woman, killing them both. more than 70 people were arrested, disturbing the al fresco dining experience on east 4th street. unrest also followed the fatal police shooting in 2014 of 12 year old tamir rice, an african american who had a toy gun, and the officer who shot him was not charged with a crime. cleveland, a city of 390,000, has been revitalized in part by billions of dollars in infrastructure spending in recent years, but the black majority still lags behind. black lives matter, the protest group formed after a series of police killings of african americans raised questions about justice in america, held a protest on saturday in public square. it was entirely peaceful, with about 100 activists clapping to speeches. in between the civic protest and festival atmosphere, there are pockets of emptiness. street closing and security cordons seem to have scared off customers at the arcade, a late 1800s shopping mall that has been modernized. the ornate interior, illuminated by a skylight, is full of boutiques like prosperity, which sells handcrafted art glass jewelry. business is slow on a saturday afternoon. “a lot of people are afraid to come downtown,” said cat zurchin, one of the artist/storeowners, from an empty shop.   “some of these stores opened up just for the convention. retail people have been excited, but we also have some anxiety. the secret service is everywhere.” black suvs have invaded the city center as the u.s. secret service has taken charge of security. concrete median barriers and the tall, anti scaling fence circumscribe the city into impenetrable sectors. a column of police ride through the city center on bicycles, a dozen more on horseback. helicopters clatter overhead.  cleveland police are trying to stay restrained, avoiding the militarized presence that has become common thanks to free war surplus equipment from the pentagon. even so, the city’s courts are preparing to process up to 1,000 arrestees per day, ready to stay open 20 hours a day.  hospitals are bracing for the worst. the cleveland clinic, one of the largest hospitals in the country, will have 50 doctors, nurses and other medical personnel at the convention site and its entire staff on standby. if needed the hospital can take over an adjoining hotel and conference center, enabling it to handle 1,000 general trauma cases. the hospital is prepared to operate without reinforcements for 96 hours. “all boots on the ground,” said dr. robert willie, chief of medical operations.     likewise, the secret service says it can handle the spotlight. “we are prepared,” said ronald rowe, the agent in charge of the convention, “and ready to welcome the world to cleveland.” ",0
" the senate intelligence committee, investigating russian meddling in u.s. 2016 election, has asked president donald trump’s political organization to hand over all documents going back the campaign’s launch in june 2015, the washington post reported on friday, citing two people briefed on the request.  the letter from the senate panel seeking all documents, emails and telephone records arrived at trump’s campaign committee last week and was addressed to its treasurer, the post said. this marked the first time the trump campaign organization has been drawn into the bipartisan committee’s investigation into russian interference in the presidential election, it said. dozens of former campaign staffers are expected to be contacted soon to ensure they are aware of the request, the post said, citing the two people. the letter was signed by republican senator richard burr, the committee’s chairman, and senator mark warner, its top democrat, according to the post, which said representatives for burr and warner declined to comment. the senate panel’s investigation is among several in congress into russian interference in the election, and is separate from a probe into the matter being led by a special counsel appointed last week by the justice department, former federal bureau of investigation director robert mueller. trump’s campaign committee, based at trump tower in new york, is now led by michael glassner, a former deputy campaign manager, and john pence, a nephew of vice president mike pence, the post said. glassner did not immediately respond to a request for comment and a white house representative had no immediate comment, the post said. trump’s administration has been dogged by concerns about its ties to russia and questions over whether trump associates may have cooperated with russians as they sought to meddle in last year’s election on trump’s behalf. u.s. intelligence agencies concluded in january that moscow tried to sway the november vote in trump’s favor. russia has denied involvement, and trump has denied any collusion between his campaign and russia. controversy has engulfed trump since he fired fbi director james comey on may 9 as comey oversaw an investigation into possible collusion between his presidential campaign and russia.

" after struggling to find a consistent message and consolidate party support, donald trump is honing his attack on democratic presidential rival hillary clinton and the foundation bearing her family’s name in hopes of making it a rallying cry for fellow republicans. trump began hammering the democrat this week over the clinton foundation, an organization created by her and her husband former president bill clinton that funds aid programs in developing countries.  on monday, trump called for the foundation to be shut down and for a special prosecutor to be named to investigate it. in particular, he accused clinton of having turned the charity into a “pay for play” scheme in which wealthy donors to the organization got favors from the state department while clinton was secretary of state from 2009 2013. the clinton campaign denied that, saying clinton never took any action because of donations to the foundation. after a primary campaign that left the party bitterly divided, trump has struggled to find an attack line that fellow republicans can rally behind. his criticism of the parents of a dead muslim american soldier who spoke at the democratic national convention drew strong rebukes from many in his own party. his attacks on clinton’s health have been dismissed as conspiracy theories.  clinton, who leads in nearly every national and swing state opinion poll ahead of the nov. 8 election, has largely avoided criticism about the foundation, although there was a spate of media investigations last year after she announced she was running for president. her main democratic rival, u.s. senator bernie sanders, did not attack her on that front during the primary campaign. the focus on the foundation is likely to build some confidence among republicans that trump’s campaign is healing internal divisions. last week, trump shook up his campaign’s top leadership, putting steve bannon and kellyanne conway in top jobs. campaign chairman paul manafort resigned. chris collins, a republican member of congress, said supporters have been urging trump to focus on clinton.  “anything we can do to put her character forefront in the campaign is going to help donald trump,” collins said in a phone interview. republican chairman reince preibus said if trump continues  to remain “measured,” he could be “tied or ahead” in the polls by the first week in september. recent reuters/ipsos opinion polls have found clinton increasing her lead over trump during august. the latest poll, on monday, showed clinton at 45 percent, and trump at 33 percent. clinton’s campaign has pushed back at the attack. clinton spokesman robby mook said the foundation will not shut down given its humanitarian work, and he did not see it hurting clinton’s lead in polls. “this is an absurd call by donald trump. it is an act of desperation on his campaign given the turmoil that we’ve seen from his campaign in recent weeks,” he told msnbc. trump abandoned plans to deliver a policy speech on thursday about immigration. the postponement came as signs of internal disagreement on his immigration policy became public, but the move also allowed him to focus on what he and his advisers see as a clinton weakness.  the foundation has long been a potential liability for clinton. the fact it accepted corporate and foreign donations sparked criticism that it represented a conflict of interest while clinton was secretary of state. on sunday, the foundation announced it would no longer accept foreign donations if clinton is elected and that the group is prepared to hand off programs to other charity organizations. democrats are hopeful trump is making an issue of the foundation too late for it to make a difference.  most american voters already have an opinion of hillary clinton, said jim manley, a democratic strategist who once worked for senate minority leader harry reid.  “the views are pretty hardened on both sides, and i don’t think anything is going to move that needle,” he said. both clinton and trump have unusually high “unfavorable” ratings among voters, although trump currently scores worse on that score, opinion polls show.  the dual controversies over the foundation and over clinton’s use of a private server and email account while secretary of state dovetailed on monday. conservative legal group judicial watch sought to make the case that previously unreleased emails provide evidence that clinton offered access to donors to the foundation while she was secretary of state.

" administrators closed kenya s oldest university on tuesday, citing fears for students  safety in a planned protest over police beatings at a campus demonstration last week. kenyan police frequently face accusations of brutality and extrajudicial killings from civilians and rights groups, but officers are rarely charged and almost never convicted.  despite this, kenya, an economic and transport hub in east africa and a key western ally in a volatile region, receives substantial financial support for its security services from international donors, including the united states and britain.   rights groups say at least 28 people were killed, mostly by police, in unrest following the aug. 8 election, whose results were later nullified by the supreme court due to irregularities.  a re run of the presidential vote is scheduled for oct. 26 and the conduct of the police will be closely watched.  on sept. 28, university of nairobi students protested against the arrest of an opposition lawmaker. police responded by entering dormitories and classrooms, dragging out students, beating them with clubs and firing tear gas, according to a reuters witness. the university said 27 students were injured.  a police spokesman did not respond to requests for comment but a presidential spokesman told local radio on monday that robbers were hiding among the students.  on tuesday, students had planned to demonstrate against the beatings but instead administrators shut down the university.   the (university of nairobi) senate has decided to send the students home for their (own) safety,  john orindi, the university s corporate affairs director, told reuters. on tuesday morning, riot policemen stood near a truck with water cannon outside the campus gates.  a 20 year old veterinary student who did not want to be named for fear of retribution said students wanted the vice chancellor to resign  for allowing anti riot police to enter campus and seriously injure students . university officials had talks on monday with the interior minister, police chief and the head of a kenyan government watchdog that is charged with investigating complaints against the police.

" poland s new prime minister said on thursday he expected the european commission to launch an unprecedented punishment procedure against warsaw next week after months of wrangling over the rule of law. several thousand people gathered in poland s largest towns on thursday evening to protest against a judiciary system overhaul, while the upper chamber of parliament discussed the proposed legislation. mateusz morawiecki, who took over as poland s premier this week, has defended the judicial changes pushed over two years by his predecessor from the same law and justice (pis) party, saying they were necessary to heal the courts. western european union peers, the bloc s executive commission, opposition at home and democracy advocates say the reforms undermine court independence by putting them under more direct government control.  under the legislation, parliament would have a virtual free hand in choosing members of the national judiciary council (krs), a body that decides judicial appointments and promotions   a right earlier reserved chiefly for the judges themselves. a second bill envisages lowering the mandatory retirement age for supreme court judges to 65 years from 70, which would force a significant part of them to leave. this, as well as the eurosceptic, nationalist pis s changes to the state media, have prompted the commission to threaten for many months to launch the so called article 7 against warsaw. pis faced renewed accusations that it was muzzling free media after poland s media regulator slapped a $415,000 fine on a leading, u.s. owned news broadcaster tvn24 over its coverage of opposition protests in parliament last year. morawiecki rejected the view that the penalty amounted to an assault on the freedom of media in poland, saying the country of 38 million people enjoyed full media pluralism. he expected tvn to challenge the move in courts which would make the final call.  pis has also locked horns with the eu over large scale logging in the unique bialowieza forest, which warsaw says is necessary to keep the woods healthy but brussels and environmental groups say violate wildlife protection laws. bitter feuds over migration   which morawiecki on thursday called a political  hot potato    have added to the growing isolation of the bloc s largest ex communist country since pis won elections in late 2015. article 7 would see poland s government denounced as undemocratic and could lead to the suspension of warsaw s voting rights in the eu. the latter, however, is unlikely as it would require the unanimous backing of all the other eu states, something pis ally hungary has vowed to block.  but morawiecki, speaking ahead of his first summit of eu leaders in brussels, seemed to accept that the blow was coming.  if a process has started and, as far as i understand, the decision has already been made that next wednesday the european commission plans to start (the procedure), then it will most likely be triggered,  he told reporters.  from the start of such an unfair procedure for us, until it ends, we will certainly talk to our partners.  a senior eu official said the commission s head, jean claude juncker would still seek to dissuade warsaw from going ahead with the two judiciary laws, which were passed by poland s lower chamber of parliament.  they must still go through the pis dominated upper house and be signed by the pis allied president to take effect.   if the court changes go through then we will trigger article 7,  the senior official said.  if the changes are postponed until january, then we will see.  morawiecki stuck to his guns over the courts and poland s refusal to host some of the refugees who reach the bloc. he said poland would respect the final ruling of the bloc s top court on the bialowieza forest. so far, warsaw has continued the logging despite an interim order by the court to stop immediately. morawiecki added he would seek to convince france to soften its stance on a reform of the bloc s labor laws. president emmanuel macron wants them tightened because he sees them as giving too much of a competitive edge to cheaper labor from the poorer eastern europe at the expense of france s own workers.

" the united states sees value in the new start arms control treaty with russia, despite washington’s concerns about moscow’s track record on arms control and other issues, senior u.s. officials said on friday. the remarks by the trump administration officials, speaking to reporters on condition of anonymity, suggest the treaty will remain in force and the door remains open to pursuing an extension of the accord, which is set to expire in 2021. the new strategic arms reduction treaty gives both countries until february 2018 to reduce their deployed strategic nuclear warheads to no more than 1,550, the lowest level in decades. it also limits deployed land  and submarine based missiles and nuclear capable bombers. reuters has reported that president donald trump, in his first call with russian president vladimir putin, criticized the new start treaty, saying it favored moscow. but one of the trump administration officials said on friday the united states was not looking to discard new start. senior u.s. officials, including u.s. defense secretary jim mattis, have questioned russia’s reliability on arms control, citing longstanding u.s. allegations that russia has violated the cold war era intermediate range nuclear forces (inf) treaty. russia denies treaty violations and accuses the united states of them. the accusations come amid a nosedive in u.s. russian relations. u.s. intelligence agencies accuse russia of meddling in the u.s. presidential election, which moscow denies, and recent tit for tat exchanges between washington and moscow include moves to slash each others’ diplomatic presence. the tensions have reached syria, where the united states and russia are backing different forces that are scrambling to claim what is left of islamic state held territory. russia warned the united states on thursday it would target u.s. backed militias in syria if russian troops again came under fire. still, a second senior trump administration official said friday the united states was seeking ways to improve communication with moscow and build some degree of trust, which the official described as non existent. trump took office saying he wanted to improve ties strained since moscow’s 2014 annexation of crimea and the separatist conflict in eastern ukraine, which led washington to impose sanctions on russia. ukraine’s petro poroshenko met trump on thursday and said afterward that they had a shared vision of a “new level” of defense cooperation. but the second senior trump administration official said there had been no decision on whether to provide defensive arms to ukraine, something kiev has long wanted.

" the united states carried out its first air strikes against islamic state militants in somalia and killed  several terrorists,  the u.s. military said on friday.  the pentagon s africa command said the first strike was carried out at midnight local time (2100 gmt, thursday) and another one at 11 a.m. on nov. 3.   several terrorists  were killed, the military said in a statement, adding that the strikes were conducted in coordination with somalia s government.   u.s. forces will continue to use all authorized and appropriate measures to protect americans and to disable terrorist threats,  the statement said. islamic state has been gathering recruits in the region, although experts say the scale of its force is unclear and it remains a small player compared to the al shabaab group. last month, a group loyal to islamic state seized a small port town in somalia s semi autonomous puntland region, the first town it has taken since emerging a year ago. the group, which refers to itself simply as islamic state, is a rival to the larger al shabaab force, which is linked to islamic state s rival al qaeda and once controlled much of somalia. the united states has occasionally carried out strikes against al shabaab militants in somalia, which retains a strong presence in parts of the south and center and carries out gun and bomb attacks. the al shabaab group aims to drive out the peacekeepers, topple somalia s western backed government and impose its strict version of islam on the horn of africa state. more than 350 people were killed in twin bombings in the somali capital mogadishu last month, the deadliest attack in the country s history. earlier this year, the white house granted the u.s. military broader authority to carry out strikes in somalia against al shabaab.

" some somali lawmakers said on wednesday they plan to impeach the president in a mounting political crisis that could put the fledgling government on a violent collision course with one of the country s most powerful clans.  the political turmoil endangers fragile gains against the islamist al shabaab insurgency and could derail the government of president mohamed abdullahi. universally known by his nickname  farmajo , the dual u.s. somali citizen took power earlier this year in a u.n. backed process.  the horn of africa state s parliament adjourned last week until the end of february, but some legislators want it to reconvene on an emergency basis, lawmaker mahad salad told reuters.  ninety six lawmakers have asked the speaker to reopen the session so that the impeachment against the president kicks off. the president is accused of violation of the constitution, treason, destruction of the federal states and so on,  he said.  the letter had not yet been delivered to the speaker. there are 275 lawmakers and two thirds would have to vote against the president to impeach him.  the motion follows a deadly raid on sunday on the home of an opposition leader, abdirahman abdishakur warsame, who ran for the presidency against farmajo. somali security agents arrived at his house around midnight and engaged his guards in a firefight, killing five people. the minister of security said warsame resisted arrest and he would be charged with treason. he appeared in court on tuesday but no warrant was shown for his arrest, a witness said. a wednesday court hearing was postponed until thursday.  the information minister did not return calls seeking comment. a statement from the security minister and attorney general said they were  investigating the crimes of somalis who were involved in treason, terror and the destruction of government systems . warsame comes from somalia s formidable habar gidir clan, which is spread across south central somalia. although both his supporters and the government stress that his detention is political, rather than a clan issue, it will further sour relations between the two sides. if that sparks fighting it could split somalia s security forces, which are composed mostly of clan based militias. in september, a battle between the police, intelligence, and military killed nine people in mogadishu s habar gidir district.   it s a lose lose situation for the government. if they pursue this, they face a showdown with the habar gidir, who are powerful, wealthy and well armed and provide many units in the sna,  said a somalia security analyst who spoke on condition of anonymity, referring to the somali national army.   if they back down, they look weak. it s very hard to see how the administration could survive this crisis.   in august, a joint u.s. somali raid in the town of bariire killed 10 habar gidir members. the u.s. military said they were islamist militants but clan elders said they were civilians. in may, a soldier accidentally killed the minister of public works in a case of mistaken identity. a habar gidir clan member, the soldier was sentenced to death, angering clan members who felt that blood money should have been accepted. somalia s new government has won plaudits from diplomats for trying to assess the extent of mismanagement and corruption in the armed forces and the international monetary fund has praised it for fiscal reforms. but at home, the government has many problems. it has hired and fired a string of top security officials. al shabaab militants, skilled at exploiting clan divisions, stepped up a campaign of deadly bombings in mogadishu. one october bomb killed more than 500 people.  a split between qatar and the united arab emirates, both of which have supported somali factions, has fuelled a spat between the president and leaders of somalia s regional administrations, damaging security cooperation.   this month, the u.s. government announced it was suspending aid to most of the military over accountability concerns. now many parliamentarians are angry that a government that promotes itself as reformist is arresting critics like warsame, said abdirizak mohamed, a lawmaker and former security minister.   mps are concerned about freedom of expression and association. this was an unnecessary crisis when they already had a lot on their plate.

" the u.s. federal government is working on a long term plan to help puerto rico rebuild after hurricane maria tore up the island territory’s power grid and other infrastructure three weeks ago, an administration official said on wednesday. the u.s. house of representatives is set to vote on thursday on a disaster relief bill that includes a $4.9 billion loan for puerto rico and the u.s. virgin islands as part of a $36.5 billion package to help americans recover from hurricanes and wildfires. but the loan is intended to be a short term measure to help the cash strapped island territory pay urgent bills, the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. “the community disaster loan cannot and does not address the recovery, rebuilding and future of puerto rico, which the administration intends to address with a more long term solution in concert with the puerto rican government, oversight board, court and congress,” the official said. the broader package set for the house vote includes $576.6 million for wildfire efforts, $16 billion for the national flood insurance program and a provision enabling low income puerto ricans to receive emergency nutrition assistance. house speaker paul ryan is set to travel to puerto rico on friday with a bipartisan group of lawmakers to see the hurricane damage, a spokesman said. the white house last week asked government agencies to begin estimating how much money is needed to help hurricane hit states and territories recover and rebuild. puerto rico, home to 3.4 million american citizens, is in a particular bind, already grappling with nearly $72 billion in debt before hurricane maria   the worst storm in almost a century   hit its shores. estimates of the cost to its economy range as high as $95 billion. puerto rico’s governor ricardo rossello has asked for $4.6 billion as a “down payment on hurricane recovery efforts,” including $3.2 billion in block grants. the oversight board charged with resolving puerto rico’s debt crisis told the u.s. treasury department that the island’s government would run out of money at the end of the month without help. the loan is earmarked for payroll and pensions, but cannot be used for debt service.

" statements donald trump has made during his presidential run should generally be admissible in an upcoming civil trial over alleged fraud at his trump university venture, lawyers for the plaintiffs said in a court filing late on tuesday. some of the statements by the republican nominee may be helpful to jurors as they try to determine trump’s credibility, the lawyers wrote, calling his credibility a central issue. students at trump university have sued in a federal court in san diego, claiming they were defrauded by its real estate seminars. a trial is set to begin on nov. 28. last month, trump’s attorneys said evidence and statements from the election campaign should be barred from the trial because they could unfairly prejudice the jury. their request would include allegations of sexual misconduct, which trump has denied during the campaign. lawyers for the plaintiffs said trump’s request was far too broad, threatening to exclude a “mélange of misrepresentations, falsehoods and flip flops” that would impeach trump’s credibility as a witness. “in the course of the campaign, news organizations have collected and publicized practically every known trump falsehood over the years, bringing all such statements within the gambit of trump’s motion,” lawyer brian cochran and others wrote.  a lawyer for trump could not immediately be reached for comment on wednesday.

" alabama officials on thursday certified democrat doug jones the winner of the state’s u.s. senate race, after a state judge denied a challenge by republican roy moore, whose campaign was derailed by accusations of sexual misconduct with teenage girls. jones won the vacant seat by about 22,000 votes, or 1.6 percentage points, election officials said. that made him the first democrat in a quarter of a century to win a senate seat in alabama.  the seat was previously held by republican jeff sessions, who was tapped by u.s. president donald trump as attorney general. a state canvassing board composed of alabama secretary of state john merrill, governor kay ivey and attorney general steve marshall certified the election results. seating jones will narrow the republican majority in the senate to 51 of 100 seats. in a statement, jones called his victory “a new chapter” and pledged to work with both parties. moore declined to concede defeat even after trump urged him to do so. he stood by claims of a fraudulent election in a statement released after the certification and said he had no regrets, media outlets reported. an alabama judge denied moore’s request to block certification of the results of the dec. 12 election in a decision shortly before the canvassing board met. moore’s challenge alleged there had been potential voter fraud that denied him a chance of victory. his filing on wednesday in the montgomery circuit court sought to halt the meeting scheduled to ratify jones’ win on thursday. moore could ask for a recount, in addition to possible other court challenges, merrill said in an interview with fox news channel. he would have to complete paperwork “within a timed period” and show he has the money for a challenge, merrill said. “we’ve not been notified yet of their intention to do that,” merrill said. regarding the claim of voter fraud, merrill told cnn that more than 100 cases had been reported. “we’ve adjudicated more than 60 of those. we will continue to do that,” he said.  republican lawmakers in washington had distanced themselves from moore and called for him to drop out of the race after several women accused him of sexual assault or misconduct dating back to when they were teenagers and he was in his early 30s.  moore has denied wrongdoing and reuters has not been able to independently verify the allegations.

" south africa s national prosecuting authority (npa) has given president jacob zuma until nov. 30 to make submissions before it  decides whether to reinstate 783 corruption charges filed against him before he became president, it said on friday. the supreme court of appeal last friday upheld a high court ruling to reinstate the charges against zuma. they were set aside in april 2009 by the then head of the npa, paving the way for zuma to run for president later that year. the ruling by the appeals court amplified calls for zuma, 75, to step down before his term as president ends in 2019. a spokesman for zuma was not immediately available.  zuma has faced a series of corruption allegations, most recently over leaked emails that suggest his friends the influential gupta family may have used their influence to secure state contracts for their companies. zuma and the guptas deny wrongdoing. following last friday s ruling, the npa was required to make a decision on the charges, which relate to a 30 billion rand ($2 billion) government arms deal arranged in the 1990s. zuma requested the npa to give him a chance to make representations before deciding whether to proceed against him. on friday, the npa accepted that request but said any further submissions by zuma should be on issues not previously considered by authorities. the npa also asked anti corruption officials to report on the availability of the witnesses in the case by nov. 30. mmusi maimane, leader of the main opposition party, the democratic alliance, welcomed the npa s action but said in a statement:  we are of the belief that jacob zuma is being afforded special treatment .... any other person would be hauled before a court and charged. it was unclear how long the npa would take to decide on whether to charge zuma after receiving his submissions. it was also unclear what would happen to the charges if the npa decides not to proceed.

" republican state lawmakers in oklahoma have introduced a resolution urging the state’s congressional delegation to start an effort to impeach president barack obama over a white house recommendation that schools accommodate transgender students. the obama administration told u.s. public schools last week that transgender students must be allowed to use the bathroom of their choice. the recommendation upset republicans and raised the likelihood of fights over federal funding and legal authority. the oklahoma resolution, introduced on thursday night, calls on the state’s members of the u.s. house of representatives to file articles of impeachment against obama, the u.s. attorney general, the u.s. secretary of education and others over the policy. a vote has not yet been scheduled on the resolution. legal experts told local media the impeachment call is on shaky ground since the recommendation offered non binding guidance and did not have the force of law. lawmakers in the socially conservative state took up another measure on friday that would allow students to claim a religious right to have separate but equal bathrooms and changing facilities to segregate them from transgender students. that bill, introduced on thursday night and referred to a senate committee on friday, could force schools into costly construction, which would be difficult for them to complete after lawmakers significantly cut education funding to plug a $1.3 billion state budget shortfall.  state representative john bennett, a republican, said in a statement the white house policy was “biblically wrong,” and a violation of state sovereignty. the oklahoma bill would allow for segregation at school restrooms, athletic changing facilities and showers if a request is made to accommodate religious beliefs.   it also allows the attorney general to file lawsuits to implement the changes.  impeachment advocates say obama overstepped his constitutional authority. troy stevenson, executive director of freedom oklahoma, an lgbt advocacy group said the measure promoted fear mongering and was out of place “in a time when our state is facing an unprecedented economic crisis, our lawmakers should be focused on righting the ship rather than stigmatizing transgender youth,” he said in a statement.  the measure was introduced just hours after state lawmakers approved a bill that would make abortions a felony punishable by up to three years in prison for doctors who perform them.  governor mary fallin, an anti abortion republican, vetoed the bill because it would not withstand a criminal constitutional legal challenge, her office said.

" the republican controlled u.s. house of representatives voted on tuesday to protect the identities of wealthy individuals and others who make anonymous, or “dark money,” donations to politically active nonprofit groups. the measure, which drew lobbying support from billionaire industrialists charles and david koch, was approved in a 240 180 vote along party lines. it would prohibit the internal revenue service from collecting the names and addresses of donors who contribute $5,000 or more to 501(c) organizations, a name that refers to the tax code section that covers them. the action sent the bill on to the senate. although the measure would apply to all 501(c) tax exempt groups, such as universities, hospitals and charities, politically active nonprofits are the intended beneficiaries. republicans said the legislation would prevent the internal revenue service from targeting conservative groups following 2013 revelations that tea party organizations were subjected to extra scrutiny. political spending by nonprofit groups including the koch  aligned americans for prosperity has grown dramatically since 2010, when the supreme court opened the way to unlimited spending on political campaigns by individuals, corporations, unions and other groups in its landmark citizens united ruling.  the white house on monday said it opposed the bill, the preventing irs abuse and protecting free speech act, claiming it would constrain the irs from enforcing tax laws and reduce transparency among private foundations. democrats argued that the legislation could make it easier for foreign entities to finance political campaigns inside the united states.  charity regulators have also warned that the loss of donor information would make it harder to protect the public against charity fraud. the change would reduce available information on a range of organizations, irs data shows. republicans said the bill is necessary to protect donors from potential leaks that could subject them to harassment. donor identities are not supposed to be released to the public, hence the term “dark money.”  but leaks have occurred, including the 2012 release of donors to the conservative national organization for marriage that resulted in a settlement requiring the irs to pay the organization $50,000. supporters of the legislation also pointed to signs that the irs may seek to end the disclosure requirement on its own.     nonprofit groups could spend more than $500 million on this year’s presidential and congressional elections, up from $10 million in 2008, according to the nonpartisan center for responsive politics. house republicans are also pushing to censure and impeach irs commissioner john koskinen for allegedly failing to cooperate with a probe of the irs scandal.

" india stood ready to further strengthen ties with the united states, the government said on friday, after u.s. secretary of state tillerson vowed to dramatically expand cooperation as a way to counter china s influence in asia.  tillerson, who is visiting india next week as part of a tour to the region, said in a speech the united states had begun to discuss alternatives to chinese infrastructure financing in asia that critics say has spawned resentment and fears of a debt trap. he also called for expanding the scope of security cooperation between india, the united states and japan to include other countries such as australia, a plan that china has said in the past would be de stabilising to the region. an indian foreign ministry spokesman said tillerson had made an important speech on the future of india u.s. relations and india looked forward to detailed discussions next week.  we appreciate his positive evaluation of the relationship and share his optimism about its future directions,  the spokesman said. tillerson did not say what he meant by creating an alternative to chinese infrastructure financing, which india has also been increasingly concerned about as china seeks to build trade and transport links in asia. india was the only major country in asia not to send a representative to a  belt and road initiative  summit in beijing in may because an economic corridor that china was building in pakistan ran through territory claimed by india.  india warned that china s plans for a modern day  silk road   could create an  unsustainable debt burden  for countries. the ministry spokesman said india agreed with tillerson s call for a  rules based  international order that is seen as under risk from china s assertive posture in asia. the united states has repeatedly criticized china for disregarding international law with the construction and militarization of artificial islands in the disputed south china sea, where neighbors brunei, malaysia, the philippines, taiwan and vietnam have claims.  tillerson has made a significant policy statement on india u.s. relations and its future. he brought out its various strengths and highlighted our shared commitment to a rule based international order,  the indian spokesman said. india, though, has been wary of u.s. calls for a bigger indian military role including joint patrols in the indian ocean and the pacific, worried it would antagonise china further.

" teachers in peru started returning to classrooms on monday after union leaders announced they should suspend a strike that had sparked unrest and dragged on for more than two months in some places. teachers at public schools in peru had sought a sharper salary hike than the government s 12 percent proposal for next year and opposed evaluation based firings. but union leader pedro castillo announced a temporary end to the strike during the weekend after the government threatened to dismiss teachers who did not return to class. the strike threatened to force 3.5 million school children to repeat the academic year and had sunk president pedro pablo kuczynski s approval rating as teachers blocked roads and clashed with police. the education ministry urged parents to work with teachers to set up schedules to make up for lost time. the government offered to introduce its proposed salary increase to a minimum of 2,000 soles ($618) per month in november instead of next year and said teachers 55 and older could retire early. kuczynski s approval rating dropped 13 percentage points to 19 percent in august, according to a monthly opinion poll by gfk   a new low for the former wall street banker in his year old government.

" in a blow to republican presidential candidate donald trump, a u.s. judge on thursday upheld a pennsylvania state law that could make it difficult for his supporters to monitor election day activity in democratic leaning areas. trump has repeatedly said tuesday’s presidential election may be rigged, without providing scant evidence, and has urged supporters to keep an eye out for signs of voting fraud in philadelphia and other heavily democratic areas.  democrats worry that could encourage trump supporters to harass minority voters in a state that could determine whether trump or his democratic opponent, hillary clinton, wins the presidency. voting rights advocates said they are already receiving reports of harassment. democrats have launched a legal blitz of their own in an attempt to shut down trump’s poll watching efforts in pennsylvania and three other battleground states, arguing in lawsuits that republican monitoring efforts amount to “vigilante voter intimidation” that violates federal law. they filed a fourth lawsuit in north carolina on thursday. democrats are also trying to stop the republican national committee from supporting the poll watching efforts of the trump campaign or state parties.  those cases have not yet been resolved. the rnc has said in legal motions that it is not involved in poll watching, which would violate a long standing court order. state parties have argued that they are engaged in legitimate efforts to make sure the election is conducted accurately, while trump’s vice presidential running mate, mike pence, and his campaign manager, kellyanne conway, said they misspoke when they told media outlets that the campaign was working with the rnc on poll watching efforts. in pennsylvania, trump’s poll monitoring plan faces a significant hurdle because state law requires partisan poll watchers to perform their duties in the county in which they are registered to vote.  that could make it difficult to recruit monitors in places like philadelphia, where democrats outnumber republicans by a ratio of eight to one. the city has 120,000 registered republicans and 1,685 voting locations. the pennsylvania republican party sought to suspend that requirement so that poll monitors could come from anywhere in the state, which would enable them to bring in supporters from suburban and rural areas where trump has stronger support. but u.s. district judge gerald pappert said that would be too disruptive to change the law less than a week before tuesday’s vote.  the republican party of pennsylvania did not respond to a request for comment. republican training materials submitted as evidence in several cases show the party is instructing poll monitors not to interact directly with voters, but to contact officials if they see a problem. that appeared to be the message in southern ohio as well, where trump supporter becky covey said the observers she had recruited were told not to interfere with voting activity. “people think they’re going to be a watchdog, but that’s not their job,” covey said. those guidelines could have little influence on trump supporters who decide to engage in anti fraud efforts of their own on election day. the oath keepers, a paramilitary group, plans an undercover effort to monitor voting locations, while trump ally roger stone is mobilizing supporters to conduct an exit poll to double check election results. one right wing group told the news website politico that it has already installed hidden cameras in philadelphia polling stations.  with early voting underway, civil rights advocates said they were already receiving reports of intimidation and harassment.  palm beach county, florida, plans to station law enforcement officers at an early voting site through election day after fielding complaints about bullhorn wielding trump supporters getting too close, according to propublica. democrats in nevada alleged that trump supporters have yelled at voters and tried to block them from entering early voting sites, while civil rights groups in north carolina and texas said they have received reports of intimidating behavior at early voting sites. “we are seeing an uptick in the number of complaints compared to 2012,” said kristen clarke, president of the lawyers’ committee for civil rights under law, a watchdog group.

" u.s. coal company shares dipped alongside renewable energy stocks on wednesday after reports that president donald trump plans to pull the united states from a global accord on fighting climate change. the market reaction reflects concerns, raised by some coal companies in recent months, that a u.s. exit from the paris climate agreement could unleash a global backlash against coal interests outside the united states. peabody energy, the largest publicly traded u.s. coal company dropped 2.2 percent to $24.29 a share, while arch coal fell 0.4 percent to $70.77. a spokesman for peabody said the company would support a decision by trump to withdraw from the paris deal because the “accord is flawed on a number of levels.” cloud peak energy inc had also urged the trump administration to stay in the paris deal to prevent other nations from an aggressive turn against the global coal industry. its shares were down 0.6 percent to $3.39. a spokesman for cloud peak declined to comment. a source briefed on the matter told reuters that trump is planning to follow through on his campaign pledge to pull the united states out of the paris accord, a move designed to help boost domestic energy production and speed economic growth, after weeks of deliberations on the issue.  trump did not confirm the decision, but said he would make an announcement “over the coming days”. a u.s. withdrawal would come over the objections of scores of big u.s. corporations   from wal mart to exxon mobil   worried the move will complicate the business landscape instead of bolstering the economy. “for us, our position on the paris agreement... we need a framework like that to address the risks of climate change,” exxon mobil chief executive officer darren woods told reporters on the sidelines of the company’s annual general meeting on wednesday. exxon had made that case in a recent letter to the white house, he said. exxon dipped 0.7 percent, conocophillips declined 0.2 percent, and chevron corp fell 0.6 percent. crude oil prices fell to a three week low on news that recovering libyan output boosted opec crude output in may. solar energy shares also got hit on wednesday, with first solar inc down 2.5 percent, and sunpower corp each down 3.4 percent.  “regardless of what the president decides on the accord, we expect america’s solar industry to continue to thrive and create jobs, boost the economy and reduce greenhouse gas emissions,” the solar energy industries association said in a statement. shares of tesla inc, which recently acquired solarcity, were up 1.8 percent at $341.01. tesla ceo elon musk said in a twitter post on wednesday that he had done “all i can” to convince trump to stay in the paris accord, and threatened to leave white house advisory councils if trump announces a u.s. exit.  trump campaigned on a promise to unravel obama era climate regulations to help boost domestic oil, gas and coal production. company executives, economists, and analysts have expressed skepticism, however, that his deregulatory agenda can alter existing trends away from coal. u.s. carbon emissions have declined to near 30 year lows, a trend driven by increased natural gas use replacing coal. the vaneck vectors coal exchange traded fund fell 1.2 percent to $12.71, not far from a five month low hit earlier in may. the etf is on track to fall 7.2 percent this month after rising in the first three months of the year as part of the so called trump trade.

" a u.s. appeals court on friday said president donald trump’s hotly contested travel ban targeting people from six muslim majority countries should not be applied to people with strong u.s. ties. the 9th u.s. circuit court of appeals, which covers several west coast states, also said its ruling would be put on hold pending a decision on the latest version of the travel ban from the trump administration by the u.s. supreme court. since taking office in january, trump has been struggling to enact a ban that passes court muster. a three judge panel from the 9th circuit narrowed a previous injunction from a lower federal court to those people “with a credible bona fide relationship with the united states.” it also said that while the u.s. president has broad powers to regulate the entry of immigrants into the united states, those powers are not without limits. “we conclude that the president’s issuance of the proclamation once again exceeds the scope of his delegated authority,” the panel said. the ban targets people from chad, iran, libya, somalia, syria and yemen seeking to enter the united states. trump, a republican, has said the travel ban is needed to protect the united states from terrorism. the state of hawaii, however, challenged it in court, and a honolulu federal judge said it exceeded trump’s powers under immigration law. trump’s ban also covers people from north korea and certain government officials from venezuela, but the lower courts had already allowed those provisions to go into effect. the same three judge 9th circuit panel, which limited a previous version of trump’s ban, heard arguments earlier this month. trump issued his first travel ban targeting several muslim majority countries in january, which caused chaos at airports and mass protests. he issued a revised one in march after the first was blocked by federal courts. that expired in september after a court fight and was replaced with the current version. the ban has some exceptions. certain people from each targeted country can still apply for a visa for tourism, business or education purposes, and applicants can ask for an individual waiver. “we are pleased that the supreme court has already allowed the government to implement the proclamation and keep all americans safe while this matter is litigated. we continue to believe that the order should be allowed to take effect in its entirety,” u.s. justice department spokeswoman lauren ehrsam said in a statement.

" lockheed martin corp (lmt.n) did not turn to corey lewandowski, donald trump’s former campaign manager, and his lobbying firm to steer through the cost dispute around the f 35 fighter plane, a company spokesman said. bloomberg reported on thursday that lockheed, the world’s largest defense contractor, sought lewandowski’s help after an initial discussion on the issue between trump and lockheed’s marillyn hewson didn’t go well. “lockheed has not retained lewandowski, or his lobbying firm,” spokesman william phelps told reuters. the problem erupted in december when trump slammed the f 35 program for being too expensive and said he intends to keep pushing to cut the costs of military hardware. trump also targeted boeing with tweets for “out of control” costs on new air force one planes and sought cancellation of the order. last month, u.s. defense secretary james mattis ordered cost cutting reviews of the f 35 fighter jet and boeing’s (ba.n) next generation of the air force one presidential plane. in june, trump fired lewandowski, who had been overseeing the campaign’s fundraising arm, over a dispute with other advisers. lewandowski helped trump win republican presidential nominating contests.

" brazil s finance minister henrique meirelles has hired social media experts to boost his image ahead of the 2018 election, three sources told reuters on wednesday, the strongest sign yet that the former banker is seriously eyeing a run for president. meirelles hired analysts linked to the get lio vargas foundation (fgv) think tank to study his social media presence on a daily basis and build a communication plan, said one of the sources. the sources requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly about the matter.  they have been working for meirelles for more than three months, two of the sources said. the finance ministry s press office declined comment on meirelles behalf.  the finance minister s potential candidacy adds to political uncertainty ahead of a presidential election marked by a strong anti establishment climate and a lack of clear favorites.  meirelles, praised by investors for leading a market friendly agenda of economic reforms, would have to leave his post by april, six months before the election, and could face a wide field of competitive candidates in a first round vote. one of the analysts hired by meirelles works alongside the ministry s official communication team in brasilia, although the fgv team has not received any public funds for supporting his potential candidacy, two of the sources said.  the team includes thomas traumann, a former spokesman for impeached president dilma rousseff, according one of the sources and another person familiar with the matter. traumann confirmed to reuters that he had consulted for meirelles under private contract since 2015, but he did not work for the finance ministry. he declined to comment on potential preparations for next year s presidential race. the finance ministry said fgv has offered consultancy on social media to the ministry as part of a 40 year long initiative of institutional support, without any connection to the 2018 campaign. a  ministry spokeswoman, who asked not to be named in accordance with ministry policy, said it had no relationship with traumann. fgv said it had not signed a contract with the finance ministry or meirelles. reuters reported late in august, citing a source close to meirelles, that meirelles wanted to run for president but knew he would have a strong chance only if the economy improved substantially after two years of recession.  congressmen from his social democratic party (psd) last month heard from meirelles that he felt honored to have his name floated as a potential candidate. other potential candidates from within president michel temer s fragmented coalition include the governor of sao paulo state, geraldo alckmin, and sao paulo mayor joao doria. meirelles opened a twitter account in june to publicize his actions as minister and has recently left the door open for a potential candidacy, saying he would take a decision on the race by april. about 2 percent of voters have declared their intention to vote for him, according to a recent datafolha poll.  a civil engineer by training, meirelles is the former president of bankboston, which was eventually acquired by bank of america corp, and a former president of brazil s central bank.

" french president emmanuel macron cast himself as the antithesis of donald trump at the united nations on tuesday, a position that could enable him to play the honest broker in international conflicts.  a few hours after the u.s. president pugnaciously defended his unilateralist america first doctrine and launched scathing verbal attacks on north korea and iran, macron took to the same stage to advance a diametrically opposed stance.   multilateralism is the most efficient way to face global challenges. it is the realization of a vision of the world that protects us,  macron said in his first address to the u.n. annual gathering of world leaders in new york.  the response to trump was barely veiled when he added minutes later that multilateralism was  also believing that the united nations has all its legitimacy to act and maintain international balances.  the two men, who had a warm exchange on monday ahead of a bilateral meeting, appear to have little in common on paper, but since his election in may, macron, 39, has nurtured a close relationship with the 71 year old businessman turned politician who entered the white house eight months ago. despite trump s unpredictable foreign policy, macron has sought not to isolate washington, sensing an opportunity to sway its thinking and elevate the role of france, a nuclear power and permanent member of the u.n. security council, in global affairs. as part of that, macron has also sought to improve ties with russia despite its tense relationship with the west.  iran us mediation  while trump on tuesday called a 2015 nuclear deal with iran an  embarrassment  and the  worst ever , macron staunchly defended it as  good  and labeled its opponents as  irresponsible.   that president trump thinks that this agreement is not perfect and doesn t protect enough is an argument that i can hear, but i asked him what was his alternative proposal. i didn t understand it,  macron later told reporters. he quickly followed the criticism with an acknowledgment that trump s fears were not completely irrational.   i m proposing additional elements (to the deal) that are independent, but that will alleviate concerns that the united states and countries in the region may have,  macron said. french and european diplomats said macron had also had a frank exchange with iran s president hassan rouhani on monday, warning him that tehran should stop destabilizing the region and stoking trump s furor.   jaw jaw better than war war despite little prospect of getting iran and the united states around the same table to push a new peace initiative to end a six year old syria civil war, macron suggested he would try to mediate between the two rivals.  if we don t resolve the syrian problem with iran around the table, then we will not have an efficient response because iran today is among the powers that have an influence on the ground,  macron said. paris is trying to set up an international contact group on syria to revive stalled peace talks in geneva, but trump s anti iran stance has partly complicated those efforts.  noting the u.s. refusal today, i want that the contact group advances and that the united nations and france can serve as intermediaries with iran,  macron said.  macron, france s youngest leader since napoleon two centuries ago, used the u.n. platform to stress that war was truly a last resort and that past mistakes had shown that. trump had earlier escalated his standoff with north korea over its nuclear challenge, threatening to  totally destroy  the country of 26 million people and mocking its leader, kim jong un, as a  rocket man.   multilateralism must do everything to avoid war. every time we have forgotten this and tried to get a short term satisfactory solution without a diplomatic roadmap we failed and that was the case in iraq and libya,  macron said.   with north korea we are not there. i think it is untimely to put forward the threat of war,  he added, urging better implementation of sanctions to pressure pyongyang back to peace talks. despite clear differences on policy, macron has repeatedly emphasized that he shares certain objectives with trump, making crushing islamic state and countering global terrorism leading priorities.  we have an exemplary relationship with the united states in fighting terrorism in africa and the middle east,  macron said.  while trump irked macron with his decision to pull out of a landmark international accord reached in paris in 2015 to fight climate change, the french leader has not given up on trying to get trump to reconsider.   we have a disagreement on climate. president trump said he wanted to leave the deal, but on a legal basis he still needs to put that into action so it s not a legal reality yet.  the paris accord is a basis.. i will make it live. i continue to talk to the united states with the hope that it comes back into the international fold and clarifies its vision of things.

" u.s. senator ben cardin, the top democrat on the senate foreign relations committee, said on wednesday he does not expect an upcoming vote on a $700 million sale of f 16 fighter jets to pakistan to keep the deal from going ahead. however, he said there was still discussion of whether u.s. taxpayer funds could be used to finance the purchase. president barack obama’s administration announced on feb. 12 that it had approved the sale of the lockheed martin corp (lmt.n) aircraft as well as radars and other equipment to pakistan. it drew immediate criticism from india and concern from some members of congress.  republican senator rand paul in late february invoked legislation known as the arms export control act in the hope of stopping the sale by passing a resolution of disapproval, calling pakistan “an uncertain ally.” cardin told reporters he opposed paul’s resolution and expected it would fail, with the chamber’s republican and democratic leaders opposing it. the measure could be taken up by the senate as soon as thursday. cardin said lawmakers had concerns about pakistan’s nuclear program, commitment to fighting terrorist organizations and cooperation in the afghanistan peace process but generally supported the sale. “it was not controversial that pakistan needs to modernize its air force and its counter insurgency and counter terrorism activities, particularly in the mountainous territory of the border with afghanistan,” he said. congress is currently considering a request to “reprogram” some funds, in other words, use them for a different purpose than allocated in a budget bill, to help finance the deal. cardin said he was not yet prepared to make a judgment on whether u.s. taxpayer funds should be used to help pakistan with the purchase.

" rolling back territorial gains by the taliban and strengthening the afghanistan army’s ability to fight will be two key objectives of president donald trump’s new strategy for the country, a senior administration official said on tuesday. trump, in a televised speech on monday, promised a stepped up military campaign against taliban insurgents who have gained ground against the u.s. backed afghan government. in outlining his strategy to give the u.s. military more authority to make battlefield decisions, trump did not provide a timetable for determining whether the mission is a success or how commanders would be able to judge progress. the senior administration official said, however, that one general measure of progress was assessing how much and what territory is controlled by the afghan government or by the taliban and other extremist groups such as islamic state’s afghan affiliate. “it’s also the estimated number of fighters, the presence of al qaeda and isis, how strong are they, how many fighters do they have, how are their training camps, what are their finance networks like,” the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. also key will be the effectiveness of the afghan army and whether u.s. led armed forces can help it seize control of some territory held by the taliban, the official added.  trump, who was reluctant to approve a deeper engagement in afghanistan after 16 years of war, wanted to keep a close eye on whether progress is being made, the official said. “i think we’re going to be taking the temperature continuously,” the official said. “i don’t think we expect to see any real gains materialize for at least six months. but from that point on, it’s going to be something that we essentially never stop evaluating.” u.s. backed afghan forces overthrew the taliban’s hard line islamist government in late 2001 because it sheltered al qaeda chief osama bin laden, architect of the sept. 11 attacks on new york and washington that year.  u.s. forces have been bogged down since in a war that has vexed three american presidents. about 2,400 u.s. troops have died there in america’s longest military conflict.    three u.s. officials said on tuesday the administration had yet to settle on specific metrics to measure progress in afghanistan and assess the contributions of the afghan government, pakistan, india and america’s nato allies. one of the officials said there was no point “in setting specific targets, much less making them public, because that would risk making our partners think that once they had met those marks, they didn’t have to do more.” “what we’re after is a progressive process,” the official said, “so for example the afghan security forces keep improving their capabilities until they don’t need us anymore, the government in kabul keeps improving its record on eliminating corruption and improving local, regional and national governance.” but representative adam schiff, the top democrat on the house intelligence committee, struck a critical tone on tuesday. “while a ‘conditions based’ approach is appealing to military leaders because it gives the taliban less certainty about how long it will take to wait us out, it also diminishes pressure on the afghan government to reform itself and give the afghan people something worth fighting for, since it indicates a willingness to bail them out indefinitely,” schiff said in a statement.

" nigeria is replacing the military commander of the fight against boko haram after half a year, an army spokesman said on wednesday, following a string of insurgency attacks despite years of official claims the group has almost been defeated.  the shake up underscores the fragility of the security situation in nigeria s northeast, where the conflict with the  islamist insurgent group is now in its ninth year, despite assertions by president muhammadu buhari s administration that it is on its last legs. a military spokesman confirmed the replacement of ibrahim attahiru, theater commander of the operation against boko haram, in a text message to reuters. major general rogers nicholas will take his position. the spokesman did not provide further details.  attahiru s removal comes in the wake of a series of  embarrassing  attacks, two military sources told reuters. they said the conduct of the war against the insurgents is now being reviewed. the attacks, which occurred during attahiru s command, include the kidnapping of members of an oil prospecting team which led to at least 37 people being killed in july, and  deadly assaults on the towns of magumeri, biu and madagali, the sources said. a spokesman for the president, who serves as nigeria s commander in chief, declined to comment. the governor of borno state, which is at the epicenter of the insurgency, has said the government s long term plan now is to corral civilians inside fortified garrison towns    effectively ceding the countryside to boko haram. that plan and the spate of deadly attacks have raised questions about assertions by the government and military that boko haram has been all but wiped out, as well as doubts about nigeria s ability to retain sovereign integrity in the northeast.

" china signaled on wednesday it was willing to back an international inquiry into atrocities in yemen, as demanded by the u.n. high commissioner for human rights, but saudi arabia and the united states said they did not support the idea. for three years running u.n. human rights chief zeid ra ad al hussein has asked the 47 countries in the u.n. human rights council to set up an independent investigation into yemen s war, which has killed at least 10,000, destroyed the economy, led to a cholera epidemic and pushed millions to the brink of famine.  despite his pleas, they have twice supported a saudi plan to let yemen investigate by itself.    on wednesday, the netherlands and canada unveiled a draft resolution to establish an international commission of inquiry (coi) to ensure that  perpetrators of violations and abuses, including those that may constitute war crimes and crimes against humanity, are held accountable . the three page text was supported by many countries when diplomats met to discuss amendments.  we agree with the actions, including the coi, to promote the political solving of the yemen crisis,  a chinese delegate told the meeting, which was boycotted by the arab group of countries supporting a rival saudi led resolution. britain and the united states said they wanted to see consensus around a single resolution.      we do have concerns that a full international independent commission of inquiry is not likely to get us there,  u.s. diplomat michele roulbet told the meeting. saudi arabia, which leads an international coalition battling the iran aligned houthi movement in yemen, said the time was not right for an international inquiry. although zeid has said yemen is not up to the job of investigating its own war, saudi ambassador abdulaziz alwasil said yemen s national commission was in a better position to investigate for the time being.  we have no objection to the inquiry itself, we just have a discussion about the timing, whether this is the right time to establish an international commission, with the difficulties on the ground,  alwasil told reporters. georgette gagnon, head of field operations at the u.n. human rights office, said yemen s own human rights commission was  established by, is funded by and reports to a party to the conflict  and said it was way past time for an effective probe.   not having an international inquiry would be a green light to the parties to the conflict,  said radhya al mutwakel, co director of yemen s mwatana organization for human rights. zeid said on monday there had been only  minimal  efforts at holding people to account in what the united nations has branded the world s worst humanitarian crisis. the saudi envoy said the international community should focus its efforts on gaining access for humanitarian personnel. the saudi led coalition has also has set up a team to investigate civilian casualties. on tuesday it said it had found a series of deadly air strikes had been largely justified.

" u.s. government experts think north korea could conduct a new missile test within days, in what would be its first launch since it fired a missile over japan in mid september, two  authoritative u.s. government sources said on tuesday. one of the sources, who did not want to be identified, said the united states had evidence that japanese reports about the monitoring of signals suggesting north korea was preparing a new missile test were accurate.  both sources said u.s. government experts believed a new test could occur  within days.  a japanese government source said earlier on tuesday that japan had detected radio signals suggesting north korea may be preparing another ballistic missile launch, although such signals were not unusual and satellite images did not show fresh activity. south korea s yonhap news agency, citing a south korean government source, also reported that intelligence officials of the united states, south korea and japan had recently detected signs of a possible missile launch and have been on higher alert. the u.s. officials who spoke to reuters declined to say what type of missile they think north korea might test, but noted that pyongyang had been working to develop nuclear tipped missiles capable of hitting the united states and had already tested inter continental ballistic missiles. other u.s. intelligence officials have noted that north korea has previously sent deliberately misleading signs of preparations for missile and nuclear tests. these have been in part to mask real preparations, and in part to test u.s. and allied intelligence on its activities. after firing missiles at a rate of about two or three a month since april, north korea paused its missile launches in late september, after it fired a missile that passed over japan s northern hokkaido island on sept. 15. last week, north korea denounced u.s. president donald trump s decision to relist it as a state sponsor of terrorism, calling it a  serious provocation and violent infringement.  the designation allows the united states to impose more sanctions, though some experts said it risked inflaming tensions. trump has traded insults and threats with north korean leader kim jong un and warned in his maiden speech to the united nations in september that the united states would have no choice but to  totally destroy  north korea if forced to defend itself or its allies. washington has said repeatedly that all options are on the table in dealing with north korea, including military ones, but that it prefers a peaceful solution by pyongyang agreeing to give up its nuclear and missile programs. to this end, trump has pursued a policy of encouraging countries around the world, including north korea s main ally and neighbor, china, to step up sanctions on pyongyang to persuade it to give up its weapons programs.  north korea has given no indication it is willing to re enter dialogue on those terms. south korean unification minister chow myoung gyon told reporters on tuesday there had been  noteworthy  movements from the north since its last missile launch, including engine tests, but there was no hard evidence of another nuclear or missile test.  north korea hasn t been engaging in new nuclear or missile tests but recently we ve seen them persistently testing engines and carrying out fuel tests,  he said.  but we need some more time to see whether these are directly related to missile and nuclear tests.  cho said north korea may announce the completion of its nuclear program within a year, as it is moving more quickly than expected in developing its arsenal. north korea defends its weapons programs as a necessary defense against u.s. plans to invade. the united states, which has 28,500 troops in south korea as a legacy of the 1950 53 korean war, denies any such intention.

" the u.s. government on friday proposed raising payments by 1.35 percent on average next year to the health insurers who offer medicare advantage health benefits to elderly and disabled americans. payments to insurers will vary under the 2017 medicare advantage proposal, based on the region the plans are sold and on the size of bonus payments insurers can receive based on quality ratings, the government said. shares of health insurers rose in after hours trade. analysts said the proposal looked positive for insurers at first glance, but cautioned that they needed to parse it fully. “looks like the best case scenario has played itself out,”  said ipsita smolinski of capitol street, a washington d.c. research firm, who had anticipated about 1 percent increase in payments. insurers and lawmakers have pressured the government not to cut payments, saying any decrease would hurt older americans by forcing insurers to cut benefits.  insurer lobbyist america’s health insurance plans president marilyn tavenner said it was important that the final policy ensure the long term stability of medicare advantage. she said in a statement that the group was looking closely at the proposal. about 17 million americans have healthcare coverage through medicare advantage, offered by insurers including unitedhealth group inc, aetna inc, and anthem inc among others. another more than 30 million people receive benefits through the government medicare fee for service program. shares of anthem inc rose 1.4 percent in after hours trading, while unitedhealth group gained 1.6 percent.  some insurers may benefit more than others from the proposal to pay more to insurers who are managing plans for people who qualify for both medicare and medicaid for the poor, said kim monk, managing director of capital alpha partners. the 1.35 percent increase is based mostly on anticipated medical cost increases next year. the government expects a 3 percent payment growth rate, which is in line with estimates the government provided to insurers in december.  that 3 percent increase is then reduced to 1.35 percent due to lower payments to insurers for sicker than average customers and some medical coding changes, the u.s. department of health and human services medicare agency said on friday.  the 1.35 percent also takes into account an increase in how it pays insurers based on quality measures, called star ratings, it said. the final rate for 2017 medicare advantage payments is based on this proposed figure and will be released in april.

" indonesian authorities detained 22 people late on monday after a violent mob clashed with police at an anti communist protest in the capital jakarta. president joko widodo s government has tried to redress a bloody 1965 anti communist purge, one of the darkest periods in the country s history, but tensions remain over the purge in which an estimated 500,000 people were killed.  the public cannot take the law into their own hands, they must defer to law enforcement apparatus,  widodo said in a statement issued after the clashes. communism is banned in indonesia and any sympathizers are regarded with a deep suspicion and hostility, especially by nationalists and islamists.      five police were injured in the clashes when a mob of around 200 gathered outside the legal aid foundation in central jakarta, which had held a seminar on the 1965 killings at the weekend. protesters threw rocks and water bottles and police fired water cannon and tear gas to disperse the crowd, according to media. activists called for authorities to safeguard such events and for the public to  look critically at history .  repressive attitudes and allowing anarchists to threaten people s rights will cripple our democracy,  the national commission for women s rights said in a statement.   there are victims of 1965 and the stigma associated with (communism) that deserve truth, justice, and healing.  the anti communist purge started in late 1965 after then general suharto and the military took power following an abortive communist coup. a million or more people were jailed, suspected of being communists. successive governments have refused to accept the estimated death toll figure and have refrained from apologizing.     the military, which is accused by activists of gross human rights violations during the 1965 purge, has bristled at any reconciliation efforts.  military chief gatot nurmantyo this year ordered a suharto era propaganda film to be screened for soldiers across the country to mark the anniversary of the abortive coup on sept 30, 1965, the night before the violence was unleashed.

" former manhattan u.s. attorney preet bharara, who earned a reputation for fighting crime on wall street and public corruption before president donald trump fired him in march, has signed a book deal with alfred a. knopf.  the book, as yet untitled, is about “the search for justice, not just in criminal cases but in life and society in general,” knopf said in a statement on thursday. publication is expected in january 2019. bharara said his book would be about the law, “integrity, leadership, decision making, and moral reasoning.” “it addresses what it means to do the right thing, how to avoid doing the wrong thing, and the role of thoughtfulness in making the best choice,” bharara said in a statement. in 2009, president barack obama appointed bharara to serve as u.s. attorney for the southern district of new york, which includes manhattan.  during seven and a half years as the chief federal prosecutor in that region, bharara oversaw several notable corruption and white collar criminal cases, as well as prosecutions of terrorism suspects. “preet bharara’s life experience, coupled with his standing as a u.s. attorney and the cases he tried as prosecutor, makes him uniquely qualified to write this book,” said sonny mehta, editor in chief for knopf, which is a division of penguin random house. bharara, now a distinguished scholar in residence at new york university’s law school, was unexpectedly fired by trump on march 11 after refusing to step down. he had been among 46 u.s. attorneys who were told a day earlier to submit their resignations. in november, bharara met with trump at trump tower in new york city, three weeks after the presidential election, and said at the time that they had a “good meeting” and he agreed to remain in his post as a federal prosecutor.” he was fired a few months later. this month, bharara told abc news in an interview that he received “unusual” phone calls from trump after the election that made him uncomfortable. he said he was fired after declining to take the third call.  bharara said he believed trump’s calls to him violated the usual boundaries between the executive branch and independent criminal investigators. knopf spokesman paul bogaards said on thursday that bharara “addresses the circumstances of his firing in the book proposal.” whether the book itself goes into the details of bharara’s firing “remains an open question,” bogaards said.

" democrat bernie sanders is expected to endorse presidential rival hillary clinton on tuesday at a campaign event in new hampshire, the new york times reported on thursday. citing three democrats who have been involved in the planning, the times said the endorsement was partly the result of daily talks between the candidates’ campaign managers about bringing them together and advancing sanders’ policy priorities. the sanders campaign declined to comment. sanders, a u.s. senator from vermont, has resisted endorsing clinton in a show of party unity since she clinched the democratic nomination last month. sanders chose to continue his campaign as leverage to win concessions on his liberal policy agenda and reforms to the democratic party nominating process. in a speech to supporters last month, sanders vowed to help clinton defeat republican donald trump in the nov. 8 election but did not end his campaign. sanders risked being left behind, however, as other prominent democrats have rallied around clinton, including president barack obama, vice president joe biden and u.s. senator elizabeth warren, a favorite of the party’s liberal wing. clinton, who shifted to the left under pressure from sanders during the campaign, adopted another of his issues on wednesday when she proposed eliminating tuition at public colleges and universities for in state students whose families earn less than $125,000 annually. sanders’ endorsement is expected to ensure he has a prominent speaking slot at the democratic convention later this month, the times quoted the three democrats as saying.

" deportations of undocumented mexican migrants in the united states may start rising when president elect donald trump takes office but the process will not begin soon, mexico’s deputy interior minister for migration said on wednesday. trump surged to victory early on wednesday morning after upsetting pollsters’ predictions to beat democratic rival hillary clinton and seize the white house in a campaign that sent the world into uncertainty. the impact of his win was particularly acute in mexico, where the beleaguered peso currency fell about 10 percent in the aftermath of the vote. trump, who will be inaugurated jan. 20, has vowed to deport millions of undocumented immigrants, fence off mexico with a border wall and threatened to rip up the north american free trade agreement, putting in danger billions of dollars in cross border trade. “it may well be that deportations of the estimated 6 million undocumented mexicans increase but we don’t think it will be a measure that will take place soon or happen quickly,” humberto roque villanueva, the deputy interior minister for migration, told reuters in an interview. “the mexicans over there are useful to the north american economy and president trump, the president elect, will need to recognize the economic effects of such a campaign promise,” he said. roque villanueva also said mexico stands ready to lobby the u.s. congress and use all legal means possible to block trump’s plan for impounding remittances so that mexico ends up paying for his proposed wall on the southern u.s. border. “they wouldn’t be retaliatory measures. they would be legal responses,” he said. “we’ll be ready for all the craziness.” ",0
" the trump administration took an unusual step on friday in its efforts to defang the u.s. financial consumer watchdog created after the banking crisis, with the executive branch of the federal government telling a court that one of its own agencies is violating the u.s. constitution. the justice department filed a brief opposing the consumer financial protection bureau’s appeal of a ruling that its single director structure does not hew to the constitution. the decision that the bureau appealed also said the president should have the power to fire the agency’s head at will. under the 2010 dodd frank wall street reform law that created the cfpb to protect individuals against fraud in lending, the president can only fire the agency director for cause. the cfpb director is currently obama appointee richard cordray, hailed by consumer advocates for taking action against payday lenders, credit card companies and debt collectors. many bankers and wall street executives, along with republican lawmakers, have said his authority to both write and enforce regulations is too wide. the agency can represent itself in court cases except for those before the supreme court, putting president donald trump in a rare predicament: he cannot direct the justice department to withdraw the appeal. instead, the justice department could only file a brief supporting the cfpb’s opponent, mortgage company phh corp. “a single headed independent agency presents a greater risk than a multi member independent commission of taking actions or adopting policies inconsistent with the president’s executive policy,” the justice department argued, saying a commission must compromise, while a single director does not answer to anyone. the department also said that because cfpb directors hold five year terms, a president may not get a chance to appoint someone who agrees with him. cordray’s term expires next year. the department argued the u.s. court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit should allow trump to fire the director at will, upholding the original decision reached by a three member panel of its judges in october.  no u.s. president has ever dismissed an independent agency’s director for cause. republican lawmakers say cordray’s history provides trump with cause for dismissal, although some are seeking a legislative path to fire him. the rare inter agency legal fight was widely expected.  after trump’s election win, some states’ attorneys general and democrats in congress sought permission to represent the cfpb in the appeal, anticipating trump would try to undermine the agency.

" the supreme court on wednesday unanimously upheld the state legislative districts in arizona drawn by an independent commission, rebuffing complaints that the electoral maps diminished the clout of republican voters. the court, in its 8 0 ruling, said the commission that draws legislative boundaries did not violate the u.s. constitution’s principle of “one person, one vote.” the case focused on state legislative districts drawn for the 2012 election based on 2010 census numbers. the challengers said the new districts favored democrats over republicans by packing republican voters into certain districts in a way that would minimize their influence in neighboring districts while enhancing the sway of democratic voters. in mapping out the state legislative districts, arizona’s independent commission carries out a function that in most other states is handled by state legislators.  writing for the court, liberal justice stephen breyer said the deviations in numbers between district populations was not significant enough to be legally troubling, particularly as the state’s redistricting commission was trying to comply with the federal voting rights act, which protects minority voters. the challengers “have not shown that it is more probable than not that illegitimate considerations were the predominant motivation behind the plan’s deviations from mathematically equal district populations,” breyer wrote. a federal court in arizona upheld the districts in a 2014 ruling, saying the commission had made a “good faith attempt” to comply with the voting rights act. the group of republican voters who brought the case then appealed the matter to the u.s. supreme court. the case was the second in as many years concerning arizona’s independent commission. in june 2015, the court rejected another challenge to the commission’s role in drawing congressional districts. in that decision, the court found that the ballot initiative that set up the commission did not violate the u.s. constitution’s requirement that state legislatures set u.s. house of representatives district boundaries. wednesday’s ruling was the second by the court this month touching upon the issue of “one person, one vote.” on april 4, the justices also ruled unanimously in a texas case to uphold the method all 50 states use in drawing legislative districts by counting every resident and not just eligible voters. in that case, the justices rejected a conservative challenge that could have diminished the influence of urban hispanics. the case is harris v. arizona independent redistricting commission, u.s. supreme court, no. 14 232.

" major governments, including the united states, the european union and canada, and top united nations  officials, are among those demanding the release of reuters reporters wa lone and kyaw soe oo from detention in myanmar.  the reporters were arrested on dec. 12 after being invited to meet police officials on the outskirts of yangon. they had worked on stories about a military crackdown in rakhine state, scene of around 650,000 rohingya muslims fleeing to bangladesh since august. myanmar s ministry of information has said the reporters  illegally acquired information with the intention to share it with foreign media,  and released a photo of them in handcuffs. it said the reporters and two policemen faced charges under the british colonial era official secrets act, which carries a maximum prison sentence of 14 years, though officials said they have not been charged. their exact whereabouts are not known.  we and their families continue to be denied access to them or to the most basic information about their well being and whereabouts,  reuters president and editor in chief stephen j. adler said last week in a statement calling for their immediate release.      wa lone and kyaw soe oo are journalists who perform a crucial role in shedding light on news of global interest, and they are innocent of any wrongdoing,  he said. here are comments on their detention from governments, politicians, human rights groups, journalists and press freedom advocates around the world:     the new york times said in an editorial on saturday that releasing the two journalists immediately  would help restore at least some lost faith  in aung san suu kyi s government.   former new zealand prime minister helen clark said it was  disturbing  to hear of the detention of the two reuters journalists.  press freedom is very important,  she said in a tweet on christmas day.   two u.n. human rights experts called on myanmar last week to release the two reporters, saying it was putting myanmar on a dangerous path by using the official secrets act to criminalize journalism.  journalism is not a crime. these detentions are another way for the government to censor information about the military s role in rakhine state and the humanitarian catastrophe taking place,  said yanghee lee and david kaye, who are the u.n. special rapporteur on myanmar and on freedom of expression respectively.   u.s. secretary of state rex tillerson has said the united states was  demanding their immediate release or information as to the circumstances around their disappearance.  last week,  the state department reiterated the u.s. demand for the reporters  immediate release.   senator ben cardin, the leading democrat on the senate foreign relations committee called the arrests  outrageous .  it just brings back the memory of the horrible practices with the repressive military rule,  he said.   republican thom tillis and democrat chris coons, leaders of the u.s. senate human rights caucus, said they were  gravely concerned  about the reporters  arrests and that press freedom was critical to ensuring accountability for violence against the rohingya.    japanese foreign minister taro kano said last week,  freedom of the press is extremely important, including in order to protect fundamental human rights. the japanese government would like to watch (this matter) closely.  tokyo based human rights now has called on japan to take a stronger stance.    the european union has urged myanmar to release the reporters  as quickly as possible.  a spokeswoman for eu  foreign affairs chief federica mogherini said,  freedom of the press and media is the foundation and a cornerstone of any democracy.    u.n. secretary general antonio guterres said countries should do everything possible to secure the journalists  release and press freedom in myanmar.  it is clearly a concern in relation to the erosion of press freedom in the country,  he said.    britain, holland, canada, norway and sweden have demanded the release of the reuters reporters. australia has expressed concern and bangladesh has denounced the arrests.    vijay nambiar, former special adviser on myanmar to the u.n. secretary general, said in a statement to reuters that the detentions had caused  widespread disappointment within and outside the country that is likely to further damage the international reputation and image of myanmar.    president of the european parliament antonio tajani called on myanmar to protect media freedoms and release the reporters.   human rights watch said the detentions appeared to be  aimed at stopping independent reporting of the ethnic cleansing campaign against the rohingya.  brad adams, the group s asia director, said,  their secret, incommunicado detention lays bare government efforts to silence media reporting on critical issues.     the international commission of jurists (icj) called on myanmar to immediately disclose the reporters  whereabouts.  all detainees must be allowed prompt access to a lawyer and to family members,  said frederick rawski, icj s asia pacific regional director.   the committee to protect journalists said the arrests were  having a grave impact on the ability of journalists to cover a story of vital global importance .   reporters without borders said there was no justification for the arrests and the charges being considered against the journalists were  completely spurious .   advocacy group fortify rights demanded myanmar  immediately and unconditionally release the reuters journalists.    myanmar s irrawaddy online news site called on dec. 14 for the journalists  release in an editorial headlined  the crackdown on the media must stop.  it said  it is an outrage to see the ministry of information release a police record photo of reporters handcuffed   as police normally do to criminals   on its website soon after the detention. it is chilling to see that moi has suddenly brought us back to the olden days of a repressive regime.    the southeast asian press alliance said the journalists were  only doing their jobs in trying to fill the void of information on the rohingya conflict.     the protection committee for myanmar journalists, local reporters who have demonstrated against prosecutions of journalists, decried the  unfair arrests that affect media freedom .    the foreign correspondents  club of myanmar said it was  appalled  by the arrests and  gravely concerned  about press freedom in myanmar.    the foreign correspondents  club in thailand, foreign correspondents  association of the philippines, jakarta foreign correspondents  club and foreign correspondents  club of hong kong have issued statements supporting the journalists.

" as congress faces a possible fight over the future of the iran nuclear agreement, senior senate democrats demanded on wednesday that the trump administration provide lawmakers with any information showing tehran is not complying with the international pact. in a letter to secretary of state rex tillerson, defense secretary jim mattis and other cabinet officials first reported by reuters, the lawmakers said the administration had not provided any such information, as is required under the 2015 iran nuclear review act. republican president donald trump has long criticized the nuclear agreement, one of the signature foreign policy achievements of his democratic predecessor, barack obama. in a speech at the united nations on tuesday, trump blasted the deal reached by the united states, five other world powers and iran, known as the jcpoa. he called it an  embarrassment to the united states.  trump is facing a mid october deadline for certifying whether iran is still complying with the jcpoa, in which iran agreed to curb its nuclear program in exchange for sanctions relief. on wednesday, a senior u.s. official said trump was leaning toward not certifying that iran is complying with the pact, and letting congress effectively decide whether to kill the agreement. the 2015 iran nuclear review act gives congress the right to vote on whether to reimpose sanctions suspended under the jcpoa, once the president decides to decertify. the law also requires, however, that the president formally notify congress of any evidence he has to justify that decision. while wednesday s letter was signed only by democrats, even some of trump s fellow republicans have questioned the wisdom of breaking from the agreement, unless trump can provide concrete evidence that iran is not complying with it. congressional aides from both parties also said leaving the agreement seemed unnecessary, especially when washington needs to work with international partners on complicated issues like north korea s nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles program and the civil war in syria and refugee crisis. ed royce, the republican chairman of the house of representatives foreign affairs committee, said on cnn after trump s u.n. speech that the united states should stay in the iran deal, but  enforce the hell out of it.   the democrats  letter on wednesday noted that the 2015 review act required the president to provide information to congress on any iranian breach of the agreement or compliance concern within 10 days of receiving the information.  to date, the senate has received no such notification and the administration has provided little public testimony to congress on the status of iranian compliance with the agreement,  the letter said. the letter asked the administration to provide a written report and, where appropriate, public testimony to senate committees, before oct. 6, if it is aware of any information suggesting iran is not complying or that would lead trump to conclude that the continued suspension of sanctions is not in the u.s. national security interest. the letter to tillerson, mattis, treasury secretary steve mnuchin, energy secretary rick perry and director of national intelligence dan coats was signed by senators sherrod brown, maria cantwell, ben cardin, richard durbin, patrick leahy, jack reed and mark warner.

" the trump administration’s proposal to slash tax rates on so called pass through businesses would deliver a windfall to investors in master limited partnerships and could offer a much needed lift to this niche segment of the energy market. the tax plan outline released on wednesday by u.s. president donald trump would sharply slash business taxes and discount the rate on overseas corporate profits brought back into the united states. the proposed changes include a cut to the top tax rate on pass through businesses to 15 percent from the current rate of up to 36.9 percent. pass throughs get that name because taxes are not paid by the business itself but pass through to their owners’ individual taxes, at that rate. the change would largely benefit owners of private businesses, but u.s. stock market investors holding shares of master limited partnerships, or mlps, would receive the same treatment. mlps build the pipelines and storage tanks and are a common corporate structure in the oil and gas infrastructure sector.  “if the average rate (for mlp investors) is in the 30s, reducing it to 15 percent would be tremendously attractive,” robert willens, president of tax and accounting advisory firm robert willens llc, said on wednesday.  he said if the cuts come through they would make mlps “the most attractive investment from a tax point of view.” mike bresson, a tax partner with the law firm baker botts in houston said trump’s proposed change would enhance an already superior tax structure enjoyed by mlps. “they’re talking about giving mlps the same 15 percent tax rate that corporations get, so that would actually expand the benefits of mlps over corporations,” bresson said.  “the devil is in the details and we haven’t seen them.” mlps have broadly underperformed the wider stock market over the past several years, largely due to the weakness in oil prices. the energy sector was pummeled as crude prices tumbled from above $100 per barrel in mid 2014 to below $30 early last year. they only recently stabilized at around $50 for u.s. oil. “there has been a gradual improvement in mlps now that energy prices have stabilized. it’s still a decent place to invest even without the tax cut,” said bryant evans, portfolio manager at cozad asset management in champaign, illinois. “there should be an almost immediate bounce (in price) once the proposal is solid. it should create more demand for mlp stock in general. but beyond an immediate bounce, it all goes back to how their businesses are doing.” even with their above average dividend yields, mlps have lagged the s&p 500’s total return in the last year by around 240 basis points.  mlp stocks   more specifically, units   are up as a group so far this year, with the alerian mlp etf up 1 percent, though they have fallen 2.1 percent since trump took office   even as his administration has been more friendly to sector projects like the keystone xl pipeline and the dakota access pipeline. the etf rose 0.8 percent tuesday as details of the tax proposal were reported first by the wall street journal. it was the largest gain for the fund in six weeks. among the best performers in the sector this year are shell midstream partners and tallgrass energy partners, both up by more than 11 percent in 2017, while plains all american pipeline and genesis energy are down 5 percent and 9 percent year to date, respectively.

" the republican chairman of the u.s. senate foreign relations committee said on monday that if the house of representatives does not pass a russian sanctions bill, it is because members do not want to impose new sanctions, not because of a procedural issue cited by republican leaders in the house.  “there is no issue, except do they want to pass a russia sanctions bill or not,” senator bob corker told reporters at the u.s. senate. the senate passed the sanctions measure by 98 2 on june 15, but it has been stalled in the house, where president donald trump’s fellow republicans hold a larger majority than in the senate. house republican leaders insisted the delay was purely because the bill violated a constitutional requirement that legislation affecting government revenues must originate in the house, not the senate. they also blamed democrats for holding it up. democrats, and some republicans, scoffed. they said the bill could have been fixed and passed in the house in a matter of minutes. trump administration officials said they disagree with provisions in the bill requiring the president to get congress’ permission before easing any sanctions, and the fact that many of the new sanctions are mandatory, so that the president cannot opt to waive them for national security reasons. some republicans have also echoed concerns raised by u.s. energy firms and european governments that the legislation could complicate investment in russian energy projects, and potentially cost industry jobs. corker said the bill was written to allow the trump administration to address energy related issues. and he said any white house would prefer to conduct foreign policy without congress, but the administration had not asked him to kill the bill. “no one has called me and said, ‘we don’t want this legislation to pass.’ that has never occurred,” corker said. lawmakers and aides said administration officials had held meetings in congress in the past few weeks to express their concerns about the measure. the senate passed the bill a second time by unanimous consent on june 29, with a “fix” to address the procedural issue, but it has still not been taken up by the house. house republicans said on monday that the senate change had not satisfied the procedural concern and that the senate would have to change it and vote again.

" it’s not unusual for a newly minted white house to present what’s known as a “skinny budget,” a wish list of spending requests for congress and some basic economic projections. however, president donald trump’s first crack at the budget, released on thursday, took “skinny” to a new, anemic level as he laid out his plans for boosting military spending, and cutting foreign aid and an array of domestic programs. spreadsheets are out. bullet points are in. weighing in at a mere 53 pages, and containing just four slender tables, trump’s budget had little meat on its bones for experts hungry to dive into the details of the new administration’s fiscal policy. that may make it the skinniest skinny budget, by far, compared with the 40 years of presidential budgets in transition years tracked by the congressional research service (crs). when president jimmy carter took office, his first budget document was 101 pages, the crs said. president george h.w. bush’s first take was 193 pages, and president george w. bush’s was around the same length, at 207 pages. president bill clinton’s first budget document was 145 pages, while president barack obama’s initial take was a leaner 134 pages. the difference is in focus. trump’s budget looks only at “discretionary” programs for the year ahead, accounting for only about a third of the overall budget. it makes no assumptions about “mandatory” spending on programs like social security or medicare, says nothing about spending beyond fiscal 2018, and gives no projections about how promised tax cuts and infrastructure spending might affect the nation’s bottom line. “this is a budget blueprint, not a complete budget,” said trump’s budget director mick mulvaney, ahead of its release, promising a full buffet of data, forecasts, and details in the full budget in mid may. to be sure, budget experts were not expecting a hefty document. the trump administration had hinted it would be on the thin side of skinny. “it could be emaciated,” robert bixby, executive director of the concord coalition, a non partisan budget reform advocacy group, said in an interview on tuesday. “at some point, you’ve got to put your cards on the table, and show some numbers,” bixby said. maya macguineas, head of the committee for a responsible federal budget, said there were too few details to fully understand the larger choices ahead: “it is impossible to see the big picture when you only have a few pieces of the puzzle.” kenneth baer, a former associate director in obama’s office of management and budget, said an overly skinny budget would make it hard to interpret how the trump administration would spend taxpayers’ money.  “it’s sort of like building a house, but only putting up the front door,” baer said.

" the u.s. supreme court is set this week to hear a closely watched case testing the limits of religious rights, and new justice neil gorsuch’s judicial record indicates he could tip the court toward siding with a church challenging missouri’s ban on state funding of religious entities. trinity lutheran church, which is located in columbia, missouri and runs a preschool and daycare center, said missouri unlawfully excluded it from a grant program providing state funds to nonprofit groups to buy rubber playground surfaces. missouri’s constitution prohibits “any church, sect or denomination of religion” from receiving state taxpayer money. gorsuch, who embraced an expansive view of religious rights as a colorado based federal appeals court judge, on monday hears his first arguments since becoming a justice last week. he will be on the bench on wednesday when the justices hear the trinity lutheran case, one of the most important of their current term. gorsuch, appointed by president donald trump, restored the supreme court’s 5 4 conservative majority. trinity lutheran wanted public funds to replace its playground’s gravel with a rubber surface made from recycled tires that would be safer for children to play on. the u.s. constitution calls for a separation of church and state and guarantees the free exercise of religion. at the very least, a victory for trinity lutheran would help religious organizations nationwide win public dollars for certain purposes, such as health and safety. but it also could bolster the case for using public money for vouchers to help pay for children to attend religious schools rather than public schools in “school choice” programs backed by many conservatives. for example, colorado’s top court in 2015 found that a douglas county voucher program violated a state constitutional provision similar to missouri’s. trinity lutheran’s legal effort is being spearheaded by the alliance defending freedom conservative christian legal activist group, which argues missouri’s policy violates the u.s. constitution’s guarantees of free exercise of religion and equal protection under the law. if the church wins, “religious organizations cannot be excluded from general public welfare benefits that apply to everybody,” said erik stanley, an alliance lawyer representing the church. referring to gorsuch, stanley said, “he has definitely been a friend of religious liberty. so we are hopeful that will continue when he’s on the court, and we’re grateful he gets to participate on this important case.”  in 2013, gorsuch sided with the evangelical christian owners of arts and crafts retailer hobby lobby and allowed owners of private companies to object on religious grounds to a provision in federal healthcare law requiring employers to provide medical insurance that pays for women’s birth control. gorsuch wrote in a concurring opinion that hobby lobby’s owners faced a choice “between exercising their faith or saving their business.” the supreme court later affirmed the ruling. missouri said there is nothing unconstitutional about its grant program. “trinity lutheran remains free, without any public subsidy, to worship, teach, pray and practice any other aspect of its faith however it wishes. the state merely declines to offer financial support,” the state said in legal papers. the church has drawn support from the religious community including the u.s. conference of catholic bishops, the mormon church and jewish groups. groups filing legal papers opposing trinity lutheran, including the american civil liberties union, said government funding of churches is precisely what the constitution forbids. “forcing states to provide cash to build church property could open the floodgates to programs that coerce taxpayers to underwrite religion,” said daniel mach, director of the aclu’s program on freedom of religion and belief. mach said three quarters of the u.s. states have provisions like missouri’s. alliance defending freedom, which also opposes gay marriage, transgender protections and abortion, has another major case involving religion that the supreme court could take up in its term beginning in october. it represents a colorado bakery’s christian owner who argues the constitution’s promise of religious freedom means he should not have to make a wedding cake for a gay couple. trinity lutheran sued in federal court in 2012. the st. louis based 8th u.s. circuit court of appeals in 2015 upheld a trial court’s dismissal of the suit. the appeals court said accepting the church’s arguments would be “unprecedented,” noting the supreme court’s 2004 decision in the case locke v. davey that upheld a bar on washington state scholarships for students preparing for the ministry. the justice who gorsuch replaced, the late fellow conservative antonin scalia, was one of two dissenters in the locke ruling. when a state withholds a generally available benefit solely on religious grounds, it is like an unconstitutional “special tax” on religion, scalia said. judicial observers have described gorsuch as very much in the mold of scalia. missouri’s grant program was meant to keep tires out of landfills while also fostering children’s safety. the church’s brief to the high court stated, “a rubber playground surface accomplishes the state’s purposes whether it cushions the fall of the pious or the profane.” ",0
" leaders of the u.s. house of representatives probe of alleged russian interference in the 2016 u.s. election said on tuesday their investigation was continuing, they were working to obtain documents and they planned more public hearings. representative mike conaway, who is leading the probe, and representative adam schiff, the panel’s top democrat, made a joint media appearance about the ongoing investigation days after a dispute between republicans and democrats over republican calls to investigate actions by u.s. officials under former democratic president barack obama. “there are questions all of us want answered,” conaway told reporters. democrats accused president donald trump, and the committee’s chairman, republican representative devin nunes, of using concerns related to the obama administration to divert attention from allegations of collusion between trump’s campaign and russians attempting to interfere in the 2016 election. nunes, a close trump ally, recused himself from the russia investigation following a secret visit he paid to white house officials. schiff said the panel would like jeh johnson, who was homeland security secretary under obama, to testify in a public hearing and then in a classified session. schiff said he thought johnson “would have insight” into a statement by the intelligence community on oct. 7, 2016, about russia’s conduct as well as interactions he had with state and local officials about the dangers to the u.s. election system of russian activities. schiff said he had not yet been in touch with johnson on the matter. schiff said the committee was following up requests for information made to witnesses. “at least a couple” had declined to comply voluntarily, so the committee issued subpoenas last week, he said. the panel is putting together a schedule for interviewing witnesses, after it receives the documents it has requested, schiff added. schiff and conaway declined to take any questions from reporters.

" rival palestinian factions fatah and hamas agreed on wednesday to delay final transfer of power of the gaza strip from hamas to the western backed palestinian government by 10 days to dec. 10 to allow time to  complete arrangements , officials said. the factions signed a reconciliation deal brokered by egypt last month after hamas agreed to hand over administrative control of gaza, including the key rafah border crossing, a decade after seizing the enclave in a civil war. the deal bridges a bitter gulf between the western backed mainstream fatah party of palestinian president mahmoud abbas and hamas, an islamist movement designated as a terrorist group by western countries and israel. the agreement states that hamas, which has disbanded its administration, would complete the handover by december 1 but disputes over the transfer process have emerged in recent days and cairo has sent a senior security delegation to the territory to try to resolve the deadlock. in a brief joint statement, fatah and hamas said they had asked egypt to delay the timetable from dec 1 so that they could   complete the arrangements to successfully conclude reconciliation steps to which the palestinian people aspire . completion will also strengthen palestinian president mahmoud abbas s standing at any potential resumption of the stalled peacemaking process with israel, analysts say. it was initially unclear whether the deadline extension would prevent the 40,000 50,000 hamas hired employees being paid their november salaries on time.  hamas has demanded that abbas lift sanctions he has imposed on gaza such as slashing salaries of palestinian authority hired public servants and limiting electricity imported from israel for gaza.  the palestinian authority has demanded that it must have full control of gaza in order to be able to discharge its administrative powers there and failure to pay the salaries could endanger further reconciliation steps. earlier on wednesday, tension between the two factions rose when hamas refused to allow palestinian authority employees to return to their jobs at three ministries as instructed by the government.

" lebanon s shi ite hezbollah group on sunday accused saudi arabia of forcing lebanese prime minister saad al hariri to quit, and called for calm in an effort to contain the political crisis unleashed by his resignation. sayyed hassan nasrallah, the leader of iran backed hezbollah, said there should be no political escalation in response to hariri s declaration on saturday, which was made from saudi arabia and came as surprise even to his aides. hariri, in a televised speech, said there was a plot to kill him, and accused hezbollah and its iranian backers of sowing strife in the arab world.    nasrallah said  legitimate questions  were being asked over whether hariri had been detained in saudi arabia, where news emerged on sunday that royals, ministers and investors had been arrested in an anti corruption purge. aides to hariri, whose family made their fortune in the saudi construction industry, strongly denied he had been detained or had been forced to resign. speaking in a televised address, nasrallah said:  the resignation was a saudi decision dictated to prime minister saad al hariri and was forced on him.  nasrallah said lebanon s political leaders expected hariri to return to lebanon on thursday  if he is allowed  to travel.  sunni muslim saudi arabia, a political ally of hariri, is locked in a bitter tussle for power across the middle east with shi ite iran and its allies, including hezbollah. lebanese president michel aoun will not accept hariri s resignation until he returns to lebanon to explain his reasons, palace sources said on sunday, delaying for now the politically difficult consultations over his successor.  nasrallah said he would not comment on accusations leveled against hezbollah by hariri, describing his resignation announcement as a saudi statement. hariri s resignation toppled a coalition government that included hezbollah, thrusting lebanon back into the frontline of the saudi iranian regional rivalry and risking an open ended political crisis.  the government was formed late last year in a political deal that ended years of deadlock, and last month it produced lebanon s first budget since 2005. nasrallah said he had thought things were going well and had not wanted hariri to quit.  hariri allies in lebanon have denied suggestions he had been detained and a photograph was published on his twitter account showing him with saudi arabia s newly appointed ambassador to lebanon, walid al yaaqoub. news of high level arrests in saudi arabia fueled social media speculation in lebanon that hariri, a saudi national, was a target. nasrallah said  there was legitimate concern , asking if hariri had anything to do  with this internal struggle between the princes .    saudi oger, the construction firm owned by the hariri family, has faced a multibillion dollar debt restructuring. the company was hit by a decline in oil prices led to sharp state spending cuts in the kingdom.     saudi owned newspaper asharq al awsat cited unnamed sources close to hariri as speculating that he would probably remain outside lebanon because of the security threat against him. central bank governor riad salameh sought to calm fears the political turmoil would hit lebanon s already fragile economy, issuing a statement to reaffirm the stability of its currency, which is pegged against the u.s. dollar.    in lebanon s sectarian system the president must be a maronite catholic, the prime minister a sunni and the speaker of parliament a shi ite. hariri is lebanon s most influential sunni politician. his father, rafik al hariri, was prime minister after lebanon s 1975 1990 civil war and was assassinated in a car bombing in 2005.  a u.n. backed tribunal has indicted five hezbollah members for the killing but the group denies any involvement.  saudi media have published reports of a plot to assassinate hariri in recent days, but all of lebanon s main security branches have said they have no information about such a plot. a saudi minister said on saturday that hariri s personal security detail had  confirmed information  about the plot. thamer al sabhan said in an interview with a lebanese tv station on saturday that there were  threats against the prime minister and the kingdom is keen for his security . u.n. secretary general antonio guterres was concerned by hariri s resignation and hoped all sides in the country would back its state institutions, his spokesman on lebanon stephane dujarric said in an emailed statement.

" hamas  security chief in the gaza strip was wounded in a car bombing on friday in what the islamist group called a failed assassination attempt. the attack came as rival factions are trying to implement a new agreement meant to end a 10 year rift that has effectively split the palestinian territories between hamas in gaza and the more mainstream fatah in the occupied west bank. tawfeeq abu naeem, hamas  head of security in gaza and a strong supporter of the reconciliation deal, was lightly wounded when his car exploded outside a mosque, hamas said in a statement. hamas, which has been quick to blame israel for similar attacks in the past, did not say who it believed was behind the bombing, suggesting it could also be the work of a radical jihadist salafi group that opposes the palestinian rapprochement. asked about the explosion in gaza, israel s military said it did not comment on foreign reports. hamas has stepped up a security campaign against salafi groups and recently detained a senior operative. hamas also has improved ties with egypt, which is battling islamist groups across the border in the sinai peninsula. some disputes arose this week in implementing the reconciliation deal. senior fatah officials traveled to gaza this week from the west bank to take control of two government offices there, but they turned back, saying hamas officials refused their authority. a fatah spokesman later said the issue was being resolved.

" the u.s. defense department’s fiscal year 2017 budget requests $145.8 million in support for israel, including iron dome and other cooperative defense programs, according to pentagon documents released tuesday. the iron dome system is designed to defeat short range missiles and rockets. the united states will also continue to help fund david’s sling, a medium range missile interceptor, set to be deployed this year, as well as the arrow ballistic missile interceptor. the systems are meant to form a multi level shield that the israelis are developing with washington’s help as a bulwark against iran and its allies on the israeli border. the u.s. missile defense agency’s fiscal 2017 budget request  included $103.8 million for israeli cooperative programs, down from $267.6 million in fiscal 2016, plus $42 million for iron dome, down from $55 million in fiscal 2016. the budget forecast total spending on israeli cooperative programs of $540 million over the next five years, with no additional funding for iron dome envisioned after $42 million in fiscal 2017. vice admiral james syring, director of the u.s. missile defense agency, told reporters the agency was working with israel under a co production agreement signed for the iron dome system, with a “not insignificant” workshare going to u.s. firms. he declined to give the specific percentage share. syring said the united states and israel were working on a second co production agreement for the david’s sling program,  although he declined to give a timeframe for reaching a deal.  he said a test of the david’s sling system late last year exceeded expectations. raytheon co is working with israel’s state owned rafael advanced defense systems ltd on the iron dome and david’s sling programs.  syring said israel had not signaled any plans to request additional funds for missile defense programs, as it did last year, after the agency sent its budget request to congress. he said any decision on funding would be up to congress, which must approve the budget. robert scher, assistant defense secretary for strategy, plans and capabilities, told congress last year that the u.s. government had provided more than $3 billion to israel for work on david’s sling and other missile defense programs since 2001.

" a powerful u.s. lawmaker on wednesday demanded secretary of state john kerry provide an explanation of a $1.7 billion claim settlement paid to iran just as tehran released american prisoners last month. republican ed royce, chairman of the house of representatives foreign affairs committee, wrote that the timing of the settlement and the administration’s failure to brief congress “has led some to express concern that the payment represents a de facto ‘ransom’ for the release of american hostages.” royce asked kerry to provide by feb. 17 information including lists of all u.s. officials who participated in negotiations with iran over the settlement agreement, the prisoner release and the nuclear agreement announced in july. he also asked for legal analyses of the dispute, a timeline of negotiations over the dispute and an explanation of how the interest payment in the settlement was calculated, among other information. on jan. 17, the state department said the united states and iran had settled a longstanding claim at the iran u.s. claims tribunal, releasing to tehran $400 million in funds frozen since 1981 plus $1.3 billion in interest. state department spokesman john kirby said kerry would respond to the letter. he did not offer further specifics on when and how. “we can confirm receipt of chairman royce’s letter, and as with all congressional correspondence, we’ll respond as appropriate,” kirby said. u.s. republican lawmakers, who are strongly critical of democratic president barack obama’s iran policy, have been questioning the payment for weeks. no republican supported the nuclear agreement when congress had the opportunity to review it last year. after the settlement was announced, obama said it was a better alternative than letting more interest accumulate while waiting for a legal judgment.

" several states said on thursday they would move forward with legal challenges to a revised executive order signed by president donald trump this week that temporarily bars the admission of refugees and some travelers from a group of muslim majority countries. the new travel order, which is set to take effect on march 16, changed and replaced a more sweeping ban issued on jan. 27 that caused chaos and protests at airports. the first order was hit by more than two dozen lawsuits, including a challenge brought by washington state and joined by minnesota. in response to washington’s suit, u.s. district judge james robart in seattle ordered an emergency halt to the policy last month. that ruling was upheld by an appeals court in san francisco. washington state attorney general robert ferguson said on thursday he planned to ask robart to confirm that his ruling would also apply to trump’s revised order, which would halt it from being implemented. ferguson told a news conference the new order harmed a “smaller group” of individuals but that would not affect the state’s ability to challenge it in court.  he said the burden was on the trump administration to show that the court ruling from last month did not apply to its new policy.  a u.s. department of justice spokeswoman declined to comment on pending litigation. the government has said the president has wide authority to implement immigration policy and that the travel rules are necessary to protect against terrorist attacks. new york’s attorney general, eric schneiderman, said on thursday he would be joining washington’s lawsuit against the new ban and the state of oregon said it would join too.  the opposition comes on top of a separate legal challenge to the new ban brought by hawaii on wednesday. hawaii had also sued over the previous order and is seeking to amend its complaint to include the new ban. a hearing in that case is set for next wednesday, a day before the clock starts on the new order.     the states and immigration advocates argue the new ban, like the original one, discriminates against muslims. trump’s new executive order was designed with the intention of avoiding the legal hurdles.  while the new order keeps a 90 day ban on travel to the united states by citizens of iran, libya, syria, somalia, sudan and yemen, it excludes iraq.  refugees are still halted from entering the country for 120 days, but the new order removed an indefinite ban on all refugees from syria. the revisions include explicit exemptions for legal permanent residents or existing visa holders and waivers are allowed on a case by case basis for some business, diplomatic and other travelers.      the first hurdle for the lawsuits will be proving “standing,” which means finding someone who has been harmed by the policy. with so many exemptions, legal experts have said it might be hard to find individuals a court would rule have a right to sue.

" democratic front runner hillary clinton has a higher probability than her likely republican rival donald trump of becoming the next u.s. president, but the gap between the pair narrowed this week, according to the online political stock market predictit.  clinton’s probability on friday was 61 percent, down from 65 percent seven days ago, according to the site, which allows users to wager small amounts of money on “yes” or “no” predictions of future events. the probability that trump will win the nov. 8 election was 40 percent, up from 34 percent. trump’s sweeping victory in this week’s indiana primary prompted his remaining republicans rivals ted cruz and john kasich to drop out of the race, cementing the businessman’s status as the party’s presumptive nominee.  he is now testing out themes to use against clinton to persuade disgruntled republicans to get behind his campaign. on friday, he criticized her use of a private email server while she was u.s. secretary of state. predictit is jointly run by washington political consultancy aristotle and victoria university in wellington, new zealand. all of its users are registered u.s. voters.         as with polls, predictions markets like predictit do not always accurately forecast outcome. ninety days ago, its users gave trump a 20 percent probability of winning the presidency, illustrating how the celebrity businessman’s momentum was underestimated.  clinton is in a fight with u.s. senator bernie sanders for the democratic nomination and holds a clear lead in delegates.

" the bodies of 26 people believed killed after an ambush last week in eastern democratic republic of congo have been discovered, most of them with their hands tied and their necks broken, a local chief said on sunday. the victims disappeared a week ago after they were ambushed by militants on a main road in north kivu s restive beni territory, where more than 800 people were killed in dozens of massacres between 2014 and 2016. the attack, which followed a lull this year, has revived questions about the state s ability to impose order over eastern borderlands wracked by ethnic tensions and competition for mineral resources. congolese authorities and u.n. officials initially believed that about 20 civilians had disappeared after being attacked by armed assailants and were likely to have been killed. they were unable to locate the bodies for days, however, due to intense fighting. a group including officials from congo s u.n. mission monusco, the army, the congolese red cross, and congolese authorities traveled to the scene of the killings on sunday.  in total, 26 people   three women, 22 civilian men and one congolese soldier   were tied up and killed by breaking their necks,  saambili bamukoka, chief of beni s watalinga chiefdom, told reuters. a congolese military spokesman had earlier confirmed that the bodies had been discovered near the road, but did not know how many there were.  bodies were found in a state of decomposition,  said local army spokesman mak hazukay, adding that the road remained closed to civilian traffic.  we must first have the time to secure the surrounding area.   the day after the attack on the travelers, militants assaulted two nearby military bases, killing two u.n. peacekeepers and injuring 18 others. the army and u.n. peacekeeping mission blamed the raids on the allied democratic forces (adf), a ugandan islamist group active near the border. authorities have also accused the adf of carrying out nearly all the massacres of the past three years. but independent and separate u.n. experts say several armed groups as well as national army commanders have been involved in the killings as they vie for influence in congo s lawless eastern borderlands.  millions died in regional wars that ravaged eastern congo between 1996 2003 and spawned dozens of armed groups that continue to prey on local populations.

" a senior u.s. senator said on friday that he expects congress’ investigation of russia and the 2016 u.s. election to go ahead, even after the appointment of a special counsel, and said congress has a broader mandate that extends to financial conflicts of interest. the u.s. justice department on wednesday appointed robert mueller as special counsel to investigate alleged russian meddling in the 2016 u.s. presidential campaign and possible collusion between trump’s campaign and russia. “the congress has a broader oversight responsibility than just whether crimes have been committed,” senator ron wyden, the ranking democrat on the senate finance committee and a senior member of the senate intelligence committee, said during a round table meeting with reuters.  the senate intelligence committee is conducting one of the main congressional probes of the issue. “bob mueller doesn’t have, for example, the same broader responsibility to get into the kind of financial entanglements that i have especially focused on,” wyden said. questions remain about what contacts took place between trump advisers and the russians, and about russia investments in trump businesses.  in march, for example, the white house disclosed that trump’s son in law and white house senior adviser, jared kushner, met executives of russian state development bank vnesheconombank, or veb, in december. in february, trump’s national security adviser, michael flynn, was forced to resign for failing to disclose the content of his talks with sergei kislyak, russia’s ambassador to the united states, and then misleading vice president mike pence about the conversations. reuters reported on thursday that flynn and other advisers to trump’s campaign were in contact with russian officials and others with kremlin ties in at least 18 calls and emails during the last seven months of the 2016 presidential race. u.s. intelligence agencies said russia hacked emails of senior democrats and orchestrated the release of embarrassing information in a bid to tip the 2016 u.s. presidential election in favor of trump, whose views were seen as more in line with moscow’s. russia has denied the allegations. trump has dismissed suggestions of links with moscow as democratic sour grapes for losing the election. trump and his aides have repeatedly denied any collusion with russia. mueller’s appointment raised questions about whether he would ask congress to step away from its investigation, or whether the dual track would complicate issues such as calling witnesses or obtaining documents. some congressional republicans have also suggested that mueller’s appointment would lead to changes in congress’ investigation. wyden said he would “go to the mat” to be sure congressional investigators get what they need. he has already put a hold on trump’s nomination of sigal mandelker to the position of under secretary of the treasury for terrorism and financial intelligence until treasury hands over all documents related to financial dealings between russia, trump and trump associates. wyden also said he was looking into ways to obtain documents related to dealings with russia by flynn. the intelligence committee subpoenaed flynn for the documents on may 10. his lawyer said on thursday that flynn had not yet decided how to respond. wyden said he needed time to decide how to respond, but pledged he would do so. “we still have to know more ... about how russia corrupted our democracy,” he said. he said he knew that it would involve the department of justice.

" as a teenager in the early 1970s retired u.s. navy vice admiral robert s. harward played football and basketball, was popular with classmates and, like many american high school students, was known for partying. but harward, to whom president donald trump has offered the post of u.s. national security adviser, to succeed michael flynn, spent his teenage years not in his native rhode island, but in pre revolutionary iran, where his father, a navy captain, advised the iranian military. during his teenage years, harward lived in an iranian neighborhood, attended school with iranian american students and played sports against iranian teams. those experiences gave him an unusual familiarity with iran’s culture and people in the years before the 1979 islamic revolution that ousted the pro american shah. “during very formative years of his life, he was exposed to everything that was iran,” said joseph condrill, who knew harward, known by his classmates as bobby, when they were students at the tehran american school. “iran was one of our homes, and we got to know the iranian people very well, in a very intimate way.” the trump administration has offered harward the job of national security adviser, two u.s. officials familiar with the matter said on wednesday. it was not immediately clear if harward had accepted, the sources said. a white house spokesperson had no immediate comment. harward would carry his experience into the trump white house, charged with coordinating national security policy and responding to threats including iran’s ballistic missile program and support for militant groups in the middle east. while flynn put iran “on notice,” and trump has tweeted that iran is “playing with fire,” harward’s experience with iran is more personal. the revolution that brought iran’s theocratic government to power forced the closure of the tehran american school and cut short the tours of american families living in iran. rather than being isolated on a military base, harward and other americans at that time lived among iranians, rode local buses, and were exposed to iran’s attractions through field trips, his classmates said. “it was not a completely isolated culture for us,” said john martin, 61, of reston, virginia, who was in harward’s high school class and attended the u.s. naval academy with him. harward even picked up fluent persian while he was in iran, martin said. “for those of us that had once lived in iran, there’s an after effect, the effect of the islamic revolution,” condrill said. “there is definitely a sense of suspicion, if you will ... based upon that experience of the iran that we once knew.” it is not clear, however, how harward’s memories might influence u.s. policy, because the national security adviser’s job is to coordinate, not make, policy. in addition, administration officials said, trump advisers steve bannon and stephen miller have closer ties to the president than harward would have and would present a rival power center. in 2012, as deputy head of the u.s. central command, he told a conference that “iran’s well established past pattern of deceit and reckless behavior have progressively increased the potential for miscalculation that could spark a regional, if not a global conflict.” at the same event, he recalled with some wistfulness his own experience living in the region. “i think back to the days when i graduated from the tehran american school in 1974, where as a westerner i could freely travel through afghanistan, pakistan, india and other countries in the region and be greeted, and welcomed, because of the policies and strategy the west employed in the region,” he said. “yet i look today, we are in a much different world.” harward did not respond to a request for comment and officials at lockheed martin, where he is a top executive, declined to comment.        after graduating from high school in 1974, harward returned to the united states, joined the navy, became an elite seal and rose through the ranks, eventually serving as deputy commander of u.s. central command, which oversees american forces in the middle east. he served there under general jim mattis, now the u.s. defense secretary. earlier in his career, harward worked on counterterrorism as a military officer on the national security council, an assignment seen as a marker of a rising star. several former u.s. officials who worked with harward described him as experienced and smart, but not known for his personal experience with iran. he is well liked and respected and seen as unpretentious despite his distinguished military service, according to people who have worked with him.  “he was a very good and effective bureaucratic player,” said derek chollet, an assistant secretary of defense under the obama administration. “he understands the role the military plays within the broader tool set of american policy.” when harward was a commanding officer in afghanistan, he was known for making his rounds without full body armor to send a message that afghanistan was safe, said a u.s. official who worked under harward there. “he had no ego,” the official said, on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak.

" former soccer star george weah leads in partial presidential election results in 11 of liberia s 15 counties, the electoral commission said on thursday, after a vote meant to bring about the country s first democratic transfer of power in decades. early results from tuesday s poll read to reporters by the commission s chairman left weah s camp confident he would win the outright majority he needs to avoid a run off, even though most counties had reported tallies from less than a third of polling stations. the other favorite in the 20 candidate field, vice president joseph boakai, led in just one county, although he was running in second in most others.   i can say for sure that ambassador george manneh weah is going to be the next president of the republic of liberia,  weah s adviser mulbah morlu told reuters.  the people of liberia have spoken.  the final results must be announced by oct. 25 and a run off will be held next month if no one has won a majority.   before the commission s announcement, parties backing three other candidates alleged fraud and vowed to contest the results. but international observers said they had seen no major problems with the vote.  the overall conduct of the voting was generally assessed as either good or very good,  the eu mission said in a statement on thursday. observers from the u.s. based carter center and national democratic institute (ndi) also said they had not identified any major issues with the voting or subsequent counting. the allegations of irregularities centered on charges that extra ballots were printed in advance and marked with votes for boakai from the ruling unity party of president ellen johnson sirleaf. however, none of the parties provided evidence of cheating. a unity party leader declined to respond to the accusations. earlier in the day, johnson sirleaf, who became africa s first elected female president when she won a surprise victory in 2005 following a post war transition, hailed the election as historic.   we believe that all liberians are ready for this process. i thank them for participating in this process,  she told reporters. liberia, africa s oldest modern republic, was founded by freed u.s. slaves in 1847 but its last democratic power transfer occurred in 1944.

" the resurgence of australian nationalist politics has been halted at a state election in coal rich queensland, with pauline hanson s one nation party at risk of being almost completely wiped from the state assembly. australia s center left labor party is leading in the tight race after three quarters of votes were counted following saturday s poll, while hanson s party has yet to confirm victory in a single seat. the official result may not be known for several days although political analysts believe labor will win the 47 seats it needs to govern in queensland 93 seat assembly, a result that would allow it to form a government without support from independents or minor parties.  i am confident of a labor majority,  queensland s labor premier annastacia palaszczuk told reporters on sunday. hanson, a senator in the federal parliament, had anticipated a surge in support in her electoral heartland, to give momentum to the resurgence her anti immigration, populist party enjoyed  in the national election last year. but despite attracting support from around 14 percent of voters, one nation has not recorded decisive victories in individual seats. it is tipped to win just one seat in state parliament, according to analysis by the australian broadcasting corporation (abc). griffith university political analyst paul williams said despite a lack of seats, hanson s party had likely polled higher than 20 per cent in some regional seats.  all the anger, the disenchantment, the bitterness, the resentment to the major parties and elites, it s still as strong as it was 12 months ago,  he told reuters by telephone on sunday. the election has been held in one of australia s powerhouse mining states with debate over a a$16.5 billion ($12.6 billion) coal mine, rail and port project proposed by indian energy giant adani enterprises dominating much of the campaign. while both major parties support the queensland resources project, labor has vowed to veto a near billion dollar concessional loan adani has asked australia to provide for the proposed rail line, should it win government. the conservative opposition liberal national party, which the abc forecasts will win 41 seats, supports the government loan. hanson had been hoping her party would hold the balance of power in queensland, and with it the ability to decide who the next premier would be.  as the results rolled in late on saturday, she told reporters in buderim, an urban center near queensland s coast, that while disappointed with some of the emerging numbers, the fight would go on.     i think this is a clear indication that one nation is not going anywhere, we are going to be around for a while yet,  hanson said.

" invoking the spirit of the reformation, chancellor angela merkel called for religious freedom and tolerance on tuesday and said germany should lend extra support to the children of refugees  who have experienced awful things.   we have learned that tolerance is the soul of europe,  she said at a ceremony on the 500th anniversary of the reformation in wittenberg, where martin luther is said to have nailed his theses challenging catholicism to a church door. luther argued against what he saw as abusive practices by catholic preachers, though the reformation divided western christianity and resulted in violence, persecution and discrimination. merkel, the daughter of a protestant pastor, praised luther s translation of the bible into a standard form of written german, which she said made its teachings accessible to the population at large.  religious education was a fundamental concern of the reformation,  she said, stressing the importance of education for everyone.  to learn and develop skills, some children need to be given more support than others   for example when parental support is lacking. this applies too to integrating children from refugee families who have experienced and undergone awful things.  merkel has come under fire for allowing more than one million migrants to enter germany over the past two years   a decision that saw her conservatives bleed support to the anti immigration alternative for germany (afd) party in a national election last month. people from different backgrounds often knew too little about each other, she said, stressing the importance of dialogue between religions.  just as the freedom of belief always has to be protected from religious fanaticism, so freedom of worship, on the other hand, requires that religion be protected from contempt,  merkel added. to honor the 500th anniversary, reformation day was a public holiday in germany this year.

" several prominent saudi clerics have been detained in an apparent crackdown on potential opponents of the conservative kingdom s absolute rulers amid widespread speculation that king salman intends to abdicate in favor of his son. saudi sources told reuters that salman al awdah, awad al qarni and ali al omary were detained over the weekend. officials could not be reached or declined to comment. all three are outside the state backed clerical establishment but have large online followings. they have previously criticised the government but more recently kept silent or failed to publicly back saudi policies, including the rift with qatar over supporting the muslim brotherhood. awdah was imprisoned from 1994 99 for agitating for political change and leadership of the brotherhood inspired sahwa (awakening) movement. he later called for democracy and tolerance during the  arab spring  uprisings of 2011. saudi officials have dismissed reports that the king may soon pass the throne to crown prince mohammed bin salman, who already dominates economic, diplomatic and domestic policy. but the al saud family has always regarded islamist groups as the biggest internal threat to its rule over a country in which appeals to religious sentiment cannot be lightly dismissed and an al qaeda campaign a decade ago killed hundreds. in the 1990s, the sahwa demanded political reforms that would have weakened the ruling family.  mohammed bin salman is very likely to be the next king but any dissenting voices that could challenge this succession could also be considered destabilizing from the regime perspective,  said jean marc rickli, head of global risk at the geneva centre for security policy.  you put that in the context of the qatar rift and it is very difficult right now in the gulf to have an opinion that is not considered biased or adversarial because the situation is so polarized on all sides.  saudi arabia, the united arab emirates, bahrain and egypt cut diplomatic and transport links with qatar in june over its alleged support for islamist militants, a charge doha denies. in the past two years, crown prince mohammed has launched radical reforms to foster economic diversity and cultural openness, testing the kingdom s traditions of incremental change and rule by consensus. resistance has not been met kindly, with the authorities increasingly silencing independent actors, said stephane lacroix, a scholar of islam in saudi arabia.  it s a much broader attempt to crush islamists regardless of whether they act in opposition or not,  he said.  this (the arrests) would be [prince mohammed] and the regime trying to impose a much stricter political order.  the crackdown is not limited to islamists. civil liberties monitors say freedom of expression is increasingly constrained in gulf arab states including saudi arabia.  there is a general climate of being hypersensitive and almost paranoid,  said madawi al rasheed, visiting professor at the middle east centre, london school of economics.  there is no room for any kind of dissent at the moment.  the government toughened its stance following the arab spring after it averted unrest by increasing salaries and other state spending but the brotherhood gained power elsewhere in the region. the group represents an ideological threat to riyadh s dynastic system of rule, and its use of oaths of allegiance and secret meetings are anathema to the saudis. it was listed by riyadh as a terrorist organization in 2014 and diplomats and analysts say there is little prospect that would change. taking power in january 2015, king salman initially appeared willing to allow the brotherhood a role outside politics, for example by not stopping affiliated preachers such as awdah from speaking publicly on religious or social issues. that appears to have changed in recent months, as a shift in the official discourse targeted islamists and arrests increased, said lacroix.  what happened a couple of days ago is an acceleration of the process,  he said, although it is unclear what specifically prompted the detentions. awdah tweeted on friday welcoming a report that suggested the row between qatar and other arab countries may be resolved.  may god harmonize their hearts for the good of their people,  he wrote after a telephone call between crown prince mohammed and qatar s emir sheikh tamim bin hamad al thani. awdah comes from buraidah, heartland of the kingdom s ultra conservative wahhabi school of islam. criticism of the ruling family in the 1990s earned him praise from osama bin laden, whom he eventually denounced. his sahwa movement was later undermined by a mixture of repression and co optation.  some clerics, however, maintained large followings through youtube sermons. awdah has 14 million twitter followers. he supported resistance to u.s. forces in iraq as  jihad , or holy war, but then emerged as an ally in the government s campaign against violent jihadists. in 2011, awdah called for elections and separation of powers, principles antithetical to strict islamist ideology. he has since been largely quiet on issues of domestic reform. qarni, who was detained at home in abha in saudi arabia s south, had also expressed support for reconciliation with qatar, hopes for which were quickly dashed when saudi arabia ended any dialogue with qatar, accusing it of  distorting facts .  it seems today in saudi arabia that not supporting openly and enthusiastically what is happening against qatar basically makes you an agent of qatar,  said lacroix.  people who don t take a stance stand in the middle, and there s no middle ground for the saudis now.

" a british iranian charity worker serving a jail sentence in tehran received a letter from ex prime minister david cameron that showed she had ties to the british government, a prosecutor said on tuesday, according to mizan, the news site of the iranian judiciary. nazanin zaghari ratcliffe, a project manager with the thomson reuters foundation, a charity organization, is serving a five year jail sentence after being convicted of plotting to overthrow iran s clerical establishment. the prosecutor, abbas jafari dolatabadi, said the letter demonstrated zaghari ratcliffe s importance to the british authorities but he did not say when it was sent or provide any other details about it. a spokeswoman at the british foreign office said she was not immediately able to comment on whether cameron had written a letter, but confirmed that both he and his successor, theresa may, had raised the zaghari ratcliffe case with iranian authorities.  we will continue to raise all our dual national detainees, including mrs zaghari ratcliffe s case, with the iranian government at every available opportunity,  she added. zaghari ratcliffe was arrested by the elite revolutionary guards in april 2016 at a tehran airport, as she was about to return to britain with her two year old daughter after a family visit. her family and the thomson reuters foundation have both denied the charges against her. thomson reuters is a charity organization that is independent of thomson reuters and operates independently of reuters news. last week her family said iranian authorities had opened a new case against zaghari ratcliffe, leveling charges that could carry a sentence of 16 additional years in prison. the new charges include joining and receiving money from organizations working to overthrow the islamic republic, and attending a demonstration outside the iranian embassy in london, the family said. the foreign office spokeswoman referred reuters to a statement it issued last week in which it  expressed concern  that zaghari ratcliffe was facing additional charges and said it was seeking more information from the iranian authorities. on tuesday jafari dolatabadi also said zaghari ratcliffe was responsible for teaching online journalism for the bbc persian language service  with the goal of attracting and teaching individuals for propaganda operations against iran , mizan reported. francesca unsworth, director of the bbc world service group, said earlier this year that zaghari ratcliffe had never worked for the bbc s persian service.

" the small slovenian town of sevnica, melania trump’s birthplace, savored her husband’s shock win in the u.s. election as a likely boon for tourism on wednesday, while a former schoolmate remembered her as “creative and innovative”. until about a year ago, the town of fewer than 5,000 people, nestled in the foothills of the alps, was scarcely known in slovenia, let alone abroad.   but on monday, sevnica was clearly looking forward to a financial spin off from being the hometown of the 46 year old future u.s. first lady. “sometimes the pressure of the media was too hard. the people of sevnica are not used to it. on the other hand, the global attention is positive because sevnica is developing into a tourist destination,” mayor srecko ocvirk said. speaking to reuters shortly after 7 a.m. (0600 gmt) in sevnica’s central cafe, the smiling mayor said local residents had supported trump and his wife’s campaign. “we are very satisfied at the result,” he said. born melania knavs in 1970, she lived in an apartment block in sevnica with her family as a child. when she was a teenager, the family moved to a modest two storey house above the sava river on the outskirts of town, which sits below a well maintained medieval castle. residents say her father sold car parts and her mother worked for a factory that made a brand of children’s clothing very popular in communist yugoslavia, before the country fell apart in the 1990s. melania’s modeling career took her to milan and thence to the united states, far away from her native slovenia, a tiny former yugoslav republic of 2 million people comparable in size to new jersey. “even as a child melania was creative, innovative and sevnica was too small for her,” said mirjana jelancic, melania’s friend who is now a headmistress of melania’s elementary school. “she was reserved and when i heard that donald was running i said (to myself) this will be hard for her. she never wanted to be in the spotlight,” jelancic said. “she was excellent at her job (in the campaign).” the head of the town’s health center, which received a donation from melania in 2005 when she was pregnant with her son barron, said she believed melania would be a success in the white house, as well. “melania will be an excellent first lady who will take slovenian values of generosity, loyalty and trust to the united states and the world,” vladimira tomsic said.

" u.s. prosecutors on wednesday sought a prison sentence of 21 to 27 months for former u.s. congressman anthony weiner, who admitted to sending sexually explicit messages to a teenage girl in a “sexting” scandal that played a role in last year’s u.s. presidential election. “weiner, a grown man, a father, and a former lawmaker, willfully and knowingly asked a 15 year old girl to display her body and engage in sexually explicit conduct for him online,” prosecutors said in a filing in manhattan federal court. “such conduct warrants a meaningful sentence of incarceration.” a lawyer for weiner, who is scheduled to be sentenced by u.s. district judge denise cote next monday, could not immediately be reached for comment. in a court filing last week, weiner’s lawyers asked that he be sentenced to probation with no prison time, saying he acted out of the “depths of an uncontrolled sickness” for which he was now being treated. weiner, 53, pleaded guilty in may to transferring obscene material to a minor. the investigation into weiner’s exchanges with the teenage girl roiled the 2016 u.s. presidential campaign in its final days, when authorities found emails on weiner’s laptop from his wife huma abedin, an aid to democratic presidential candidate hillary clinton. abedin has filed for divorce. the discovery of the emails prompted james comey, then director of the federal bureau of investigation, to announce in late october that the agency was reopening its investigation into clinton’s use of a private email server while serving as u.s. secretary of state. clinton has said the announcement contributed to her upset loss to republican donald trump, who had accused her of endangering national security by using the private server. comey testified before congress in may that the emails found on weiner’s computer included classified information. trump fired comey in may amid the fbi’s probe into whether trump’s campaign colluded with russia to defeat clinton, a claim the president has denied. weiner served parts of new york city for 12 years in the u.s. house of representatives before resigning in 2011, when it emerged that he had exchanged sexually explicit messages with adult women. weiner and abedin’s son, now 5 years old, was born several months later. in 2013, weiner ran for new york city mayor, but was defeated in the democratic primary after more lewd messages became public.

" australian police on monday used metal cutters to remove five protesters who had chained themselves to the gate of the prime minister s official residence over the treatment of asylum seekers detained in papua new guinea. papua new guinea police last week expelled about 400 protesting asylum seekers from a shuttered australian run detention camp on manus island. the united nations decried the crackdown as  shocking . the manus island detention camp, and another in the south pacific island nation of nauru, have been cornerstones of australia s policy under which it refuses to allow asylum seekers arriving by boat to reach its shores. the policy, aimed at deterring people from making a perilous sea voyage to australia, has been heavily criticized by the united nations and human rights groups but has bipartisan political support in australia. but some people, including some christian groups, object to it.  it s our hope that as church leaders we can actually respond ... in non violent ways, in peaceful ways that actually highlight the issue and do justice to the beauty and the courage of the men on manus island,  said one of the protesters, jarod mckenna, who said he was a christian pastor. prime minister malcolm turnbull does not live in the official residence and he was not there during the three hour protest which ended when police ordered the five to keep still while the chains were cut from around their necks. they were then taken away in a police vehicle. there were no reports of injuries, police said. australia says allowing asylum seekers arriving by boat to reach its shores would only encourage people smugglers in asia and see more people risk their lives trying to reach australia. australia closed the manus island detention center on oct. 31, after it was declared illegal by a papua new guinea court. the asylum seekers, who have said they fear for their safety as well as being resettled in papua new guinea or another developing country, were taken to transit centers. australia has rejected an offer from new zealand to resettle 150 of the men, and is instead aiming to sending up to 1,250 of them to the united states under a swap deal.  so many people feel hopeless,  kurdish journalist and manus island detainee behrouz boochani told reuters by text message from one of the transit centers.         papua new guinea immigration and police officials did not return reuters  telephone calls or emails.

" u.s. president donald trump has opted not to set up a “war room” in the white house to serve as a rapid response team to answer accusations involving an investigation into his campaign’s ties to russia, a white house official said on tuesday. any such rapid response team, the official said, is instead likely to be a function of trump’s outside counsel, marc kasowitz. white house officials had been discussing the possibility of hiring former trump campaign manager corey lewandowski to spearhead an internal “war room” to battle the various controversies emanating from a justice department probe into contacts between trump aides and russia. “if it exists, it won’t be here,” the white house official told reuters. “it would most likely be outside the white house.” but it is possible, the official added, that the white house could beef up its rapid response operation as it does some retooling of trump’s communications effort. the official said it made more sense from a legal standpoint to have any russia war room operation outside of the white house. trump fired james comey, former director of the federal bureau of investigation, on may 9 amid accusations that the president was trying to squelch a federal probe into the russia claims. comey is to testify before the u.s. congress on thursday to lay out the details of his conversations with the president about russia before the firing. trump has called the probe a “witch hunt” and said there was no collusion between his campaign and russia.

" ramush haradinaj, a former guerrilla fighter who has twice stood trial for war crimes, was chosen on thursday to form a new government in kosovo, ending a political deadlock that has persisted since elections on june 11. president hashim thaci gave haradinaj the mandate after his coalition struck an agreement with a smaller party that paved the way for them to take power. haradinaj s coalition comprises parties made up of former guerrillas who fought serbian forces in 1998 and 1999. that campaign led to accusations of war crimes against him, but he was acquitted twice by a united nations war crimes tribunal. the coalition signed an agreement on monday with the smaller new alliance for kosovo (akr) party to put together a new government, an agreement that gives them 62 seats in the 120 seat parliament [nl8n1l42qo. the akr is led by behgjet pacolli, whom media call the richest man in kosovo.  haradinaj is expected to present his program to parliament on saturday, after which the government should be elected.   the new government will confront unemployment running at 30 percent and uncertain relations with kosovo s neighbors, especially serbia, a precondition for both countries to move forward in their efforts to join the european union. it must also reform health and education and the tax administration system as well as include representatives of some 120,000 kosovo serbs who do not recognize independence. kosovo declared independence from serbia in 2008, almost a decade after nato air strikes drove out serbian forces that had been accused of expelling and killing ethnic albanian civilians in a two year counter insurgency.

transition,  vatican spokesman greg burke said after the 15 minutes of talks, which were followed by an exchange of gifts. francis presented the general with a commemorative medal of his visit, and min aung hlaing gave the pope a harp in the shape of a boat and an ornate rice bowl, burke said. the army chief told the pope that  there s no religious discrimination in myanmar and there s the freedom of religion,  according to a statement on the facebook page of min aung hlaing.  every soldier s goal is to build a stable and peaceful country,  the army chief was paraphrased as saying in the statement.  members of ethnic minority groups in traditional dress welcomed francis at yangon airport, and children presented him with flowers as he stepped off his plane. he waved through an open window at dozens of children waving vatican and myanmar flags and wearing t shirts with the motto of the trip    love and peace    as he set off in a car. only about 700,000 of myanmar s 51 million people are roman catholic. thousands of them traveled by train and bus to yangon, and they joined crowds at several roadside points along the way from the airport to catch a glimpse of the pope. more than 150,000 people have registered for a mass that francis will say in yangon on wednesday, according to catholic myanmar church spokesman mariano soe naing.   we come here to see the holy father. it happens once in hundreds of years,  said win min set, a community leader who brought a group of 1,800 catholics from the south and west of the country.   he is very knowledgeable when it comes to political affairs. he will handle the issue smartly,  he said, referring to the sensitivity of the pope s discussions about the rohingya. large numbers of riot police were mobilized in yangon but there were no signs of any protests. the trip is so delicate that some papal advisers have warned francis against even saying the word  rohingya , lest he set off a diplomatic incident that could turn the country s military and government against minority christians. the rohingya exodus from rakhine state to bangladesh s southern tip began at the end of august, when rohingya militants attacked security posts and the myanmar army launched a counter offensive. u.s. secretary of state rex tillerson last week called the military operation  ethnic cleansing  and threatened targeted sanctions for  horrendous atrocities . myanmar s government has denied most of the accusations made against it, and the army says its own investigation found no evidence of wrongdoing by troops. myanmar does not recognize the rohingya as citizens nor as members of a distinct ethnic group with their own identity, and it even rejects the term  rohingya  and its use. many people in myanmar instead refer to members of the muslim minority in rakhine state as illegal migrants from bangladesh.  francis is expected to meet a group of rohingya refugees in dhaka, capital of bangladesh, on the second leg of his trip. the most tense moments of his myanmar visit were expected to be the private meeting with the army chief and, separately, with civilian leader aung san suu kyi on tuesday. vatican sources say some in the holy see believe the trip was decided too hastily after full diplomatic ties were established in may during a visit by suu kyi. suu kyi s reputation as a nobel peace prize laureate has been tarnished because she has expressed doubts about the reports of rights abuses against the rohingya and failed to condemn the military. the pope has already used the word rohingya in two appeals from the vatican this year.  asked if he would say it in myanmar, burke said francis was taking the advice he had been given seriously, but added:  we will find out together during the trip ... it is not a forbidden word . a hardline group of buddhist monks, previously known as ma ba tha, said it welcomed the pope s visit but warned, without elaborating, of  a response  if he spoke openly about the rohingya.  i hope he doesn t touch on sensitive issues that myanmar people couldn t accept,  said tawparka, a spokesman for the group, who goes by a single name.  there s no problem if he talks about islam, but it s unacceptable if he speaks about rohingya and extreme terrorists.

" a u.s. house committee investigating whether russia has tried to influence u.s. public opinion on fossil fuels asked facebook (fb.o), twitter (twtr.n) and alphabet (googl.o) on wednesday to turn over information about russian entities that may have bought anti fracking advertisements.   house science and technology committee chairman lamar smith, a texas republican and climate change denier, asked the ceos of the technology companies to turn over documents by oct. 10 that detail the involvement of russian based or funded entities detected on their platforms, information on ads they purchased, and any communications concerning ads advocating for “so called green initiatives.” smith and the republicans on the committee that oversees u.s. scientific agencies have targeted mainstream climate change scientists, questioning their integrity and calling for eliminating federal funding for climate research. they have also accused environmental groups of colluding with russians to push for regulations to curb fossil fuel extraction. “the committee is concerned that divisive social media and political messages conveyed through social media have negatively affected certain energy sectors, which can depress research and development in the fossil fuel sector and expanding potential for natural gas,” smith wrote in letters to the ceos. the committee, which oversees u.s. scientific agencies, believes such anti fracking ads reflect “the russian government’s concern about the impact of fracking ... on the global energy market and potential challenges to profitability” of russian energy companies, the letter said. the letter says russia’s meddling in the u.s. energy market has been “well documented in the public domain” and seeks information similar to what facebook is providing to the u.s. senate about anti immigration propaganda and advertising. both parties in washington have been stepping up scrutiny of major internet firms, and considering whether to create new disclosure rules for online political ads after facebook revealed this month that suspected russian trolls purchased more than $100,000 worth of divisive ads on its platform during the 2016 election cycle. the u.s. federal bureau of investigations is probing whether president donald trump’s campaign colluded with russia to influence the election. trump and officials from the campaign have said there was no collusion. smith is dismissive of local and national protests that have emerged around the country objecting to the process of horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing to extract oil and gas because of its affect on water quality, as well as the construction of pipelines to transport fracked oil and gas.

" getting more americans to enroll for health insurance under president barack obama’s healthcare law known as obamacare is a top priority of his administration until president elect donald trump takes office on jan. 20, the white house said on thursday. “we would be focused on ... maximizing the opportunity that currently is available for millions of americans to go to healthcare.gov during the open enrollment period and sign up for healthcare,” white house spokesman josh earnest told a news briefing. sylvia burwell, the secretary of the u.s. department of health and human services, tweeted on thursday that nov. 9 was healthcare.gov’s best day with 100,000 sign ups since it began selling the 2017 obamacare plans on nov. 1. the government’s goal is for more than 13.8 million sign ups initially. trump has said that he plans to repeal obamacare, formally known as the affordable care act. insurers have said that 2017 obamacare plans will remain in place and that any changes would affect 2018 plans. earnest said that people should not worry about what could happen to the healthcare exchanges under the trump administration. “these are benefits that are available to them today. we certainly would encourage people to sign up and capitalize on the good opportunity that’s there,” he said. obama met with trump on thursday for the first time in a one on one, 90 minute meeting in the white house oval office.    trump also released a review of his goals to overhaul healthcare on his website, reiterating that he would repeal the affordable care act. trump’s pledge to repeal obamacare may not be easy. he does not have the votes in congress for an outright repeal and will have to cut away at its financing first, health policy experts say.

" an intense and sustained push by u.s. evangelicals helped drive president donald trump s decision to recognize jerusalem as israel s capital and eventually relocate the u.s. embassy there, activists said on wednesday.  while trump had long pledged to move the embassy, the republican president s conservative christian advisers repeatedly pressed the case in regular meetings at the white house, the conservative activists said.  i have no doubt that evangelicals played a meaningful role in this decision,  said johnnie moore, a california pastor who serves as a spokesman for a council of leading evangelicals that advises the white house.  i don t believe it would have happened without them.  the white house did not respond to requests for comment. many u.s. evangelicals have expressed strong solidarity with conservatives in israel and feel a connection rooted in the bible to the jewish state.        conservative christians have long argued that formally recognizing jerusalem, home to sites holy to the muslim, jewish and christian religions, was long overdue following a 1995 congressional mandate to move the embassy from tel aviv. in trump and vice president mike pence, they found their most sympathetic audience. activists  efforts included an email campaign launched by the group my faith votes. the group is chaired by mike huckabee, the former republican presidential candidate and father of sarah huckabee sanders, the white house press secretary. the group posted a form on its website and urged people to contact the white house to press for recognition of jerusalem as the capital. another evangelical group, american christian leaders for israel, which includes conservative activists gary bauer and penny nance, sent a letter to trump warning that time was of the essence in moving the embassy. trump s decision to recognize jerusalem as the capital was  criticized by palestinian leaders and others in the international community, who fear it will spark unrest in the region. palestinians want east jerusalem as the capital of their future state. no other country has its embassy in jerusalem.  in june, trump, like presidents bill clinton, george w. bush and barack obama before him, signed a waiver delaying the embassy move to jerusalem in the hope of boosting his nascent efforts at brokering a peace accord between israel and the palestinians. with a deadline approaching for another such waiver, evangelical advocates saw a window to increase the pressure. american christian leaders for israel, in the letter to trump posted on its website, said they were  gravely concerned that with every passing day it will become more difficult to move the embassy and if you do not do it now, it may never happen.  trump first convened a circle of evangelical advisers during his presidential campaign, and he was the overwhelming favorite of white evangelical voters in last year s election.     moore, a member of the evangelical group advising the administration, said a prominent christian conservative was in the white house just about every day. much of the access comes through the office of public liaison and its deputy director, jennifer korn, whose portfolio includes faith groups.  i ve sat in many meetings with evangelicals in the white house since the administration began, and i can tell you this issue came up again and again and again,  moore said. he said evangelicals made it clear to the white house that it was a priority of theirs and they wanted action soon. jerry falwell jr., president of liberty university and a close trump adviser, said he had never talked to the president about the issue but had received emails from other leading evangelicals in the past several days  asking me to support this or tweet that, and try to get the word out.   the faith community has talked to the administration for months and months about the need to recognize jerusalem as the capital of israel,  said robert jeffress, pastor at first baptist church in dallas and an evangelical adviser to trump.  but the fact is, we didn t have to do any convincing of this administration. this was a campaign promise that president trump was happy to keep because he feels that way,  jeffress said in a telephone interview with reuters on wednesday.

" germany and europe want to ensure that new u.s. sanctions against russia do not lead to a new  ice age  in ties between russia and the west, german foreign minister sigmar gabriel said on tuesday. gabriel said he spoke with u.s. secretary of state rex tillerson about the sanctions in a meeting in washington, adding that he was grateful that u.s. president donald trump had agreed to coordinate on further measures with u.s. allies.  we as europeans have great concerns that this will have unintended consequences for europe. we don t want to completely destroy our business relations with russia, especially in the energy sector,  gabriel said. trump this month approved new sanctions on moscow for its 2014 annexation of ukraine s crimea peninsula and for what u.s. intelligence agencies say was its meddling in the u.s. presidential election, a charge russia denies. gabriel has criticized the united states for the move, saying the new punitive measures expose european companies involved in energy projects in russia to fines for breaching u.s. law. economy minister brigitte zypries even urged the eu to retaliate against the united states if the new sanctions on russia should end up penalizing german firms. gabriel said european leaders were concerned that the latest sanctions would not only have economic consequences, but could also  lead to a new ice age between russia and the united states and the west.  despite european concerns about the sanctions, gabriel insisted that moscow must do its part to implement a fragile ceasefire agreement in place for eastern ukraine, including the withdrawal of heavy weapons.  that would be a starting point for improved relations,  gabriel said. kurt volker, the newly appointed u.s. special representative for ukraine, told broadcaster deutsche welle, that washington would not forge any agreement with moscow  over the heads of the ukrainians or behind the backs of the europeans.   the u.s. has made clear we fully support the normandy process, and it s not our intention to become a part of it or to try to go over the top of it,  volker told deutsche welle. he acknowledged russian concerns about washington s decision to consider arming ukraine in the conflict, but said it was  quite reasonable for ukrainians to want to be better able to defend themselves.  german chancellor angela merkel and french president on monday called for russia and ukraine to increase their efforts to implement the ceasefire agreement. the conflict between ukrainian forces and russian backed separatists has claimed more than 10,000 lives since it erupted in 2014. germany and france have tried to convince both sides to implement a peace deal agreed in minsk in 2015 under the so called normandy process but with little success so far. merkel told reporters on tuesday that sanctions against russia would be lifted when the situation in eastern ukraine improved.

" an emboldened mexico hardened its opposition to president donald trump on friday by saying it would retaliate if the united states imposed a border tax and that it can afford to lose financial aid that might be pulled to pay for a border wall. foreign minister luis videgaray said mexico could respond to any tax the united states were to unilaterally impose on imports from its southern neighbor to finance the wall with levies on select goods, aimed at u.s. regions most dependent on exports south of the border. “without a doubt, we have that possibility, and what we cannot do is remain with our arms crossed,” videgaray said in a radio interview. “the mexican government would have to respond.” the statements by videgaray and interior minister miguel angel osorio chong, who minimized the potential impact of the rumored loss of u.s. security aid, toughened the defiant tone from mexico since president enrique pena nieto last month canceled a trip to meet trump over the wall dispute. mexicans are angry at trump’s calls for u.s. firms not to invest south of the border, insults to immigrants and threats to make mexico finance the border wall. the peso currency has weakened on concerns he will hurt latin america’s no. 2 economy.  pena nieto had faced criticism he was too accommodating with trump but got a much needed ratings boost after cancelling the summit. a plan to deport third country nationals to mexico fueled outrage this week. mexican officials were publicly blunt with u.s. secretary of state rex tillerson and homeland security john kelly over trump’s immigration and trade proposals in a visit to mexico on thursday.  osorio chong told local radio that mexican officials’ rejection of trump’s bid to send non mexican illegal migrants from the united states to mexico was “very clear.” “they asked us if (non mexican illegal immigrants) could be here while they are going through the legal process there. we said that there was...absolutely no way.”  videgaray said the trade strategy would replicate a 2009 campaign of retaliatory tariffs that helped mexico win a dispute with the united states. on wednesday, the minister mentioned iowa, texas and wisconsin as states that could be targeted in a conversation with lawmakers leaked to two newspapers. “this is not our preference,” he said. “mexico believes in free trade.” a u.s. executive order on jan. 25 that mandated the construction of a border wall also required government agencies to report the financial assistance they gave mexico in the past five years, leading to speculation trump wants to redirect the aid to pay for its construction.  osorio chong said on friday that mexico had no need for such financial aid from the united states, signaling that it would not come close to paying for the estimated $21.6 billion cost of the wall.  like in other middle income emerging economies, many in mexico consider it humiliating to take aid from wealthy countries. a large part of u.s. aid to mexico comes through the plan merida program, under which the u.s. congress allocated $2.6 billion to security assistance between 2008 and 2016.  of that, $1.6 billion had been disbursed by november 2016, according to the u.s. congressional research service. “when they realize what’s left of merida, they will understand that it’s not even that significant,” osorio chong told local radio. “we don’t object to them moving these resources... mexico now has its own capabilities,” he said. the u.s. customs and border protection agency said on friday it will accept proposals next month for the design of trump’s wall, a first step in picking vendors. videgaray said a meeting of tillerson, kelly and pena nieto in mexico city was a short courtesy visit.  he said in a more substantial meeting of the ministers, kelly told him that deportations of undocumented immigrants from the united states would not be militarized, after trump characterized the process as a “military operation.” ",0
" at least 31 migrants died after their boat sank off libya s western coast on saturday and some 200 others were picked up by the coastguard to be brought back to port in tripoli, officials said. the migrants were on two boats off the coast near garabulli, east of tripoli, one of which had already sunk when the coastguard arrived at the scene, said abu ajala amer abdelbari, a coast guard commander.  the boat had sunk and they were spread out in the sea, they were trying to swim towards the coast,  he said.  there were about 60 people who we were able to save because they were clinging to the (remains of the) boat.  another 140 migrants were picked up from the second boat, he said. the dead, including a number of children, were brought back to tripoli naval base where they were unloaded in white plastic body bags.  libya is the main departure point for mostly african migrants trying to cross to europe. smugglers usually pack them into flimsy inflatable boats that often break down or sink.  most migrants are picked up by international vessels and taken to italy, where more than 115,000 have landed so far this year, although an increasing number are intercepted by libya s european backed coastguard and returned to the north african country. since july, there has been a sharp drop in crossings, though this week has seen a renewed surge in departures.  nearly 3,000 migrants are known to have died or be missing after trying to cross to europe by sea this year, the majority of them between libya and italy. the international organization for migration said on friday that since 2000 the mediterranean had been  by far the world s deadliest border  for migrants.

" japan is considering refitting the izumo helicopter carrier so that it can land u.s. marines f 35b stealth fighters, government sources said on tuesday, as tokyo faces china s maritime expansion and north korea s missile and nuclear development. japan has not had fully fledged aircraft carriers since its world war two defeat in 1945.  any refit of the izumo would be aimed at preparing for a scenario in which runways in japan had been destroyed by missile attacks, and at bolstering defense around japan s southwestern islands, where china s maritime activity has increased. three government sources close to the matter said the japanese government was keeping in sight the possible future procurement of f 35b fighter jets, which can take off and land vertically, as it looks into the remodeling of the izumo. the 248 metre (814 feet) izumo, japan s largest warship equipped with a flat flight deck, was designed with an eye to hosting f 35b fighters. its elevator connecting the deck with the hangar can carry the aircraft, the sources said.  possible refitting measures included adding a curved ramp at the end of the flight deck, improving the deck s heat resistance against jet burners, and reinforcing the ship s air traffic control capability, they said. however, japanese defence minister itsunori onodera said the government was not taking any concrete steps towards refitting the izumo.  regarding our defense posture, we are constantly conducting various examinations. but no concrete examination is under way on the introduction of f 35b or remodeling of izumo class destroyers,  onodera told reporters on tuesday. the izumo has a sister ship called the kaga. japan has frequently conducted joint drills with u.s. aircraft carriers in recent months to boost deterrence against north korea.  one of the three government sources called such exercises  a great opportunity to see with our own eyes how the u.s. military operates their aircraft carriers  as japan looks into the possible conversion of the izumo into an aircraft carrier. regional tension has soared since north korea conducted its sixth and largest nuclear test in september. pyongyang said a month later it had successfully tested a new intercontinental ballistic missile that could reach all of the u.s. mainland. japan is also wary of china s long range missiles, and would like to secure measures to launch fighters from aircraft carriers in case runways operated by u.s. forces in japan or by japan s air self defence force were destroyed by missiles. article 9 of japan s pacifist constitution, if taken literally, bans the maintenance of armed forces. however, japanese governments have interpreted it to allow a military exclusively for self defense. owning an aircraft carrier could raise a question of constitutionality, the sources said, so the government is set to address the issue in its new national defence programme guidelines to be compiled by the end of 2018.

" the u.s. house of representatives on thursday passed a $1.2 trillion bill to fund most government activities in the fiscal year beginning oct. 1, knowing the senate will disagree with many controversial elements and force a negotiation that could stretch into december. the bill, passed by a 211 198 vote largely along party lines in the republican controlled house, provides $658.1 billion for the department of defense and $44.3 billion for the department of homeland security, including roughly $1.6 billion for construction of physical barriers along the u.s. mexican border. the $31.4 billion allotted for the department of the interior, the environmental protection agency (epa), the forest service, the indian health service and related agencies cut the epa’s funding by $534 million when compared to the prior fiscal year. the funding measure also included a provision that would stop the internal revenue service from implementing a provision of the 2010 affordable care act, commonly known as obamacare, that imposes a tax penalty on individuals who elect to go without health insurance. representative kevin mccarthy, a member of republican leadership, said the funding measure would make “major changes to the way washington spends taxpayer dollars.” “our funding legislation forces the government to do what it ought to do and to stop doing what it shouldn’t do,” mccarthy said in a statement, praising it for “strengthening our national defense, veterans’ programs, and border security,” and “cutting abusive washington agencies like the irs and the epa.” democrats warned that the bill, which bundled together 12 separate funding measures and earned just one democratic vote, would need substantial revision in the senate, where republicans hold 52 of 100 seats but most legislation requires 60 votes for passage. “these bills cannot be enacted into law because they cannot gain democratic votes,” democratic representative nita lowey said in a statement, calling the house passed bill “inadequate and partisan.”   ",0

" the united states does not aim to impede european trade and business transactions with iran despite president donald trump s decision last week to decertify the 2015 nuclear agreement, secretary of state rex tillerson told the wall street journal. european union leaders in brussels on thursday highlighted the need to protect their companies and investors dealing with iran from any adverse effects should washington reinstate sanctions against iran, officials said.  the president s been pretty clear that it s not his intent to interfere with business deals that the europeans may have under way with iran,  tillerson told the journal in an interview thursday.  he s said it clearly:  that s fine. you guys do what you want to do.  trump last week adopted a harsh new approach to iran by refusing to certify its compliance with the nuclear deal struck with the united states and five other powers including britain, france and germany. the republican president gave congress 60 days to decide whether to reimpose economic sanctions on iran, lifted under the pact in exchange for scaling down a program the west fears was aimed at building a nuclear bomb, something tehran denies.  trump has criticized the nuclear accord as  the worst deal ever  and has vowed to withdraw if congress and european allies do not address his problems with it. tillerson s comments appeared aimed at reassuring the europeans that washington is not trying to pressure them into avoiding business with iran.  we ve been working with the europeans for six months,  tillerson said.  they have been brought along with this same thought process. it doesn t mean that they necessarily agree entirely with it. ... now we will start a more formalized process with them now that the policy s been adopted.  the journal said tillerson would not discuss the multibillion dollar deals reached by boeing co (ba.n) under the 2015 accord. boeing, which was the first major u.s. company to announce a major business venture with iran, last year agreed to sell dozens of commercial planes to tehran.

" the u.n. human rights council agreed on thursday to send experts to work with burundi s government in pursuing perpetrators of  deplorable crimes  but the european union and united states criticized the resolution. they said the last minute move presented by african nations failed to take into account the conclusions of an existing probe which accused senior burundian officials of atrocities that may amount to crimes against humanity. that commission said there are reasonable grounds to believe crimes against humanity have been committed since april 2015 when president pierre nkurunziza said he would seek a third term in office. the opposition said he was acting unconstitutionally. a government crackdown on protests followed and the ensuing upheaval triggered a food crisis and the exodus of over 400,000 refugees. the african text, supported by bujumbura s delegation, was adopted by a vote of 23 states in favor, 14 against, with nine abstentions at the 47 member geneva forum.  the text in no way reflects the scale or severity of the situation in burundi,  latvia s ambassador janis karklins said on behalf of the eu.  it doesn t take into account the conclusions of the investigation team and no follow up is provided to them.  the last minute maneuver by the african group, led by tunisia,  presents a dangerous precedent for the council , he said.  it was unclear if an eu resolution on burundi, which would extend the mandate of the existing u.n. inquiry, could survive in some form after the african resolution.  the council is expected to decide on the eu resolution before its three week session ends on friday. the united states voiced deep disappointment at what it called the african resolution s failure to address the grave human rights situation in burundi.  due to severe restrictions on space for civil society and independent media, the commission of inquiry serves as a critical and credible source of information and must be able to continue its work,  u.s. diplomat jason mack said.  we remind this council that after conducting more than 500 interviews the commission found reasonable grounds to believe that crimes against humanity have been committed in burundi and the government of burundi continues to engage in extrajudicial killing, torture, arbitrary detention, enforced disappearances and sexual violence,  he said. the human rights council  should not support any mechanism short of a commission of inquiry or this council further risks diminishing its credibility as the primary mechanism for protecting and promoting human rights , mack added. burundi s ambassador renovat tabu declined to comment after the vote, but earlier told the council that the eu had  a hidden agenda  against his country.  the (burundi) government has already achieved substantial progress in improving the human rights situation as well as building the rule of law, and in the fight against impunity and is determined to continue its efforts to move forward,  he said.

" president donald trump on monday tapped republican commissioner ajit pai to head the u.s. federal communications commission, which is expected to roll back many of the obama administration’s telecommunications and internet policies. pai, a former justice department, fcc and capitol hill staffer, in december predicted landmark “net neutrality” rules adopted in 2015 would not last. the son of indian immigrants who grew up in kansas, pai said the commission should take a “weed whacker” to unneeded rules and was harshly critical of many fcc regulations imposed during the obama administration. “during the trump administration, we will shift from playing defense at the fcc to going on offense,” he said in december. “we need to fire up the weed whacker and remove those rules that are holding back investment, innovation, and job creation.” pai will also have a key role in deciding whether to approve or reject or impose conditions on mergers involving cable and telephone companies. in may, pai opposed fcc conditions imposed on charter communication’s acquisition of time warner cable. last week, then fcc chairman tom wheeler urged republicans against dismantling internet access protections that bar service providers from slowing consumer access to web content. internet providers fear net neutrality rules make it harder to manage internet traffic and make investment in additional capacity less likely. the republican controlled congress is also considering rewriting the net neutrality rules. pai said in 2015 that consumers would be worse under net neutrality and should “expect their bills to go up, and they should expect that broadband will be slower going forward.” senator maria cantwell, a washington state democrat, criticized pai in a letter to president donald trump monday as “not a supporter of the fcc’s strong rules to protect an open internet, putting at risk our robust net neutrality rules and the three million internet economy jobs it supports.” under wheeler, the fcc and major telecom and cable companies have been at odds over a number of big issues in recent years, including tougher broadband privacy rules and a proposal to allow pay tv consumers to ditch set top boxes. comcast corp, at&t inc, verizon communications inc, frontier communications corp, t mobile us inc and charter all praised pai’s appointment in separate statements. “chairman pai will work with his fellow commissioners to quickly and decisively put back in place the commonsense regulatory framework necessary to support the president’s agenda,” at&t said. however, advocacy group free press president craig aaron said pai “has been on the wrong side of just about every major issue that has come before the fcc during his tenure. he’s never met a mega merger he didn’t like or a public safeguard he didn’t try to undermine.” u.s. telecom, an industry trade group, said in a statement it shares pai’s vision for a “future based on a bold but pragmatic strategy to erase the many regulatory barriers impeding the expansion of our nation’s communications infrastructure, and the jobs and economic opportunity that depend on it.” pai does not need senate confirmation as chairman but his current term expires at year end and he will need to be reconfirmed to continue.

" indonesian police on friday started questioning the owner of a fireworks factory destroyed in a series of explosions and a fire that killed 47 workers and injured dozens, leaving some with horrific burns covering up to 80 percent of their bodies. in one of indonesia s worst industrial disasters, many workers were unable to escape the fire at the plant in tangerang, an industrial and manufacturing hub near jakarta, on thursday. police and residents broke holes in the walls to help trapped workers forced back by the intense heat from the blaze. on friday, a pile of sacks was still smoldering as forensics experts searched for human remains. the disaster will throw a new focus on safety standards at workplaces in indonesia, where rules are often poorly enforced.  police said the owner of the fireworks company, pt panca buana cahaya sukses, had returned to indonesia to be questioned, along with seven witnesses, mostly administrative staff at the factory.  when he heard about the incident at the factory he was in malaysia and he flew back straight away and went straight to tangerang police,  jakarta police spokesman argo juwono told metro tv. earlier, tangerang police chief harry kurniawan told reuters the cause of the fire was still being investigated and denied reports that the factory gates were locked.  responding to a report that underage workers were employed at the plant, kurniawan said investigations had not shown this to be the case. hospital records seen by reuters showed two of the injured were aged 15 and 16.  tangerang general hospital is treating 12 patients, some for burns over 40 percent to 80 percent of their bodies, said a spokesman, yudi firmansyah.    we are expecting treatment to take a long time,  firmansyah added.  first there s the life saving stage, then further treatment to prevent infections, and cosmetic procedures.  ayani, who goes by one name, wept when she saw her severely burnt daughter, nuhayati, 35, lying on a hospital bed.  her skin has been burned off completely,  she said, pointing to her forearms, torso and legs, and adding that her daughter had started working at the plant a month ago.  she only had some hair on her head, but her skin is almost gone.  officials have warned that the death toll could rise, with police saying three people were still unaccounted for. there were some narrow escapes at the factory, staffed mainly by young women paid about $3 a day. fitri, 18, told kompas media she survived by submerging herself in a large tub of water used to clean equipment, along with four workers.  if we stay here, we won t be safe,  she eventually told her friends, before climbing a 3 metre (10 ft) wall beside the tub and breaking through the roof. then residents used a ladder to help her descend.the report said the fire was thought to have started in a holding area next to the front gate where fireworks were stored.         victims in orange body bags were taken to a police hospital in east jakarta for identification by families. sugeng priyanto, an official at the ministry of manpower, told metro tv a team was investigating safety standards at the warehouse, which had been operating for a few months. tangerang regent ahmed zaki said the company had a permit to pack and wrap fireworks, though not produce them at the warehouse, which was close to a school and housing. earlier he had said it had a manufacturing permit. the disaster illustrated the low safety awareness in indonesia, jakarta based concord consulting said in a daily report.   regulations may be in place officially, but too often are simply ignored, resulting in high levels of complacency,  it said.

" u.s. lawmakers sharply criticized president barack obama’s administration on thursday over the disappearance of a former guantanamo detainee, calling for an end to transfers from the prison because of fears former prisoners could launch attacks on americans. they also raised concerns about reports that jihad diyab, a syrian among six detainees resettled in uruguay in december 2014, has disappeared and may now be in brazil. obama is working to close the u.s. military prison at guantanamo bay, where terrorism suspects have been held for 15 years, by transferring detainees not considered security threats to foreign countries. republican lawmakers worry that the obama administration is so eager to close the prison before he leaves office in january that it is sending detainees to countries that cannot ensure they will not return to the battlefield by joining militant groups that target americans and u.s. allies. “you’re talking about detainees who have every intent of killing american families,” republican representative joe wilson of south carolina said at a house of representatives foreign affairs committee hearing. the administration has considered sending guantanamo detainees to a prison in south carolina. the new york times reported that diyab said last month he was going on a religious retreat that would last into next week, and would be unreachable by telephone or email. since then, some uruguayan officials said they lost track of him and suggested he may have traveled to brazil, the newspaper reported. “many countries just aren’t up to the job,” said republican representative ed royce, the committee’s chairman. “... yet the administration has sent guantanamo terrorists to these countries anyway.” republican and some democratic committee members sharply questioned lee wolosky, the state department’s special envoy for closing the guantanamo detention center, and paul lewis, his pentagon counterpart. representative jeff duncan, another south carolina republican, said diyab, charged with forging passports for al qaeda, could pose a threat to the upcoming olympics in rio de janeiro, if he were indeed at large in that country. the committee’s ranking democrat, representative eliot engel, who backs the closure of the detention center in cuba, said it was important to keep the issue in perspective. “under no circumstances, in my opinion, is the obama administration simply opening the gate and releasing dangerous terrorists onto the street,” engel said.   lewis and wolosky said only 5 percent of detainees transferred since obama became president have been confirmed to have returned to the battlefield. the percentage was higher for the over 500 released under president george w. bush. there are currently 79 detainees at guantanamo, of whom 29 are eligible for transfer. wolosky acknowledged diyab had been “difficult” from the time he was transferred to uruguay. according to the times, diyab’s friends and supporters say he is off praying and will re emerge soon. obama has been trying to make good on his 2009 pledge to close the facility. but congress has passed laws making it more difficult to do so, chiefly by barring transfers to u.s. prisons. lawmakers are unlikely to lift those restrictions, especially in an election year. they have proposed even tighter controls on transfers in a fiscal 2017 defense policy bill, one reason obama has threatened a veto. guantanamo opponents say holding prisoners for years without charge or trial goes against fundamental u.s. values and since they are muslims, is a recruiting tool for islamist militants. many republicans insist the prison is an essential tool for handling suspects who threaten the united states. donald trump, the party’s presumptive 2016 presidential nominee, has called for the prison’s expansion.

" the u.s. house of representatives narrowly approved legislation on tuesday that would restrict president barack obama’s ability to lift sanctions under the international nuclear deal with iran, nearly three weeks after a similar vote was canceled. house members voted 246 181 to pass the “iran terror finance transparency act,” almost entirely along party lines, with almost every “yes” vote coming from republicans and democrats overwhelmingly opposed to it.  the legislation is not expected to become law, even though republicans control both the house and senate. even if it were passed by the senate, obama has promised a veto, saying the measure would kill the landmark nuclear agreement. the house narrowly passed the legislation last month, but the vote was voided after nearly a third of the chamber showed up too late to cast their votes. the voided vote took place on jan. 13. on jan. 16, u.s. and iranian authorities announced a complex deal in which iran released four american prisoners just as the international nuclear agreement was implemented. congressional aides said the house vote was voided because the new house speaker, paul ryan, was pushing members to arrive for votes on time, not because of any connection to the prisoner deal. democratic lawmakers noted that the repeated vote was not the only one in the house on tuesday that evoked references to “groundhog day,” the 1993 film in which the character played by the actor bill murray lives the same day over and over again. the iran bill was passed just after house republicans tried and failed to override obama’s veto of legislation to repeal his healthcare law. house republicans have voted more than 60 times to try to repeal the healthcare overhaul, one of the democratic president’s signature domestic policy achievements.

" russia said on wednesday it had critically injured a leader of the tahrir al sham militant group in syria with an air strike on his position that also killed 12 of his field commanders.   russia had targeted abu mohamad al golani in an intelligence led special operation while he was meeting his field commanders, the defence ministry said in a statement. a statement by the militant group on its telegram channel denied the claim and said golani was in  good health and exercising the duties assigned to him completely.   may god help him succeed in his task,  the short statement said. golani and his men were bombed by two russian planes on oct. 3, according to a statement by defence ministry spokesman igor konashenkov. the militant leader, who was the head of the nusra front before it merged with other groups to form tahrir al sham, was badly hurt, the statement said.  as a result of the strike, the nusra front leader, abu mohamad al golani, sustained numerous shrapnel wounds and, having lost an arm, is in a critical condition, according to information from several independent sources,  konashenkov said. nusra front severed ties with al qaeda last year and rebranded to head the hayat tahrir al sham alliance. other militants, along with golani, occupy roles in its high command.   around 50 of golani s bodyguards and 12 nusra front field commanders were killed in the same air strike, konashenkov said. they included a close aide to golani and the head of the militant group s security service. the ministry said the air strike was part of an ongoing operation to destroy militants who had launched an offensive on sept. 18. they surrounded 29 russian military policemen who then had to be broken out in an operation backed by air power.

" the former top u.s. intelligence official rejected president donald trump’s accusation that his predecessor, barack obama, wiretapped him even as the white house on sunday urged congress to investigate trump’s allegation. the new york times reported on sunday that fbi director james comey asked the justice department this weekend to reject trump’s wiretapping claim because it was false and must be corrected, but the department had not done so. the report cited senior u.s. officials. the white house asked congress, controlled by trump’s fellow republicans, to examine whether the obama administration abused its investigative authority during the 2016 u.s. presidential campaign, as part of an ongoing congressional probe into russia’s influence on the election. trump on saturday alleged, without offering supporting evidence, that obama ordered a wiretap of the phones at trump’s campaign headquarters in trump tower in new york. “there was no such wiretap activity mounted against the president elect at the time, or as a candidate or against his campaign,” former director of national intelligence james clapper, who left his post at the end of obama’s term in office in january, said on nbc’s “meet the press.” under u.s. law, a federal court would have to have found probable cause that the target of the surveillance is an “agent of a foreign power” in order to approve a warrant authorizing electronic surveillance of trump tower. asked whether there was such a court order, clapper said, “i can deny it.” democrats accused trump of trying to distract from the rising controversy about possible ties to russia. his administration has come under pressure from fbi and congressional investigations into contacts between members of his campaign team and russian officials. attorney general jeff sessions bowed out last week of any probe into alleged russian meddling in the 2016 election after it emerged he met last year with russia’s ambassador while serving as a trump campaign advisor. sessions maintained he did nothing wrong by failing to disclose the meetings. white house spokesman sean spicer said trump and administration officials would have no further comment on the issue until congress has completed its probe, potentially heading off attempts to get trump to explain his accusations. “reports concerning potentially politically motivated investigations immediately ahead of the 2016 election are very troubling,” spicer said in a statement. u.s. representative devin nunes, republican head of the house of representatives intelligence committee examining possible links between russia and trump’s campaign, said in a statement that any possible surveillance on campaign officials would be part of the probe. trump made the wiretapping accusation in a series of early morning tweets on saturday amid expanding scrutiny of his campaign’s ties to russia. an obama spokesman denied the charge, saying it was “a cardinal rule” that no white house official interfered with independent justice department investigations. the white house offered no evidence on sunday to back up trump’s accusation and did not say it was true. spokeswoman sarah huckabee sanders, appearing on abc’s “this week,” said trump has “made very clear what he believes, and he’s asking that we get down to the bottom of this. let’s get the truth here.” trump, who is spending the weekend at his florida resort, said in his tweets on saturday that the alleged wiretapping took place in his trump tower office and apartment building in new york, but there was “nothing found.” senate democratic leader chuck schumer of new york said trump had either made a false accusation, or a judge had found probable cause to authorize a wiretap. “either way, the president’s in trouble,” schumer said on nbc’s “meet the press,” adding that if trump was spreading misinformation, “it shows this president doesn’t know how to conduct himself.” clapper said “there was no evidence” of collusion between the trump campaign and russia in a january intelligence report concluding russian interference in the 2016 election, but “this could have unfolded or become available in the time since i left government.” trump’s allegations echo charges made in recent days by several conservative news and commentary outlets, all without offering any evidence. trump should immediately turn over any evidence he has to support his allegation, said u.s. senator susan collins, a maine republican who serves on the senate intelligence committee. “what we need to deal with is evidence, not just statements,” she said on cbs’s “face the nation,” adding she also had not seen evidence of collaboration “but we are in the very early stages of our investigation.” trump fired his first national security adviser, michael flynn, in february after revelations that he had discussed u.s. sanctions on russia with the russian ambassador before trump took office. josh earnest, the white house press secretary under obama, said the president did not have the authority to unilaterally order a wiretap of a u.s. citizen. “the president was not giving marching orders to the fbi about how to conduct its investigation,” earnest said on abc’s “this week.” ",0

" green groups on friday slammed u.s. president donald trump for choosing a nominee for white house environmental panel who wrote in an opinion article last year that carbon dioxide is not a pollutant. the white house said on thursday that trump had nominated kathleen hartnett white, who served as texas’s top environmental regulator under the state’s former governor, u.s. energy secretary rick perry, to the white house council on environmental quality. the council sets the administration’s environmental policy goals.  white, now a senior fellow at the texas public policy institute, has questioned the notion that burning fossil fuels is causing harmful increases in global temperatures. in an opinion article  in the austin american statesman newspaper on june 20, 2016, she said natural gas had been “falsely maligned” and should be known as the “gas of life.”  environmental working group president ken cook said on friday that assertion indicated that white would facilitate “the rampant looting of environmental and public health protection policies,” according to a news release. the environmental working group describes itself as “a non profit, non partisan organization dedicated to protecting human health and the environment.” the sierra club environmental group called white “a fossil fuel industry apologist” in a news release on friday.  white did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  “kathleen hartnett white is eminently qualified having served as an environmental regulator and on numerous environmental boards and commissions,” a white house spokeswoman said. “her nomination was cleared by the office of government ethics. we look forward to mrs. white being confirmed.”  an overwhelming majority of scientists think that carbon dioxide emissions from burning fossil fuels is a major contributor to global climate change, triggering sea level rise, droughts and more frequent violent storms. white is not the first person trump has picked to join his administration who rejects that scientific consensus. in march, u.s. environmental protection agency administrator scott pruitt said he did not believe carbon dioxide was a major contributor to global warming.

" the arizona sheriff famous for his tough stance on illegal immigration and keeping jail inmates in tents easily won his republican primary on tuesday. maricopa county sheriff joe arpaio, who is seeking election to a seventh term as the top lawman for the area around phoenix, won about 66 percent of the vote, well ahead of ex police chief and three time opponent dan saban, according to unofficial election results posted online by the county. also on the republican primary ballot were wayne baker, a retired deputy sheriff, and marsha ann hill, an ex sheriff’s volunteer.  arpaio is slated to face democrat paul penzone, who was unopposed in his party’s primary, in the general election. penzone, a former phoenix police officer who is expected to present a tough challenge to arpaio in november, lost to the longtime sheriff in 2012 by six percentage points. arpaio, 84, was expected to win his primary despite a judge’s request that criminal contempt charges be brought against him stemming from a 2007 racial profiling case where he was found to have violated the constitutional rights of latino motorists.     the investigation and possible prosecution was turned over to the u.s. justice department last week. it was not clear when a decision would be made. arpaio, who styles himself as america’s toughest sheriff, said his looming legal battles apparently had no effect on the primary race.  “i think the people understand that they should not believe everything they hear,” arpaio told reuters in a telephone interview. “they support me as they always have and that feels good.”     saban has called on arpaio to resign, saying the sheriff has “soiled his badge” and made himself ineffective as a lawman. saban declined comment on the election results through a spokesman, adding that he would issue a statement on wednesday morning.      arpaio, along with three others, could face incarceration and fines if convicted of any criminal charges. arpaio and his second in command, gerard sheridan, already have been cited and admitted to civil contempt.     the charges center on unlawful traffic stops and detentions by deputies of latino drivers for 18 months after the judge ordered them to cease. opponents also have targeted the profiling lawsuit’s high cost to the county, which will have spent an estimated $54 million on the case by next summer.

" california would become the first u.s. state to require farmers to pay overtime to field workers and fruit pickers under a bill approved by the legislature on monday and sent to democratic governor jerry brown for his approval. the bill, which passed on a mostly party line vote, would phase in overtime pay for farmworkers from 2019 to 2022. small farms that employ 25 or fewer workers would have an additional three years to phase in the pay. if signed into law by brown, california, the largest u.s. agricultural producer, would the first state in the country to require farmers to pay overtime to laborers who work more than eight hours a day or 40 hours a week. the governor has not said if he will sign the measure. the bill is the culmination of decades of lobbying and pressure by the united farmworkers union. the democratic controlled legislature rejected a version of the same bill earlier this year, but supporters amended it to phase in the overtime rules more slowly. opponents said that requiring farmers to pay overtime could damage the state’s agricultural economy, where workers toil up to 60 hours a week during the harvest season but can go for months without pay other times of the year. they predicted that farmers would be forced to cut workers’ hours to just 40 hours a week to avoid having to pay time and a half or double time overtime. supporters, mostly democrats, said the issue was one of fairness to farmworkers, who are among the few u.s. hourly workers not paid overtime. “for me, it is a vote about my conscience,” said democratic assemblyman eduardo garcia. “we will be improving the lives of people.” ",0

" brazil s lower house of congress on tuesday gave initial approval to a bill to reduce the huge array of political parties that have made it hard to govern the country and contributed to corruption. the chamber voted 384 16 for the establishment of a minimum national vote threshold that parties must reach to get public funding and free radio and television time for their election campaigns. the requirement would be 1.5 percent of votes in 2018, rising to 3 percent in 2030.  the constitutional amendment must be approved twice in each chamber of congress by oct. 7 to apply in next year s general elections. the proliferation of parties has forced brazilian governments to forge unwieldy coalitions to stay in power by distributing jobs, influence and pork barrel spending, which critics say has provided fertile ground for graft. small parties facing extinction opposed the vote threshold, which they said would favor larger established parties and hinder renewal of brazil s scandal plagued political class. the amendment also seeks to do away with the loose, ad hoc coalitions that parties often form on an election by election basis, regardless of ideology or platform.  brazil currently has 35 political parties, 28 of which are represented in congress. one of them, the brazilian women s party, has only one federal lawmaker, who is a man. brazil s public funding model has encouraged the founding of new parties, several of them with no clear platforms. there are currently 67 requests to register new parties, according to brazil s top electoral court. a sweeping three year old probe of endemic corruption in brazil has uncovered a web of political bribes and kickbacks implicating dozens of politicians, including president michel temer and a quarter of his cabinet. next week lawmakers will vote on a separate amendment creating a new fund of taxpayer money to finance campaigns. that amendment would also replace a system of party lists to elect congressmen with races in which individual candidates with the most votes would win office.

"pointing to donald trump s recent comments on abortion and controversial appointment of an extremist right favorite to the white house, mayor de blasio on monday urged all americans to continue protesting the president-elect.de blasio, speaking after days of roiling protests against the country s yet-to-be-sworn-in 45th president have sprung up in new york and other cities, said resistance is necessary, especially since trump is likely to lose the popular vote   and therefore doesn t have a mandate to rule.de blasio said,  we need to hold trump accountable for anything he does that encourages hate and division   the more extreme he is, the more people fight back, the more it takes away his power. with bill de blasio making headlines for fanning the flames of racial tension between police and protesters it s worth recalling newsworthy information about the new york city mayor s dark past; that he was an active supporter of a brutal communist regime well known as one of the worst human rights abusers in latin america.judicial watch uncovered and reported the scandalous details last year. de blasio was an active supporter of the communist sandinista regime in nicaragua in the 1980s. he was so enamored with soviet-backed revolutionaries that he traveled to the capital city of the war-torn country, managua, to aid their cause by participating in a relief mission. upon de blasio s return to the united states, he joined the nicaragua solidarity network of greater new york (nsn).-jwthe mayor also said that trump s comments on the campaign trail about stepping up stop and frisk wouldn t happen in new york as long as he s mayor. that s not going to happen on my watch,  the mayor said.  nydn",1
" rivals from the two sides of the european union s migration  dispute will meet in brussels on thursday in a goodwill gesture just as the bloc reopens a bitter feud over hosting refugees. prime minister paolo gentiloni of italy, which has at times been overwhelmed with mass arrivals of african refugees and migrants, will talk to the leaders of poland, hungary, the czech republic and slovakia in brussels before all 28 eu leaders discuss migration over dinner. the four eastern eu states have persistently refused to accept asylum seekers to ease the burden on italy and greece, the other sea gateway to europe, even at the height of arrivals in 2015 when more than a million people reached the bloc. since then on, italy, germany and other wealthy destination countries have called for an obligatory system of moving some of those arriving to other eu states when immigration spikes.  they see it as a matter of european solidarity, which also manifests itself in the generous handouts the richer west provides. but the easterners flatly reject any mandatory quotas on accepting people from the mainly muslim middle east and africa, saying that risks compromising their security after a raft of islamist attacks in europe since late 2015. instead, on thursday the four will offer gentiloni some 35 million euros ($41 mln) for eu backed projects rome has been leading in libya to prevent people from trekking north to europe.  but internally, the eu has been unable to agree on relocation, something one senior eu diplomat likened to  fighting trench warfare  that has badly undermined member states  trust in each other.  right before the eu leaders  summit in brussels this thursday and friday, their chairman, donald tusk, reignited the dispute by coming out out strongly against  divisive  and  ineffective  obligatory quotas. an eu scheme agreed for two years in 2015   despite opposition by slovakia, hungary, romania and the czech republic   to relocate 160,000 people has only seen some 32,000 transfers from italy and greece.  in an unusually public row between the eu s brussels institutions, the bloc s executive arm, which has been a strong proponent of a mandatory and automated relocation, lashed out at tusk.     the executive european commission s migration chief, dimitris avramopoulos, called tusk s intervention  unacceptable  and  anti european .  the disagreement between tusk and the commission translates into divisions between member states, casting doubt on whether they will be able to reach an agreement by their june target date. another senior eu diplomat had only  modest expectations  of the leaders  migration discussion on thursday evening, meaning they were not expected to take any decisions but, at best, make a small step towards unlocking a future agreement.

" trust and satisfaction in philippine leader rodrigo duterte fell to the lowest of his presidency in the third quarter of this year, a survey showed on sunday, although sentiment about his leadership remained positive overall. net satisfaction, used by pollster social weather stations (sws) as a rating of the president s performance, was down 18 points from the second quarter to 48, classified as  good  in the survey of 1,200 filipinos conducted in the last week of september.  duterte s net trust rating, which gauges public sentiment about his personality, was  very good  at 60 points, down from  excellent  75 he achieved in the previous poll. the survey was conducted just a few days after thousands of filipinos rallied to denounce duterte, his anti drug crackdown and what they called an emerging dictatorship. thousands of filipinos have been killed in the crackdown and other sws polls conducted in september indicated doubts about the validity of official accounts of the 3,800 cases where police killed drug suspects. the sws survey did not ask respondents to give a reason for the rating of duterte, who took office in june 2016. duterte s spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the survey results. political analyst ramon casiple, head of the country s institute for political and electoral reform, said it was normal for a president s rating to fall during his time in office, but concern over the high death toll in his signature war on drugs will have weighed on sentiment. activists accuse duterte of inciting police to kill drug dealers and users, which he denies. police reject allegations they are executing suspects and say deaths occurred because victims had violently resisted arrest. casiple said that though the poll still showed duterte had the support of filipinos, he should take it seriously.  this is a real diminution of his popularity and it serves as a wakeup call for him to stop it further going down,  casiple said of the poll.  however, this is still a comfortable figure and far from the threshold of unpopularity.  based on sws methodology for net trust ratings, a score of 70 and above is considered excellent, 50 to 69 is very good, 30 49 good and 10 29 moderate. while his political opponents chide him for his authoritarian style and intolerance of dissent, duterte enjoys a cult like following and support from millions of filipinos, who see him as the best hope for change in a country with rampant crime and a yawning gap between rich and poor.

" donald trump’s endorsement from new jersey governor chris christie opens up a wide network of donors, advisers and prominent elected officials whom the billionaire has not yet been able to attract to his unorthodox bid for the republican presidential nomination. as trump tries to lock up the republican nomination on super tuesday, christie advisers and supporters told reuters in interviews that he could bring much needed financial and strategic backing.  christie’s backing demonstrates that trump will be able to bring establishment politicians into the fold, that he could raise the money necessary for a general election campaign and build a staffing operation that can rival a democratic nominee.      the nod from christie comes at a critical moment. on tuesday, 11 states will vote and if trump is able to win all or most of them, he could pull so far ahead in the competition for delegates that none of his rivals will be able to catch him. in an interview with reuters, christie supporter finn wentworth, a real estate investor and former head of the company that owns the new york yankees, new jersey nets and new jersey devils, said he is now seriously considering backing trump. “i am a long time supporter of governor christie. in that process, i have learned to respect his opinion and his judgment,” wentworth said. “he’s a results oriented person, and frankly i am now looking at donald trump because of governor christie’s endorsement today.” maine governor paul lepage, who had backed christie initially, quickly followed in the new jersey governor’s footsteps and got behind trump   making him the second sitting governor to endorse the new york real estate mogul. maine votes on march 5.  a senior christie aide told reuters he believes staff could move to the trump campaign in the coming weeks, helping the republican front runner in his fledgling efforts to build a circle of advisers who could form the core of his general election campaign should he clinch the nomination. wentworth said part of his decision making process is that he is now convinced it is inevitable that trump will clinch the republican nomination. dale florio, a donor to christie, said he, along with others, has a call scheduled with the new jersey governor later on friday. “if he says, i’d like you guys to support donald trump, i’ll be there for him,” florio said. trump has thus far avoided traditional fundraising. however, more than half of his campaign spending in 2015 was covered by money raised through the sale of his “make america great again” hats and t shirts, even though he told his supporters not to write donation checks. but as a nominee, that position may be impossible to stick to, especially if clinton is the democratic nominee and she is able to build a sizable arsenal. christie’s endorsement could have the power to bring more establishment aligned officials and donors into trump’s camp. christie could also serve as a surrogate fundraiser. christie is no stranger to the nation’s top republican donors. in 2014, he served as the head of the republican governors association, a role that largely consists of traveling the nation and raising money for republican gubernatorial candidates. christie was one of the most successful heads the organization has ever seen. rob gray, a republican strategist who had been advising jeb bush, the former florida governor who dropped out of the race last saturday, called the endorsement a “stunning surprise.”  “christie’s endorsement is an indicator to me trump is starting to mainstream his candidacy and that he’ll be able to attract a lot of mainstream experienced political leaders’ support if he gets the nomination,” gray said. “i wasn’t as sure before this.” the biggest boost christie may have offered trump was a distraction from the coverage of marco rubio’s thursday night debate performance and increased scrutiny in some of his business endeavors, like trump university, a defunct venture that offered real estate investing seminars and which is currently the target of lawsuits. both rubio and ted cruz, trump’s two biggest challengers, battered away at trump in thursday’s televised debate   the last before super tuesday. “i’m sure rubio and cruz at the very least had things that they wanted to do today to follow up from their narrative last night and this kind of sucked the air out,” said tom rath, who is advising the campaign of ohio governor john kasich.

" u.s. president donald trump’s lawyers told a new york state judge on tuesday that under the u.s. constitution she had no jurisdiction over the president and therefore urged her to dismiss a defamation lawsuit by a woman who has accused trump of sexual harassment. the lawsuit by summer zervos, a former contestant on trump’s reality show “the apprentice,” contends that trump’s denials of her accusations amounted to false and defamatory statements. being “branded a liar” by trump, the lawsuit said, has harmed her and her business.  trump’s lawyers, led by marc kasowitz, said the constitution’s supremacy clause prevented the judge from letting zervos’s lawsuit proceed in a state court.  the hour long hearing was held in new york state supreme court in manhattan, where zervos’s lawyers responded that there was no legal precedent preventing a state court from ruling on the conduct of a president outside his official duties.  “the motion today has nothing to do with putting anyone above the law,” kasowitz told justice jennifer schecter. under the supremacy clause, he said, “a state court may not exercise jurisdiction over the president of the united states while he or she is in office.” schecter occasionally stopped kasowitz to ask him to clarify his views on her jurisdiction. she asked him if it mattered that she would not be directing the president in his official duties, only potentially ruling on whether his comments as a candidate defamed zervos. kasowitz said it made no difference.  “what that means is the president being haled into court, and once the president is haled into court there are innumerable obligations that flow from that,” he said, saying this would amount to inappropriate “control” over the president. mariann wang, the lead lawyer for zervos, argued, “there is no case that holds that a federal official cannot be held to account in a state court.”  trump’s lawyers did not dispute this.  wang acknowledged that the president holds a unique position but noted that even the president has downtime. they could, for example, meet trump during one of his weekend visits to his mar a lago resort in florida to record a video deposition, she suggested. the judge said she would rule later. trump’s lawyers have said in court filings that zervos is making false, self contradictory and politically motivated accusations and that the president’s remarks were “non actionable fiery rhetoric.” zervos has accused trump of groping her during meetings in 2007. she filed her lawsuit in january, three days before trump’s inauguration. in march, she subpoenaed trump’s presidential campaign for any documents concerning similar allegations against him.  trump has said accusations by zervos and other women who last year accused him of sexual harassment are false. if the case went ahead, it could lead to trump being compelled to hand over any documents from his campaign related to any accusations of sexual impropriety made against him.  zervos’s lawyers, including gloria allred, have cited the u.s. supreme court’s ruling in clinton v. jones, which allowed former arkansas state employee paula jones’ sexual harassment lawsuit against bill clinton to proceed in 1997 while he was still u.s. president.  the decision led to clinton’s impeachment after he lied under oath about his sexual relationship with another woman, monica lewinsky. trump’s lawyers have said that clinton v. jones only applies to lawsuits in federal courts, not state courts. zervos met trump after becoming a contestant on nbc’s “the apprentice” in 2005. she has accused trump of kissing her against her will at his new york office in 2007 and later groping her in a hotel in beverley hills after she met with him about a possible job. she was one of several women who made accusations against trump after the emergence last year of a conversation caught on an open microphone in 2005 in which he spoke in vulgar terms about trying to have sex with women. trump has said the comments amounted to “locker room banter,” and his campaign issued a statement in which he apologized if anyone was offended. since the lawsuit was filed, numerous accusations of sexual misconduct have been made against powerful men in politics, media and entertainment.

" japanese prime minister shinzo abe said on wednesday that countries need to unite to enforce sanctions and apply pressure on north korea to abandon its nuclear and missile programs.  now is not the time for dialogue. now is the time to apply pressure,  abe told a gathering of investors at the new york stock exchange, remarks he later reiterated in an address to the annual united nations general assembly.  on tuesday, u.s. president donald trump warned north korea in his speech to the u.n. that the united states would  totally destroy  the country if threatened. in contrast, japan s asian rival china, and russia, have called repeatedly for a return to international diplomacy and talks with north korea to resolve the crisis over pyongyang s weapons programs.  we can t be satisfied that the u.n. has approved new sanctions against north korea,  abe said.  what s crucial now is to put sanctions into effect without lapses and that requires close cooperation with china and russia.  in his u.n. speech, abe said north korean nuclear weapons either already were, or were on the verge of becoming, hydrogen bombs, presenting an unprecedented threat.  it is indisputably a matter of urgency,  abe said.  we must prevent the goods, funds, people, and technology necessary for nuclear and missile development from heading to north korea,  he said.  whether or not we can put an end to the provocations by north korea is dependent upon the solidarity of the international community. there is not much time left.  abe said japan, a treaty ally of the united states, consistently supported the u.s. stance that  all options are on the table  in dealing with north korea. on sept. 11, the u.n. security council unanimously stepped up sanctions against north korea over its sixth and most powerful nuclear test, imposing a ban on the isolated nation s textile exports and capping imports of crude oil. north korea fired a missile on friday that flew over hokkaido in northern japan and landed far out into the pacific ocean, according to japanese and south korean officials, further ratcheting up tensions in the region. abe said diplomatic attempts to get north korea to abandon its nuclear aspirations have failed over two decades.  dialogue for the purpose of having dialogue is meaningless,  abe said at the new york stock exchange.

" italy s highest court on friday upheld a four year jail sentence on the former chairman of generali cesare geronzi for his role in the 2003 bankruptcy of food company cirio. the decision, by the rome based court of cassation, is final and cannot be appealed. however, three of the four years will be wiped out under a national amnesty and geronzi, a symbol of old style italian capitalism, will not actually serve any jail time because of his age, 82. in april 2015 an appeals court had handed geronzi a four  year prison sentence for bankruptcy, confirming the previous sentence in a long court battle that started in 2003.  geronzi s lawyers over the years have argued that he had no specific powers over cirio at the time of its bankruptcy, when he was at the helm of lender capitalia, and that he had acted correctly. the rome court of cassation also ordered on friday a new trial for cirio s ex chief, sergio cragnotti, who was handed a sentence of eight years and eight months in 2015.

" yemen s ex president ali abdullah saleh appears to have patched up a violent rift with his allies in the armed houthi movement, but the drama has left friends and foe alike wondering anew at the wily political survivor s next move. forming a surprise alliance with the houthis when they seized the capital sanaa in 2014, saleh s army loyalists and houthi fighters have together weathered thousands of air strikes by a saudi led military coalition in 2 1/2 years of war. fearing the houthis are a proxy for their arch foe iran, the mostly gulf arab alliance seeks to help the internationally recognized government push up from a base in yemen s south toward sanaa. saleh s guile has been key to resisting the push. for 34 years saleh ruled over one of the world s most heavily armed and tribal societies with expertly balanced doses of largesse and force. he battled the houthis for a decade in office before he befriended them when out of power. cornered by pro democracy  arab spring  protests, saleh wore a cryptic smile when signing his resignation in a televised ceremony in 2012. then as now, few could discern his intentions. but his desire to preserve by any means necessary his influence and that of his family   many of whom occupy top military positions   seems beyond doubt. his influence has outlived that of other arab leaders left dead or deposed by uprisings and civil wars since 2011. as the conflict has wrought a humanitarian crisis, weeks of mutual sniping about responsibility for economic woes in northern yemeni lands that they together rule peaked with a deadly gun battle between houthi and saleh supporters last week. leaders from saleh s former ruling party and the houthis met and pronounced the split healed. though they pledged to focus on the war effort against yemen s internationally recognized government that is backed by the saudi led coalition, the tensions suggest saleh is seeking to stake out his own political strategy as exhaustion sets in on all sides.   saleh wants to capitalize on popular opposition to both the houthis and the government, positioning himself as an alternative,  said adam baron, a yemen expert at the european council on foreign relations (ecfr). the war has killed at least 10,000 people, displaced 2 million from their homes, led to widespread hunger and a cholera epidemic which has left 2,000 people dead. militias and yemen s powerful al qaeda branch have gained ground in the chaos. any total breakdown within the alliance between saleh and the houthis would be bloody and pit scores of local leaders, tribesmen and army units cultivated by saleh for decades against others loyal to the fighters. saleh appeared eager to avoid that showdown in an interview which aired on monday on yemen today, a tv channel he owns.  there is no crisis or disagreement at all except in the imaginations of trouble makers and sowers of discord at home and abroad,  he said. but the ex leader, at times referring to himself in the third person, said that  imbalances  remained in the alliance, suggesting not all wounds had been salved. analysts say he remains annoyed at the continued existence of a houthi  revolutionary committee  which ruled alone before its alliance was formalized with saleh s general people s congress party in a  governing council  where they shared power.  anxiety also flares over appointments of local officials and control over financial policy   both former gpc prerogatives. beyond local squabbles, the good relations saleh enjoyed with saudi arabia and the united arab emirates during his presidency raise houthi fears of a grand double cross. saleh s son, ahmed ali, lives under house arrest in the uae where he once served as ambassador before it joined its ally saudi arabia to make war on the houthi saleh alliance. a powerful former military chief whom his father appeared to be grooming to succeed him, ahmed ali and the passing of saleh power to the next generation may figure into his calculus.  he certainly wants to secure a place for his family in any post war order ... the houthis are very paranoid that saleh may cut a deal with saudi arabia and the uae that will leave them out to dry,  baron of ecfr added. saleh has denied seeking to advance his son s political career or any backroom dealing with their enemies. to salvage their alliance, the houthis will need to convince saleh that despite their violent history, they make for stronger allies than some gpc members   like saleh s successor, president abd rabbu mansour hadi   who turned on him in the past.  i say to president saleh, out of sincerity and love, beware of these snakes,  houthi official hamid rizq wrote on his facebook page on tuesday.  they are the ones who pushed you to fight wars against the honorable and loyal people in your society then abandoned you and called you are a thief and a criminal.

" britain will not offer a figure or a formula for how much it believes it owes the european union, brexit minister david davis said on sunday, after the eu demanded that london spell out its approach to the final bill to unblock talks. with no movement in the negotiations to unravel more than 40 years of union, britain may miss a december deadline to move the talks to a discussion of future trade ties, which businesses say is vital for them to make investment decisions. both sides are frustrated by the lack of progress, and last week the eu negotiator, michel barnier, said britain had two weeks to spell out how far it would  honour its obligations  to break the deadlock. but davis told sky news the eu had agreed britain would not need to offer  a number or a formula  for the financial deal when london accepted the bloc s schedule for the talks   first a discussion about the divorce and second, about future ties.  in every negotiation, each side tries to control the timetable. the real deadline on this is, of course, december,  davis said, referring to the next eu summit, taking place in brussels on dec. 14 15, when britain hopes the bloc will launch the next phase of the talks.  (british taxpayers) would not want me to just come along and just give away billions of pounds. so we ve been very, very careful, and it s taking time and we will take our time to get to the right answer.     prime minister theresa may says she cannot offer a figure for the financial settlement until her government knows what the future relationship will be. but she also does not want to inflame brexit campaigners who have suggested britain walk away. james dyson, the billionaire inventor of the bagless vacuum cleaner and a brexit supporter, said he did not blame the government for the lack of progress.  the problem is with the people we are negotiating with. i think that demanding billions and billions to leave is quite outrageous, and demanding it before we ve negotiated anything is outrageous,  dyson told the bbc.  so i would walk away.  the so called brexit bill is not the only difficult hurdle in the talks so far. the two sides must also reach agreement on the uk border with eu member ireland   something that irish officials say is still a long way off. irish prime minister leo varadkar said he would not threaten to use a veto on the brexit talks  at this stage , but dublin has called on london to go beyond its promise that a  hard  border between ireland and northern ireland will not return. both britain and the eu say they are ready for a  no deal    a message reiterated by the bloc s barnier in the french weekly journal du dimanche, where he also called on britain to detail which financial commitments it would honor.  theresa may has committed to paying the contributions of 2019 and 2020, as well as other commitments, without specifying which ones,  barnier told journal du dimanche.  the european taxpayer should not pay the price of a decision made ... by the united kingdom.

" in a new twist to his immigration proposals, u.s. republican presidential nominee donald trump held out the possibility of legal status for millions of illegal immigrants, but only after many other border enforcement steps are taken. trump, in remarks to a small group of reporters whom he invited on his plane for the first time since accepting his party’s nomination, said parts of his hardline immigration speech last week in phoenix had been misinterpreted and that he had in fact softened his position to some extent. the new york businessman said that before considering how to deal with millions of illegal immigrants who are obeying u.s. laws and contributing to american society, he first wants to evict criminal elements like drug smugglers and build a border wall. any illegal immigrants who want to gain citizenship will have to first return to their home countries first and get in line behind legal applicants, he said. but for those who stay behind, trump said their cases would be considered at some undefined point. asked about a potential legal status for this group, trump did not rule it out. “we’re going to make that decision into the future. that decision will be made,” he said. “the first thing will be to get the bad elements out, the gang members, get ‘em all out. we secure the border. we stop the drugs from coming in, because the drugs are pouring in ... we’re going to build the wall. we need the wall to stop the drugs.” such a piecemeal approach has been pushed by republican congressional leaders over the years because it is extremely hard to get a comprehensive immigration reform bill through the u.s. congress. trump has struggled to strike the right tone on how he would take on illegal immigration if elected on nov. 8. after flirting with a softer tone, he stuck to his hardline position in phoenix last week, saying that anyone in the united states illegally would be subject to deportation. trump, seated with vice presidential running mate mike pence in tan leather seats aboard his private jet, was relaxed for a session with reporters of more than a half hour, clearly feeling better about his campaign after polls showed him closing the gap with democratic rival hillary clinton. talking about his recent effort to appeal to african american voters, trump was asked if it was difficult to attract black voters since he has raised doubts about whether democratic president barack obama was born in the united states. trump waved off the question, saying it was an issue he did not want to get into anymore because reporters would seize on it. in 2011 while under fire from trump, obama produced his long form birth certificate to prove that he was, indeed, born in hawaii. “i don’t talk about it because if i talk about that, your whole thing will be about that,” trump said. “so i don’t talk about it.” he said his focus for the final two months of the campaign will be mostly about how to create jobs for struggling middle class americans.”i’m all about the jobs now,” he said. trump also pledged to participate in all three presidential debates, saying he considered it an important part of being a candidate. he also said he was fine with the moderators announced last week.

" the only son of fugitive former thai prime minister thaksin shinawatra has been formally charged with money laundering, the department of special investigations told reuters on wednesday. panthongtae shinawatra is accused of receiving a 10 million baht ($300,000) check in 2004 related to an earlier corruption case involving 9.9 billion baht ($296 million) of fraudulent loans extended by the state owned krungthai bank when his father was prime minister. the deputy spokesman of the department of special investigation (dsi), woranan srilum, said panthongtae had turned himself in on tuesday but had been released as no arrest warrant for him has been issued. panthongtae could now gather evidence for his case, woranan said, while the dsi must decide whether to take the case to the criminal court. panthongtae was not available for comment. he complained this month of victimization and called for the dropping of the  money laundering investigation. his lawyer declined to comment when contacted by reuters. supporters of the shinawatras say the legal action is the latest bid by authorities in junta ruled thailand to squeeze the shinawatra family out of politics and blunt its influence. beginning in the late 1980s, former policeman thaksin built a telecommunications conglomerate that made him one of thailand s richest and most powerful men. after entering politics, he won landslide election victories, beginning in 2001, with the support of the rural and urban poor who saw him as the first political leader to care for them. but he made powerful enemies, especially in the bangkok based establishment, which saw him and his populist ways as a threat. ousted in a 2006 coup, and later convicted of corruption, which he denies, thaksin has overseen from self exile victory for his party in every election since, most recently in 2011, when his sister, yingluck shinawatra, became prime minister. she was ousted in a 2014 coup. last month, the supreme court sentenced yingluck to five years in jail in absentia for mismanaging a rice subsidy scheme. recently, old cases against thaksin have been revived, including an accusation that he abused power while he was prime minister by ordering the export import bank of thailand to give low interest loans to myanmar in 2006 to further his business interests. in another case, thaksin was accused of graft and negligence in connection with the approval of a lottery scheme in 2003. authorities are also looking to charge him with royal insult and computer crime for an interview he gave to south korean media in 2015. thaksin, in a message he posted on twitter this month, denied any thought of ever offending the  royal institution . watcharapol prasanrajkit, chairman of the national anti corruption commission, denied any bid to target the shinawatras saying the cases just happened to be coming up at this time. how thaksin s political machine performs in an election expected in november 2018 will be keenly watched.

" the u.s. house of representatives gave final approval on wednesday to a sweeping, debt financed tax bill in a midday vote. it now will go to president donald trump to sign into law, although the timing of that was unclear. the senate approved the bill early on wednesday. here are the key parts of the bill, representing the biggest overhaul of the u.s. tax code in more than 30 years. corporate tax rate: cuts corporate income tax rate permanently to 21 percent from 35 percent, as of jan. 1, 2018. pass throughs: creates a 20 percent deduction for the first $315,000 of qualified business income for joint filers of pass through businesses such as partnerships and sole proprietorships. for income above that threshold, the legislation phases in limits, producing an effective marginal tax rate of no more than 29.6 percent.   corporate alternative minimum tax: repeals the 20 percent corporate alternative minimum tax, set up to ensure profitable corporations pay at least some tax. territorial system: exempts u.s. corporations from u.s. taxes on most future foreign profits, ending the present worldwide system of taxing profits of all u.s. based corporations, no matter where they are earned. this would align the u.s. tax code with most other industrialized nations, undercut many offshore tax dodging strategies and deliver to multinationals a goal they have pursued for years.  repatriation: sets a one time mandatory tax of 8 percent on illiquid assets and 15.5 percent on cash and cash equivalents for about $2.6 trillion in u.s. business profits now held overseas. this foreign cash pile was created by a rule making foreign profits tax deferred if they are not brought into the united states, or repatriated. that rule would be rendered obsolete by the territorial system. anti base erosion measures: prevents companies from shifting profits out of the united states to lower tax jurisdictions abroad. sets an alternative minimum tax on payments between u.s. corporations and foreign affiliates, and limits on shifting corporate income through transfers of intangible property, including patents. in combination, these measures with the repatriation and territorial system provisions, represent a dramatic overhaul of the u.s. tax system for multinationals. capital expensing: allows businesses to immediately write off, or expense, the full value of investments in new plant and equipment for five years, then gradually eliminates this 100 percent expensing over five years beginning in year six. also makes changes to permit for more expensing by small businesses. interest deduction limit: caps business deductions for debt interest payments at 30 percent of taxable income, regardless of deductions for depreciation, amortization or depletion.  clean energy: preserves tax credits for producing electricity from wind, biomass, geothermal, solar, municipal waste and hydropower. carried interest: leaves in place “carried interest” loophole for private equity fund managers and some hedge fund managers, despite pledges by republicans including president donald trump to close it. these financiers can now claim a lower capital gains tax rate on much of their income from investments held more than a year. a new rule would extend that holding period to three years, putting the loophole out of reach for some fund managers but preserving its availability for many. brackets: maintains current seven tax brackets, but temporarily changes most income levels and rates for each one. for married couples filing jointly, effective jan. 1, 2018 and ending in 2026, income tax would be: 10 percent up to $19,050, versus 10 percent up to $18,650 under existing law; 12 percent on $19,051 to $77,400, versus 15 percent on$18,651 to $75,900; 22 percent on $77,401 to $165,000, versus 25 percent on $75,901 to $153,100; 24 percent on $165,001 to $315,000, versus 28 percent on $153,101 to $233,350; 32 percent on $315,001 to $400,000, versus 33 percent on $233,351 to $416,700; 35 percent on $400,001 to $600,000, versus 35 percent on $416,701 to $470,700 37 percent above $600,000, versus 39.6 percent above$470,700. for single individuals, effective jan. 1, 2018 and ending in 2026, income tax would be: 10 percent up to $9,525, versus 10 percent up to $9,325 under existing law; 12 percent from $9,526 to $38,700, versus 15 percent on $9,326 to $37,950; 22 percent on $38,701 to $82,500, versus 25 percent on $37,951 to $91,900; 24 percent on $82,501 to $157,500, versus 28 percent on $91,901 to $191,650; 32 percent on $157,501 to $200,000, versus 33 percent on $191,651 to $416,700; 35 percent on $200,001 to $500,000, versus 35 percent on $416,701 to $418,400; 37 percent above $500,000, versus 39.6 percent above $418,400. these brackets would expire after 2025. standard deduction: in a change expected to end itemizing of deductions for millions of americans, the bill for eight years beginning on jan. 1, 2018, would increase the standard deduction   a fixed amount that can be subtracted from adjusted gross income to lower taxable income   to $12,000 from $6,350 for individuals, and to $24,000 from $12,700 for married couples. child tax credit: doubles the child tax credit to $2,000 per dependent child under age 17, with a refundable portion of $1,400. the refundable portion allows families to lower their tax bills to zero and receive a refund for the remaining value. personal exemption: temporarily eliminates the $4,050 individual personal exemption. under present law, taxpayers who earn below certain income caps can subtract this fixed dollar amount from their adjusted gross incomes to lower their taxable incomes. generally, one exemption has been allowed per individual, spouse and child or other dependent. this would take effect jan. 1, 2018, but then the personal exemption would return in 2026.  individual alternative minimum tax: leaves the amt in place but temporarily changes it by raising its exemptions and phase outs. that will mean fewer people will have to pay the tax, while those who still do will take a smaller hit from it. inheritances: raises the exemption for estate and gift taxes to $10 million from $5 million per person and indexes the new exemption level for inflation after 2011. that means even fewer americans would pay the estate tax, but it would stay on the books. mortgages: for residences bought from jan. 1, 2018, through dec. 31, 2025, the bill caps the deduction for mortgage interest at $750,000 in home loan value. after dec. 31, 2025, the cap would revert to $1 million in loan value. suspends the deduction for interest on home equity loans from jan. 1, 2018 until 2026. medical expenses: temporarily expands the deductibility of out of pocket medical expenses through 2019. obamacare mandate: repeals federal fine imposed on americans under obamacare for not obtaining health insurance coverage, a change expected to undermine the 2010 healthcare law. anwr drilling: allows oil drilling in alaska’s arctic national wildlife refuge.

"the gop never ceases to amaze with its consistent insanity. this time the insanity has to do with the water contamination issue in flint, michigan. a michigan republican said that the flint water crisis may be overstated and another said that it s actually a  hoax.  l. brooks patterson, an oakland county executive said that the water crisis had been  vastly overstated. however, blood testing of flint s children has found dangerously high levels of lead after the cash strapped city stopped buying water from detroit and instead drew corrosive water from the flint river beginning in april, 2014. despite the tests, patterson is skeptical. he made the statement after  gop political analyst bill ballenger had opened a debate on the issue during a radio interview.  i think, well, that s the other side,  patterson said.  let s wait and see what the facts show. on the radio show, bill ballenger said that tests on his own blood had found no elevated levels of lead: this has been a vastly overblown crisis, perpetuated by a lot of politicians with an axe to grind and, for that matter, the news media, and some national figures, some political, some entertainers who don t know what they re talking about. i had my blood tested just yesterday, and i have no elevated blood-lead level   it s way down there. the idea that the entire population of flint has been poisoned and that we all have elevated blood-levels because of this is just a total canard. it s just a crock, and for this to be perpetuated as a story is doing a lot of damage to flint as a community. the evidence or lack of evidence cited in ballenger s rant has given patterson reason to doubt whether the children of flint, who don t have any access to fresh drinking water, were contaminated despite the tests that were done. patterson said that ballenger was  adamant that he lives in flint, he drinks the water, he showers in that water.  ballenger even described the water crisis as a  hoax. ballenger s evidence is at best anecdotal. whether he drank flint s water or not, it s children who are much more susceptible to lead poisoning than adults. eden wells, michigan s chief medical executive, said that all children who drank the city s water since april of 2014 have been exposed to high levels of lead. that is at least 8,657 children. the long term effects of elevated blood levels can lead to many health complications: the long-term effects of elevated blood lead levels in children may include slow development, reduced intelligence quotient (iq) scores, learning disabilities, hearing loss, reduced height and hyperactivity. very severe lead exposure (blood lead levels greater than 80  g/dl) can cause coma, convulsions and even death. it boggles the mind that the republicans would rather talk about isis or repealing obamacare, while they dismiss an unfolding tragedy in an american city that s affecting thousands of american kids.feature image via screengrab",1
" suspected members of islamist militant group boko haram took over a town in the restive state of borno in northeast nigeria  on saturday, residents said. the attack comes days after a suicide bomber killed at least 50 people at a mosque in neighbouring adamawa state in one of the deadliest attacks since president muhammadu buhari came to power in 2015 pledging to end the eight year insurgency.  residents said attackers entered magumeri, around 50 km (30 miles) from borno state capital maiduguri, around 7:00 p.m. (1800 gmt). they said the insurgents shot sporadically and threw explosive devices, prompting locals to flee to a forest.   we hurriedly took our families to the bushes before they could get us. almost every resident is hiding here,  said wakil bulama, one of two residents who spoke to reuters by telephone.  a military source who did not want to be identified said magumeri had been attacked but could not confirm whether it had been seized.  boko haram has waged an insurgency in northeastern nigeria since 2009 in its attempt to create an islamic state in the region. the group has killed more than 20,000 and forced around 2 million people to flee their homes.

(think vince foster)klaus eberwein, a former haitian government official who was expected to expose the extent of clinton foundation corruption and malpractice next week, has been found dead in miami. he was 50.eberwein was due to appear next tuesday before the haitian senate ethics and anti-corruption commission where he was widely expected to testify that the clinton foundation misappropriated haiti earthquake donations from international donors.eberwein, who had acknowledged his life was in danger, was a fierce critic of the clinton foundation s activities in the caribbean island, where he served as director general of the government s economic development agency, fonds d assistance  conomique et social, for three years.according to eberwein, a paltry 0.6% of donations granted by international donors to the clinton foundation with the express purpose of directly assisting haitians actually ended up in the hands of haitian organizations. a further 9.6% ended up with the haitian government. the remaining 89.8%   or $5.4 billion   was funneled to non-haitian organizations. the clinton foundation, they are criminals, they are thieves, they are liars, they are a disgrace,  eberwein said at a protest outside the clinton foundation headquarters in manhattan last year.the former director general of haiti, who also served as an advisor to haitian president michel martelly, was also a partner in a popular pizza restaurant in haiti, muncheez, and even has a pizza   the klaus special   named after him.according to the haiti libre newspaper, eberwein was said to be in  good spirits , with plans for the future. his close friends and business partners are shocked by the idea he may have committed suicide. it s really shocking,  said muncheez s owner gilbert bailly.  we grew up together; he was like family.   your news wireamericans were warned about the crooked dealings of the clinton crime family when in september of 2016, former senate president of haiti, bernard sansaricq, shocked a large crowd at a trump campaign event in little haiti, fl. sansaricq stood up during the public event and relayed his account of the clinton s dirty dealings in haiti while he was still in office. to his credit, candidate donald trump allowed sansaricq to speak his mind, and to expose the crimes of the clinton s, who were attempting to scratch and claw their way back into our white house.sansaricq claimed he begged the clinton administration not to invade haiti. his request was followed up with a visit by an anonymous messenger from the white house who encouraged him to  side  with the clinton administration and he would  be the richest man in haiti. he also demanded that hillary clinton  disclose the audit of all money  related to the haiti earthquake crisis, as he claimed they scammed the poorest citizens of haiti out of billions of dollars through the clinton foundation. not even 2% of that money went back to haiti. so mr. trump, we are asking you, begging you, the haitian community will side with you if one day, you ask hillary clinton publicly to disclose the audit of all of the money they have stolen from haiti in 2010 after the earthquake. haiti is a very poor country. haiti needs defenders. you said you would champion our cause. we welcome you sir and we will work with you. ask hillary clinton publicly, during your next debate for an audit of all of the money they have stolen from haiti. go to the 5 minute mark of the video to see sansaricq s comments to candidate trump:",1
" russia’s foreign minister said on friday the leaders of north korea and the united states should tone down their bellicose rhetoric and warned that a collapse of a nuclear deal between iran and world powers would only embolden pyongyang. “the exchange of threats is quite bad, unacceptable,” sergei lavrov told reporters at a news conference.” we have to calm down the hot heads,” lavrov said, adding that he was convinced a russian chinese proposal could still pave the way for a diplomatic solution to the north korea crisis. lavrov added that a collapse of the iran nuclear deal would give north korea little incentive to drop its nuclear program in return for sanctions relief.

" the white house press corps gathered on saturday for its annual black tie dinner, a toned down affair this year after donald trump snubbed the event, becoming the first incumbent u.s. president to bow out in 36 years. without trump, who scheduled a rally instead to mark his 100th day in office, the usually celebrity filled soiree hosted by the white house correspondents’ association took a more sober turn, even as it pulled in top journalists and washington insiders. most of trump’s administration also skipped the event in solidarity with the president, who has repeatedly accused the press of mistreatment. the president used his campaign style gathering to again lambaste the media.  “i could not possibly be more thrilled than to be more than 100 miles away,” he told a crowd in harrisburg, pennsylvania, calling out the new york times, cnn and msnbc by name. in washington, whca president jeff mason defended press freedom even as he acknowledged this year’s dinner had a different feel, saying attempts to undermine the media was dangerous for democracy. “we are not fake news, we are not failing news organizations and we are not the enemy of the american people,” said mason, a reuters correspondent. instead of the typical roasts   presidents of both parties have delivered their own zingers for years   the event returned to its traditional roots of recognizing reporters’ work and handing out student scholarships as famed journalists bob woodward and carl bernstein presented awards. “that’s not donald trump’s style,” nbc news’ andrea mitchell told msnbc, referring to the self deprecating jokes presidents in the past have made despite tensions with the press. instead, the humor fell to headline comedian hasan minhaj. “welcome to the series finale of the white house correspondents’ dinner,” minhaj, who plays a correspondent on comedy central’s “the daily show” program, told the crowd. he also joked about trump, despite organizers’ wishes, saying he did so to honor u.s. constitutional protection of free speech: “only in america can a first generation, indian american muslim kid get on this stage and make fun of the president.” in a video message, actor alec baldwin, who has raised trump’s ire playing him on nbc’s “saturday night live” program also encouraged attendees. few other celebrities graced the red carpet, although some well known washingtonians, such as former secretary of state madeleine albright and republican representative darrell issa of california, appeared.  trump attended in 2011, when then president barack obama made jokes at the expense of the new york real estate developer and reality television show host. in an interview with reuters this week, trump said he decided against attending as president because he felt he had been treated unfairly by the media, adding: “i would come next year, absolutely.” in pennsylvania, trump told supporters the media dinner would be boring but was noncommittal on whether he would go in 2018 or hold another rally. late night television show host samantha bee also hosted a competing event   “not the white house correspondents’ dinner”   that she said would honor journalists, rather than skewer trump.

" republican john neely kennedy, a candidate for the u.s. senate,  won a runoff election in louisiana on saturday against democrat foster campbell in a race that gives the republicans a 52 seat majority in the chamber. campbell told his supporters in the state capital of baton rouge that he had called kennedy to congratulate him on his victory. kennedy, the state treasurer and the favorite going into the runoff, had slightly less than 61 percent of the vote with all 3,904 precincts reporting, according to the state secretary of state’s office. turnout was relatively low. kennedy, who said he will not move to washington d.c. after a campaign spent railing against “insiders,” told supporters “i’d rather drink weed killer than be anywhere else tonight,” a reference to a widely reported campaign quote in which he said he “would rather drink weed killer than support obamacare.” kennedy will fill the seat held by outgoing republican senator david vitter, who is retiring. in conceding, campbell vowed “i’ll never stop fighting for working families, i’ll never stop working for what’s right.” louisiana governor john bel edwards, a democrat, congratulated kennedy on his victory.  “i look forward to working with him to secure additional funding for flood relief, to make long term investments in our infrastructure and to bring louisiana’s federal tax dollars home to help our people,” edwards said in a statement.  with kennedy’s victory, the republicans will have a 52 seat majority in the 100 seat u.s. senate. going into the general election on nov. 8, republicans had a 54 seat majority. kennedy had campaigned on the popularity in his state of president elect donald trump, who easily won louisiana. trump flew to baton rouge for an election eve rally on kennedy’s behalf, and vice president elect mike pence earlier  stumped for kennedy as well. kennedy, 65, was a democrat until he switched party affiliation in the conservative leaning state in 2007.  he had consistently polled well ahead of campbell since placing first in the state’s 24 candidate free for all primary, which included former ku klux klan leader david duke. celebrities including patton oswalt and john leguizamo both actively supported campbell’s losing bid. under louisiana law, all candidates are pitted against each other in the november general election. if no candidate claims a majority, the top two candidates move to a runoff. also on saturday, republicans mike johnson, a state representative, and clay higgins prevailed in congressional runoffs, replacing representatives who made unsuccessful bids for the senate seat won by kennedy.

" the head of the u.s. environmental protection agency said on monday he would sign a proposed rule on tuesday to begin withdrawing from the clean power plan, former president barack obama’s centerpiece regulation to fight climate change. “here’s the president’s message: the war on coal is over,” epa administrator scott pruitt told a gathering in the kentucky coal country town of hazard. green groups criticized monday’s announcement and praised the plan, a collection of emissions standards for u.s. states that the obama administration imposed to reduce pollution from power plants — the largest emitters of greenhouse gases — by 32 percent below 2005 levels by 2030.  “no matter who is in the white house, the epa is legally required to limit dangerous carbon pollution, and the clean power plan is an achievable, affordable way to do that,” said sierra club executive director michael brune. but trade organizations like the national association of manufacturers, which participated in a legal challenge to the plan, praised it. “this regulation was broader than what the law allows,” said nam vice president ross eisenberg. “at the same time, we recognize the need for a policy to address greenhouse gas emissions.”  the effort to undo the plan is part of a broader target of the administration of president donald trump to revive the coal industry and boost domestic fossil fuels production. the epa now says the clean power plan introduced by obama in 2015 was illegal. pruitt said the obama era plan gave the government too much influence in the competition to generate power in the united states.  jim matheson, chief executive of the national rural electric cooperative association, an electric utility group, agreed. he said ending the plan would take pressure off some cash strapped utilities that still relied on coal fired power plants. but he said market forces were already moving utilities away from coal.  total power generation by coal among the nreca’s members fell from 71 percent in 2014 to 62 percent in 2016, matheson said.  the epa has not decided whether it will replace the clean power plan, according to a draft of the proposal seen by reuters on friday, or whether or when it will propose a new rule to regulate emissions from existing power plants. but the agency said it would soon solicit information on a potential replacement.

" a tunisian police officer who was stabbed by a suspected islamist died of his wounds on thursday, and security unions threatened to stage protests if parliament fails to legislate tougher protections for security force personnel. the suspect, named as zied gharbi, was arrested on wednesday after two policemen suffered knife wounds near the parliament. he shouted  allahu akbar    god is greatest   as he stabbed the policeman in the neck, witness and officials said. the attack was close to the bardo museum where 21 people, mostly european tourists, were killed in an attack by gunmen in march 2015. tunisia suffered two other major attacks that year, one against tourists at the beach resort of sousse and the other against presidential guards in the capital.  our colleague riadh barrouta died thursday after the terrorist attack in bardo yesterday,  walid hkima, a national security spokesman, said. the attacker was 25 and from ettadamen, one of the largest, poorest suburbs of tunis.  the interior ministry said wednesday s attacker had confessed that  he had adopted takfiri thought three years ago and believes that killing security forces is a form of jihad . takfiri is a term for a hardline sunni muslim who labels followers of other schools of islam unbelievers, often as a justification for fighting them.  zied gharbi has no ties with islamist groups, but he had been influenced by hardline ideology on the internet, officials said.  initial investigations showed that this terrorist does not belong to any terrorist organization, he had not received orders from any group,  hkima said. security unions said in a joint statement on thursday they would give the parliament two weeks to approve a new law strengthening punishments for assaults on security forces. the bill, sent to the parliament two years ago, also aims to give policemen more powers in the face of any possible threat.  if the parliament will not pass the bill in two weeks, we will stop providing personal protection to political party leaders and will hold protests. we will escalate , the statement added. parliament speaker mohamed naceur said on wednesday that the bill should be expedited, but added that a dialogue with civil society should be held to respect human rights and the constitution. local and international organizations including human rights watch have rejected the bill, asked to withdraw it from parliament and said it promotes a culture of impunity. the 2015 attacks severely damaged the economy of the north african country, where tourists visiting its mediterranean coast are a significant source of revenue. since then, security has been boosted and authorities have cracked down on militants, dismantling dozens of cells.

" former liberian warlord prince johnson has endorsed george weah for president before a nov. 7 run off vote between the former soccer star and vice president joseph boakai.  the endorsement should help weah, who won 38.4 percent of the vote in the first round this month, more than anyone else but shy of the 50.1 percent needed to win outright. it also puts pressure on boakai to drum up support from other candidates.  johnson s endorsement of ellen johnson sirleaf in 2011 helped the nobel peace prize winner get re elected, though his influence has waned since then: he won 8 percent of votes this year, versus 11 percent in 2011.   i am humbled to announce ... my full and unflinching support in collaboration with the congress for democratic change party of senator george weah,  prince johnson said at his movement for democracy and reconstruction party headquarters.  the announcement follows two weeks of political wrangling, during which the two frontrunners from october s first round sought to gain support from a field of 18 other candidates.  weah is popular and famous, mainly because of his star performances for italian and french football clubs during the 1990s. but he lacks political experience, and his policies to alleviate widespread poverty and chronic under development are vague, making extra support vital.  this is historic and we welcome that,  said cdc chairman wilson tarpeh. johnson is  reading the writing on the wall. it tells you that the people of liberia are tired of one party  rule.  johnson s attempt at playing kingmaker makes many in liberia uncomfortable, given his role in the civil war that ended in 2003. in 1990, his band of troops took control of parts of the capital monrovia to oust former president samuel doe, and he celebrated as the leader was executed. still, his supporters are loyal and are expected to listen to his call to vote for weah.   johnson s backing will not win the vote alone for weah, but it will certainly boost his prospects, especially as other candidates are also likely to throw their weight behind the opposition leader, sensing his momentum,  said roddy barclay, director at risk advisory firm africa practice.

" facebook inc and alphabet inc’s google have little choice but to rein in internet political ads in the face of growing u.s. government pressure, a panel of advertising consultants and executives said on monday.  speaking at a trade conference, the marketers seized on allegations that russian operatives bought u.s. political ads on facebook as evidence that the sector cannot go on being unregulated.  “i think there will be more scrutiny, and there better be more self regulation. otherwise, i think regulation will be coming,” brent mcgoldrick, a political ad consultant and a republican, said at advertising week new york.  last week, facebook chief executive mark zuckerberg vowed to do more to deter governments from using facebook to manipulate elections in other countries, after the company disclosed $100,000 in russian ad purchases in the months before and after the 2016 u.s. presidential election.  the 3,000 ads included some that highlighted support for democrat hillary clinton among muslim women, as well as others that showed a deep understanding of u.s. social divides, the washington post reported on monday.  facebook shares ended down 4.5 percent on monday, closing at $162.87, as some investors worried the tech sector had become too expensive. zuckerberg has also unveiled sweeping changes to how his company handles political ads, saying it would make them visible to all users regardless of whom the ads target.  andrew capone, senior vice president of ncc media, a cable trade group, joked on monday’s panel that during the 2016 election campaign, “facebook took in over 300 million rubles   i’m sorry, dollars.”  mcgoldrick said on the panel: “if i were facebook and google and everyone else, i would be developing a code of conduct and a set of criteria. they may already exist, but obviously it’s not either robust enough or transparent enough.” google has said it has no evidence on its ad platform of a russian propaganda campaign like the one facebook found. the two silicon valley firms are set to take a combined 63 percent of the u.s. market this year, according to research firm emarketer.  though facebook and google have for years resisted regulation of political ads, congressional investigators and u.s. special counsel robert mueller have helped to change the situation, said jefrey pollock, president of public relations firm global strategy group.  “things change with a subpoena,” pollock, a democrat, said as part of the panel.

" former republican presidential nominee mitt romney is under “active consideration” to serve as u.s. secretary of state along with other candidates, vice president elect mike pence said on “fox news sunday.”  romney, who met president elect donald trump on saturday, was a critic of trump during the campaign. pence said that romney was willing to be considered for the position. trump was “very grateful that governor mitt romney came in. they had a good meeting. it was a warm and a substantive exchange and i know he is under active consideration to be secretary of state... along with some other distinguished americans.”  but democrats were skeptical that romney is an actual contender. representative adam schiff, a california democrat, said on cnn sunday that he would love romney to get the position and he would be a “consummate diplomat.” “but i think it’s a total head fake. i think this is donald trump still being the entertainer, still running a show where he wants to build suspense and he alone knows who the contestant will be the winner. it’s more of a nod to the appearance of bringing people together.”   ",0

" east timor president francisco  lu olo  guterres swore in the remaining members of the new cabinet on tuesday and urged the first minority government since independence to focus on improving living conditions and avoiding political upheaval.  the new administration led by prime minister mari alkatiri   faces pressure to lift flagging oil production in the nation of 1.3 million people, where unemployment and poverty remain rife. alkatiri, who was east timor s first prime minister after independence in 2002, stood down in 2006 following a wave of unrest sparked by the sacking of 600 soldiers. his fretilin party won the most votes in july s election but failed to get an outright majority.    guterres said in a speech at the presidential palace that the country expected good governance without waste.  the improvement of well being in our land isn t achieved with political upheaval. it s achieved with work, with the participation of everyone and with dedication,  said guterres.     dwindling output from existing oil and gas fields, compounded by weaker commodities prices, have hit the government s budget and crimped its ambition to develop manufacturing as an engine for economic growth. the former portuguese colony was invaded by neighboring indonesia in 1975. an often violent 24 year resistance movement took east timor to independence in 2002 and many of its key figures still feature prominently in running the country. alkatiri, who is a muslim in the predominantly roman catholic nation, spent several decades living in exile in mozambique during east timor s struggle for independence. nobel peace prize winner and former prime minister and president, jose ramos horta, was also sworn into the cabinet last month in a new post as minister of state and counsellor for national security. hernani filomena coelho da silva has been appointed to the important post of oil minister. he was foreign minister in the previous administration. australia and east timor reached a breakthrough agreement last month on a maritime border, ending a decade old row that has stalled a $40 billion offshore gas project. the dispute has led the owners of the greater sunrise fields   woodside petroleum, conocophillips, royal dutch shell and japan s osaka gas   to shelve the project. fretilin, which won 23 seats in the election, will join with the democratic party to control 30 seats in the 65 seat parliament.  fretilin, or the revolutionary front for an independent east timor, had been in a de facto coalition since 2015 with the national congress for timorese reconstruction, a party founded by former independence fighter xanana gusmao.

" for an estimated 300,000 rohingya muslims living in squalor in pakistan s largest city, the news from myanmar in the past two weeks is reviving  painful memories of the violence that drove many of them here half a century ago.  some say they have got word of relatives being killed in myanmar s rakhine state or are not being able to contact family members.  karachi s rohingya community comprises migrants from an earlier era of displacement dating back to the 1960s and  70s. despite decades in a foreign land, they have stayed in touch with family back home, especially in recent years through mobile phones and social media.  in the past two weeks, nearly 300,000 rohingya have fled to bangladesh after the myanmar military launched an offensive in response to a series of attacks by rohingya insurgents on police posts and an army base. hundreds of homes in rohingya villages have been burned and about 400 people have been killed.  the older members of karachi s rohingya community fled from a repressive military regime that took power in 1962, escaping on foot or by boat to bangladesh, which was then east pakistan. eventually, they made their way to karachi. most of the people living in the slum called arakanabad were born in pakistan, or fled violence in their homeland decades ago. it s named for arakan, which was what rakhine used to be called. raheela sadiq, a more recent migrant who came to pakistan 15 years ago, said she has been unable to contact relatives in rakhine via mobile phone for nearly two weeks.   i have seen what is happening to people over there on the internet,  she said as tears filled her eyes. videos and pictures depicting violence in rakhine and shared on social media are passed around quickly in arakanabad, adding to fears and anxiety about relatives back home.  fisherman noor mohammed, 50, said three members of his  family in rakhine were killed a few days ago.   my brother, brother in law, and nephew were there (in rakhine). they are all dead now. the army over there killed them,  he said, adding that he heard the news from another nephew who is still alive.   hoor bahar, 60, said she left rakhine with her husband over 30 years ago when her mother and sister were killed.   i have one sister left who went to bangladesh seven to 10 days ago,  she added. however, she said, her sister is being held on a beach by boatmen who brought her from rakhine and are demanding $350 as payment. arakanabad smells of fish. the rohingya who live here largely work on fishing boats, or clean the catch brought by fishermen who set sail from the nearby korangi creek.  most of them say they are not able to obtain pakistani identity cards, essential for opening bank accounts, enrolling children in schools, using public hospitals, and even getting a job.  fishing boats, where identity cards are not asked for, are one of the few employment options left although fishermen can sometimes be asked for identification by coast guards.   there is no policy in pakistan for the rohingya,  said noor hussain, the pakistan head of the rohingya solidarity organization, pointing out that the without state issued identity cards the community cannot progress. thousands of rohingya families are crammed into the one room cement brick houses that line the narrow streets of arakanabad.  children play amidst knee high garbage, and crowd around to share slices of jello topped with sugar, or other sweetmeats sold by hawkers.   the community is living in extremely difficult circumstances, and our youth is being destroyed because they cannot get an education,  said hussain. despite the poverty, the community raised around 1.5 million rupees ($15,000) over the eid al adha holidays earlier this month to help refugees fleeing rakhine.   our community is not a burden on pakistan,  hussain said.   the government of pakistan is making millions of dollars by exporting the fish our people catch,  he said, adding that  giving citizenship rights to the rohingya would only benefit the country.

" mexican president enrique pena nieto, who has proposed liberalizing his country’s drug laws, privately raised with california lawmakers visiting mexico a state measure to legalize recreational marijuana, a state legislator said on thursday. a delegation of california democratic lawmakers visiting mexico talked for an hour on wednesday with pena nieto about trade and the state’s border with mexico. during the meeting, pena nieto brought up the november ballot measure without getting into details, california state senator ben allen said in an interview. “but they’re clearly paying close attention,” he added. if california votes to create a legal cannabis market, it would place great pressure on mexico, which is mired in combating its vast drug trafficking networks, to follow suit.  there was no mention of the california marijuana initiative in the presidency’s report on the meeting, and pena nieto’s office did not immediately respond to request for comment. pena nieto has said the united states and mexico should not pursue diverging policies on marijuana legislation and in april proposed a bill to allow mexicans to carry up to an ounce of marijuana has stalled in congress. california’s proposal would allow people over 21 years to possess up to an ounce of marijuana for private use and establish a system to license, regulate and tax sales of cannabis.  recent polls show a majority of californians favor legalizing marijuana. four u.s. states plus the district of columbia already allow recreational use for adults. voters in several more states, including the southern border state of arizona, will consider similar legislation in november. long regarded as a conservative on drug policy, pena nieto has modified his stance since he took office in 2012, reflecting growing latin american disenchantment with the war on drugs. a bill to legalize medical marijuana remains in congress.  ethan nadelmann, the executive director of the drug policy alliance, said he eventually expects mexico to be swayed by the fiscal opportunities of regulated cannabis, which he believes could earn california around $1 billion a year in tax revenue.

" u.s. attorney general jeff sessions on thursday released a government form dealing with contacts he has had with foreign nationals, including russian government officials, but much of it was redacted. form sf 86, required for government employees working in national security, indicated sessions has had no immediate contact with any foreign government or its representatives in the past seven years. however, sessions has said he met with russian ambassador sergey kislyak in the run up to the 2016 u.s. presidential election. a large portion of the document was left blank. “as a united states senator, the attorney general met hundreds, if not thousands, of foreign dignitaries and their staff. in filling out the sf 86 form, the attorney general’s staff consulted with those familiar with the process, as well as the fbi investigator handling the background check, and was instructed not to list meetings with foreign dignitaries and their staff connected with his senate activities,” said justice department spokesman ian prior. sessions released the form in response to a lawsuit filed by american oversight, a group that advocates for government transparency and sued doj in april after the extent of sessions’ contact with the russian government was called into question.  austin evers, executive director of american oversight, said the form was evidence that sessions lied to the fbi investigators overseeing his security clearance. “jeff sessions is our nation’s top law enforcement officer, and it is shocking one of his first acts after being named attorney general was to lie to the fbi on an issue of national security,” evers said.  sessions recused himself from the federal investigation into russian meddling in the election after media reports revealed he held undisclosed meetings with kislyak. sessions admitted to having the interactions, but said they were held in his capacity as a u.s. senator, a position he occupied for 20 years before becoming attorney general.  former fbi director james comey, whom trump fired in may, testified that his agency had information on sessions that would lead them to believe his continued involvement in the federal probe would be “problematic.” it was later reported that sessions had another undisclosed interaction with kislyak at the mayflower hotel in washington in april 2016. sessions told the senate intelligence committee that he had no recollection of the interaction.  special counsel robert mueller, a former director of the federal bureau of investigation is now leading the investigation into russian meddling in the election.  read the full document tmsnrt.rs/2uev9ct ",0

" britain said on thursday that moves toward paying half a billion dollars to iran for a debt owed since the 1979 islamic revolution had nothing to do with a bid to secure the release of a jailed iranian british aid worker. nazanin zaghari ratcliffe, a project manager with the thomson reuters foundation, was detained in april and sentenced to five years after an iranian court convicted her of plotting to overthrow the clerical establishment. she denies the charges. prime minister theresa may s government is under intense pressure to secure zaghari ratcliffe s release, in part because foreign secretary boris johnson made remarks that iran said justified her conviction. britain has sought legal advice over whether it could transfer over 400 million pounds ($528 million) which it owes the islamic republic in capital and interest for a 1970s arms deal with the then shah of iran, the telegraph newspaper. britain owes the money after the shah paid up front for 1,750 chieftain tanks and other vehicles, almost none of which were eventually delivered after the islamic revolution of 1979 toppled the u.s. backed leader. british officials did not directly answer requests for comment on whether they were preparing to pay the money to iran, but may s spokesman said the debt issue was not linked to the attempts to convince tehran to release zaghari ratcliffe. talks to resolve the debt matter have been going on for years.  it is wrong to link a completely separate debt issue with any other aspect of our bilateral relationship with iran,  a government spokesman said, adding that iran s defence ministry remains subject to european union sanctions.  the debt was paid to a bank account controlled by the high court in 2002 but has not been released due to sanctions on the islamic republic, the spokesman said. iran rejected media reports associating the debt britain owed to iran with the fate of zaghari ratcliffe.  these are two separate matters ... linking them is wrong. nazanin zaghari ratcliffe has been tried and sentenced to jail,  tv quoted foreign ministry spokesman bahram qasemi as saying. british officials told the telegraph that work on how to pay the debt has intensified in recent months in a bid to improve relations with iran. when asked about the reports, may s spokesman said the government saw no connection between the debt and the fate of zaghari ratcliffe.  we are clear we don t see any link between these two issues,  the spokesman said.  the reports are speculation, not anything that i recognize.   the thomson reuters foundation is a charity organization that is independent of thomson reuters. it operates independently of reuters news.

" arabs denounced president donald trump s plan to move the u.s. embassy in israel to jerusalem as a slap in the face but few thought their governments would do much in response. trump phoned allies in the middle east late on tuesday to tell them the united states would acknowledge jerusalem as the capital of israel on wednesday and prepare to move its embassy there.  it incites feelings of anger among all muslims and threatens world peace,  said sheikh ahmed al tayeb, imam of egypt s al azhar mosque, one of islam s most important institutions.     the gates of hell will be opened in the west before the east,  he added, warning of the possible reaction.  israel s sovereignty over east jerusalem, which it seized in the 1967 war, is not recognized internationally, and under the u.s. brokered oslo accords of 1993 the city s status was to be decided in negotiations with palestinians.  arab governments issued statements of concern or condemnation and emergency meetings of both the arab league and the organisation of islamic cooperation have been called. but the u.s. decision has been taken.    in a bitterly divided region, backing for palestinians is often seen as a unifying position, but it is also often a source of internal recriminations over the extent of that support.  a cartoon in al arabi al jadeed, a london based arabic news website, showed trump raising a hand against an arab as if to slap him, wearing a large glove marked with the israeli flag.   in lebanon, the daily star newspaper ran a full page photograph of jerusalem on its cover with the headline  no offense mr. president, jerusalem is the capital of palestine .  around the arab world   including egypt and jordan, its only two countries to recognize israel   and across the bitter divide between allies of regional rivals saudi arabia and iran, people denounced the move.   neither i nor my children nor my children s children will give up our right to palestine and jerusalem,  said hilmi aqel, a palestinian refugee born in jordan s al baqaa camp after his family fled the fighting that accompanied israel s creation.    america does what it wants because it s powerful and thinks it won t feel the consequences ... jerusalem is the capital of palestine, not of israel. it never can be,  said nada saeed, 24, a property broker in cairo.   this is a provocation for the arabs,  said mahdi msheikh, 43, a taxi driver in beirut s hamra district.  however, few people reuters interviewed on wednesday expected their governments to take any real action.   what saddens me most about this is that palestine in the past was an ultimate rights cause for us as syrians and arabs ... palestine has retreated from our priorities,  said a lecturer at damascus university, who asked not to be named.       saudi arabia, home to islam s holiest sites, pushed a plan in 2002 offering israel peace with all arab countries in return for a palestinian state including east jerusalem.  but a recent newspaper report suggested it was willing to compromise on several areas that are regarded by palestinians and some other arab countries as red lines. riyadh has denied that and called on trump not to move the embassy.   the current events on the world stage and especially in the gulf help trump take this step because the most important thing is that saudi arabia is not against it,  said adnan, a 52 year old trader in beirut.  the kingdom s top clergy issued a mild statement saying saudi arabia supported jerusalem, but did not explicitly denounce trump s move.  many saudi twitter users posting under the hashtag  jerusalem is the eternal capital of palestine , shared a film clip of the late king faisal, who launched the 1973 arab oil embargo against the west, pledging never to accept israel.  but one twitter user posting with a common saudi family name said that while muslims and arabs would be provoked by the move, its top royals would not be. instead, they would  suppress any move or call to jihad against the zionist enemy , he wrote. in cairo, khaled abdelkhalik, a lawyer, said:  we paraded trump as an ally of the arabs, but he turned out dirtier than his predecessors.   jordan, which agreed peace with israel in 1994 while the peace process with the palestinians still seemed on track, held a special session of parliament.   i call on my colleagues to tear up the treaty of humiliation and shame,  said mp yahya saoud, referring to the peace deal. jordan, like lebanon, is home to hundreds of thousands of palestinian refugees.   this is a conspiracy that is denying us our rights, the first of which is to return. they think we are a branch of thorns that they can step on and break,  said fadia, a social worker with two daughters in lebanon s burj al barajneh palestinian refugee camp.   but we are a bomb. if they step on it, it explodes,  she said.  in israel, analysts said that despite such warnings, they expected little violence or opposition.   the moderate camp in the arab world needs the united states as well as israel in order to face their main threat, which is iran,  said efraim inbar, president of the jerusalem institute for strategic studies.   we may see some public announcements maybe denouncing the american decision, but in substantive terms i don t think much will change.

" u.s. president donald trump and republicans in congress would have a hard time slashing the corporate tax rate to below 26 percent, even if they eliminated nearly every business tax preference, according to a study released on wednesday. the analysis by the tax policy center, a nonpartisan think tank, found republicans might have to expand the federal budget deficit to cut the corporate rate to trump’s proposed 15 percent or to the 23 percent level sought by leading tax policymakers from congress and the administration. the corporate income tax rate is now 35 percent, although many companies pay far less than that thanks to abundant loopholes. “there’s a lower boundary on this and it’s much higher than what the president and congressional republicans say,” said howard gleckman, a senior fellow at the center. “the most likely outcome is that they’re not going to reduce corporate taxes as much as they’d like to,” he said. republicans have vowed to slash business tax rates, saying it would boost economic growth and help create jobs. eliminating tax breaks are a main focus of closed door negotiations on capitol hill and in the white house. but no policymakers have gone as far as the tax policy center did in its study, measuring the impact of throwing out hundreds of tax breaks, including subsidies for research, alternative energy, fossil fuels and domestic manufacturing. “in a revenue neutral bill, congress can’t get the rate below 26 percent even if it eliminates nearly every corporate tax expenditure,” gleckman said in a blog posting accompanying the study.  white house officials and conservatives in congress, including senator ted cruz, have called for deficit funded tax cuts as a way to spur economic growth. but analysts warn that expanding the deficit would undermine economic growth by raising the federal debt burden and forcing interest rates higher. gleckman said policymakers could pay for tax cuts by finding new sources of revenue to compensate for lower rates, rather than expanding the deficit. but republicans have already rejected revenue raising options, including a border adjustment import tax and a carbon tax. the study was funded by the nonprofit peter g. peterson foundation.

" a sales consultant told brazilian prosecutors he believes planemaker embraer sa’s top officials, including chief executive frederico curado, knew of illicit payments related to the sale of military aircraft to the dominican republic, the wall street journal reported. embraer is under investigation by the u.s. and brazilian authorities for allegedly bribing officials in the dominican republic to secure deals for commercial and defense aircraft. according to official summaries of sales consultant elio moti sonnenfeld’s statements, he received a payment of $3.4 million from embraer for work he did not perform, and which he passed along as a bribe to a public official in the dominican republic, the newspaper reported on wednesday.  the journal, citing a person close to the case, reported on thursday that a brazilian judge had dismissed criminal charges against sonnenfeld in february.  the alleged bribery helped embraer secure a $92 million contract in 2008 to sell eight turboprop attack support aircraft to the carribean country. an embraer official, declining to comment directly on sonnenfeld’s reported statements, said wednesday’s journal story was based on allegations that were apparently leaked from confidential testimony in a legal case in brazil, the details of which were not available to the company. the official noted that embraer had stated publicly that it was conducting an internal investigation and cooperating with the u.s. department of justice and the u.s. securities and exchange commission in relation to possible violations of the u.s. foreign corrupt practices act (fcpa). prosecutors in brazil filed a criminal complaint in 2014 against sonnenfeld and eight former embraer vice presidents, directors and managers, charging them with corruption and money laundering. ceo curado has not been named as a defendant and has not been accused of any wrongdoing.

" from cuba to antigua, caribbean islanders began counting the cost of hurricane irma on sunday after the brutal storm left a trail of death, destruction and chaos from which the tourist dependent region could take years to recover. the category 5 storm, which killed at least 28 people across the region, devastated housing, power supplies and communications, leaving some small islands almost cut off from the world. european nations sent military reinforcements to keep order amid looting, while the damage was expected to total billions of dollars. ex pat billionaires and poor islanders alike were forced to take cover as irma tore roofs off buildings, flipped cars and killed livestock, raging from the leeward islands across puerto rico and hispaniola then into cuba before turning on florida. waves of up to 36 feet (11 meters) smashed businesses along the cuban capital havana s sea side drive on sunday morning. further east, high winds whipped varadero, the island s most important tourist resort.  it s a complete disaster and it will take a great deal of work to get varadero back on its feet,  said osmel de armas, 53, an aquatic photographer who works on the beach at the battered resort.  sea front hotels were evacuated in havana and relief workers spent the night rescuing people from homes in the city center as the sea penetrated to historic depths in the flood prone area. u.s president donald trump issued a disaster declaration on sunday for puerto rico, where irma killed at least 3 people and left hundreds of thousands without electricity. trump also expanded federal funds available to the u.s. virgin islands, which suffered extensive damage to homes and infrastructure. further east in the caribbean, battered islands such as st. martin and barbuda were taking stock of the damage as people began emerging from shelters to scenes of devastation. dutch prime minister mark rutte said the death toll on the dutch part of st. martin had doubled to four, and that 70 percent of homes had been damaged or destroyed. following reports of looting, the netherlands said it would increase its military presence on the island to 550 soldiers by monday. rutte said that to ensure order, security forces were authorized to act with a  firm hand . alex martinez, 31, a native of florida who was vacationing on the dutch side of st. martin when irma hit the island in the early hours of wednesday, vividly described how his hotel was gutted by the storm, turning it into a debris strewn tip. doors were torn from hinges, windows shattered, cars lifted off the ground and furniture blown through the rooms after irma hit the building with a burst of pressure that was  like you were getting sucked out of an aeroplane,  he said. martinez, his wife and two others barricaded themselves in their bathroom, pushing with all their might to secure the door as irma battered it with winds of up to 185 mph (300 km/h).  that s when we thought,  that was it ,  he said.  i honestly, swear to god, thought we were going to die at that point in time. everything continued for maybe 20, 30 minutes; my wife s there, she s praying, praying, praying, praying, and things just kinda calmed down. i guess that s when the eye (of the storm came).  staff deserted the hotel to look after their families and martinez and a few others had to scavenge for food and water for three days until they were airlifted out on saturday, he said. dutch authorities are evacuating other tourists and injured people to curacao, where dutch king willem alexander and interior minister ronald plasterk were expected to arrive today. france, which oversees neighboring saint barthelemy and the other half of st martin, said the police presence on the two islands had been boosted to close to 500. the french interior ministry said 11 people suspected of  malicious actions  had been arrested since friday as television footage showed scenes of chaos on the islands, with streets under water, boats and cars tossed into piles and torn rooftops. irma killed at least 10 people on the two islands, the french government said. france s caisse centrale de reassurance, a state owned reinsurance group, estimated the cost of irma at some 1.2 billion euros ($1.44 billion). french president emmanuel macron was due to visit st. martin on tuesday. barbuda, home to some 1,800 inhabitants, faces a reconstruction bill that could total hundreds of millions of dollars, state officials say, after irma steamrolled the island. the prime minister of antigua and barbuda, gaston browne, said irma had wreaked  absolute devastation  on barbuda, which he described as  barely habitable  after 90 percent of cars and buildings had been damaged. the government ordered a total evacuation when a second hurricane, jose, emerged, but a handful of people refused to leave their homes, including  a gentleman (who) said he was living in a cave , said garfield burford, director of news at government owned broadcaster abs tv and radio in antigua and barbuda. irma also plunged the british virgin islands, an offshore business and legal center, into turmoil. yachts were piled on top of each other in the harbor and many houses in the hillside capital of road town on the main island of tortola were badly damaged. both there and in anguilla to the east, residents complained help from the british government was too slow in coming, prompting a defensive response from london.  we weren t late,  defence secretary michael fallon told bbc television on sunday, saying britain had  pre positioned  an aid ship for the caribbean hurricane season and that his government s response  has been as good as anybody else s.  british billionaire entrepreneur richard branson, who sought refuge in the wine cellar of his home on necker island, called irma the  storm of the century  on twitter and urged people to make donations to help rebuild the region.

" the ongoing u.s. canadian trade “irritant” over softwood lumber is expected to be resolved soon, both countries leaders said on thursday regarding the years long fight over pine and other such soft wood. u.s. president barack obama and canadian prime minister justin trudeau, speaking at a joint press conference, said the issue came up at their meeting at the white house but that negotiations were ongoing. “i’m confident that we are on a track towards resolving this irritant in the coming weeks and month,” trudeau said of the trade dispute, which stems from an expired 2006 softwood lumber export agreement. obama added: “this issue of softwood lumber will get resolved in some fashion ... it’s been a longstanding, bipartisan irritant,” although neither side is likely to get everything they are seeking in the final deal.

" papua new guinea began dismantling a shuttered australian run immigration detention center on thursday and warned it will use force if necessary to evict nearly 600 men if they refuse to leave within two days, according to a notice posted at the camp. the asylum seekers have barricaded themselves inside the  manus island center for the past nine days, defying attempts by australia and papua new guinea to close the camp in a standoff the united nations describes as a  looming humanitarian crisis . the men fear violent reprisals from the manus island community if they move from the camp to three transit centers, pending possible resettlement to the united states. the camp was closed on oct. 31 and water and power have been cut off.  you may become very sick under these conditions of overflowing sewerage, heaps of rubbish, no clean running water, no electricity and no food,  papua new guinea s immigration and citizenship service authority said in a two page notice reviewed by reuters.  you are therefore instructed to vacate this compound immediately...if necessary, force may be used to relocate those who refuse to move voluntarily for your own sake.  the men inside the camp, who include asylum seekers from afghanistan, iran, myanmar, pakistan, sri lanka, and syria, said they will continue to defy attempts to shut the camp. they said they had exhausted their food supplies and were relying on rainwater to drink. several of the men told reuters that nearly 100 of them had fallen sick. the notice added that demolition of fences would begin on thursday. behrouz boochani, a kurdish journalist from iran who has been detained on manus island for more than four years, said on twitter that workers had begun that task.  the refugees are watching them fearfully...(they) are extremely scared by immigration threat but still saying we will not leave this prison camp for another prison camp,  he said.  using force against ppl who ve been suffering nearly 5yrs is no solution. if you re going to solve this problem send us to safe third country.  australia has used the manus island center, and another on the tiny pacific island of nauru, to detain asylum seekers who try to reach its shores by boat. it says boat arrivals will never enter australia, even if they are found to be refugees, as this would encourage people smugglers in asia. papua new guinea s high court ruled last year that the manus center, first opened in 2001, was illegal and the camp closed on oct. 31, when australian funded security staff withdrew. thursday s png government notice said the camp will soon revert to the control of the nation s military and anyone there unlawfully will be liable for arrest. papua new guinea prime minister peter o neill on wednesday said  appropriate means  would be used to apprehend those responsible for  disruption . australia s immigration minister peter dutton said on thursday that the situation was  unacceptable...but the government won t be backing down . the png supreme court rejected an application by one of the men to restore services on tuesday, despite pleas from the united nations to make food, water, medical supplies and power available. lawyers for the asylum seekers are due to lodge an appeal against later on thursday.

" the trump administration plans to name a washington based academic and former white house official, victor cha, as the next u.s. ambassador to south korea, an administration official said on tuesday. cha is a former director for asian affairs on the white house national security council and served as deputy head of the u.s. delegation in multilateral talks with north korea over its nuclear program during the administration of president george w. bush. an administration official said he expected the appointment, which will be subject to a senate confirmation hearing, to be announced “soon,” and added that it had “been in the works for a long time.” the move came as president donald trump faced perhaps his biggest foreign policy challenge over north korea’s pursuit of a nuclear tipped missile capable of hitting the united states. cha, a korean american, will replace mark lippert, a political appointee who served in seoul during the obama administration. cha did not respond to a request for comment.   he is currently the korea chair at washington’s center for strategic and international studies and director of asian studies at georgetown university’s department of government and school of foreign service. in a op ed published in the washington post in july, cha called for a new approach to diplomacy towards north korea, arguing that china must be a central part of future negotiations  and should pay for pyongyang to halt and roll back its nuclear and missile programs.  south korea is a long time u.s. treaty ally.

" the european union is determined to go on preventing migrants setting off from the coast of libya, interior ministers said on thursday, despite criticism from rights advocates who say the strategy is aggravating human suffering. after more than two years struggling to stem the flow of refugees and migrants from the middle east and africa, the eu is now showing signs of optimism that it is finally in control. a 2016 deal with turkey effectively closed one major migratory route and this year italy has led the eu s efforts to curb sea crossings from libya, supplying money, equipment and training for libya s border and coast guard, and striking deals with local groups in control on the ground in a country still largely lawless after the 2011 death of muammar gaddafi. mediterranean crossings have dropped from nearly 28,000 people in june to below 10,000 in august, according to u.n. data. sources told reuters late last month a new armed group on libya s coast was stopping migrant boats from leaving.  human rights groups decry the eu s support for libya s prime minister fayez seraj and allied militias who run migrant detention centers they have compared to concentration camps. the top u.n. human rights official said the eu strategy was  very thin on the protection of the human rights of migrants inside libya and on the boats, and silent on the urgent need for alternatives to the arbitrary detention of vulnerable people.     to offset that, the bloc has stepped up financing for the u.n. agencies for migration (iom) and refugees (unhcr) to have them try to improve conditions for migrants inside libya.   we also need to redouble our efforts to provide assistance to the migrants stranded in libya and .... exposed to unacceptable, inhumane treatment and human rights violations,  eu s migration chief, dimitris avramopoulos, told journalists. but the eu is not changing tack on keeping them there.   if we look at the flows of migrants across the mediterranean a few months ago and now, the decrease in illegal migration has been big in numbers,  estonia s interior minister andres anvelt said ahead of talks in brussels with his eu peers.  we ll have a discussion about how to have this success story going on.  avramopoulos said the bloc s executive european commission backed a u.n. call to resettle a further 40,000 refugees from libya, egypt, niger, ethiopia and sudan, an effort to offer legal ways into the eu instead of smuggling or trafficking.  germany s interior minister thomas de maiziere told reporters:  i m happy that the number of people sent across the mediterranean by the smugglers to italy has really fallen in the last two months ... these developments need to be carried on.   we really need to work to ensure that many people simply do not make the trip across the desert to libya. the neighborhood policy with africa is very important for a sustainable decline in migrants coming to italy.  struggling to come up with a plan, the eu has increasingly let libya s former colonial power italy take the lead. interior minister marco minniti has sponsored those efforts, curbing the sea operations of non governmental aid groups and striking deals with libyan mayors to fight people trafficking, among other moves. rome has also played a central role in training the libyan coast guard, which has been accused of abuses, including shooting at aid workers trying to rescue migrants. the eu has denied that any of its funding goes to the militia in the coastal city of sabratha, which has often prevented migrants from departing for europe by locking them up. but a senior eu diplomat said the eu s strategy was complex.  it is hard to know exactly what is going on in libya. we have increasingly entrusted italy with doing the job there, we give them money. there would never be any proof of eu money going directly to some armed group somewhere,  the person said.  some of the methods may seem controversial. but there is also preventing loss of life at the sea and political stability in italy to consider. we shouldn t be too judgmental.

" extending u.s. sanctions on iran for 10 years would breach the iranian nuclear agreement, iran supreme leader ayatollah khamenei said on wednesday, warning that tehran would retaliate if the sanctions are approved.  the u.s. house of representatives re authorized last week the iran sanctions act, or isa, for 10 years. the law was first adopted in 1996 to punish investments in iran’s energy industry and deter iran’s pursuit of nuclear weapons. the iran measure will expire at the end of 2016 if it is not renewed. the house bill must still be passed by the senate and signed by president barack obama to become law. iran and world powers concluded the nuclear agreement, also known as jcpoa, last year. it imposed curbs on iran’s nuclear program in return for easing sanctions that have badly hurt its economy.  “the current u.s. government has breached the nuclear deal in many occasions,” khamenei said, addressing a gathering of members of the revolutionary guards, according to his website.  “the latest is extension of sanctions for 10 years, that if it happens, would surely be against jcpoa, and the islamic republic would definitely react to it.”  the u.s. lawmakers passed the bill one week after republican donald trump was elected u.s. president. republicans in congress unanimously opposed the agreement, along with about two dozen democrats, and trump has also criticized it. lawmakers from both parties said they hoped bipartisan support for a tough line against iran would continue under the new president. president elect trump once said during his campaign that he would “rip up” the agreement, drawing a harsh reaction from khamenei, who said if that happens, iran would “set fire” to the deal. the house of representatives also passed a bill last week that would block the sale of commercial aircraft by boeing (ba.n) and airbus (air.pa) to iran.  the white house believes that the legislation would be a violation of the nuclear pact and has said obama would veto the measure even if it did pass the senate.

" u.s. president donald trump’s administration is preparing to ignore any rulings by the world trade organization that it sees as an affront to u.s. sovereignty, the financial times reported on tuesday, citing a report prepared by officials. the draft document, due to be sent to the u.s. congress on wednesday, marks the first time the new administration has laid out its trade plans in writing, the times said. “ever since the united states won its independence, it has been a basic principle of our country that american citizens are subject only to laws and regulations made by the u.s. government — not rulings made by foreign governments or international bodies,” the report said, according to the times. “accordingly, the trump administration will aggressively defend american sovereignty over matters of trade policy,” the report said, according to the times. the wall street journal, which also said it reviewed the  document, said the policy represents a dramatic departure from the obama administration, which emphasized international economic rules and the authority of the wto, a body that regulates trade and resolves disputes among its members. by contrast, the trump administration will more assertively defend u.s. sovereignty over trade policy, ramp up enforcement of u.s. trade laws, and use “all possible sources of leverage to encourage other countries to open up their markets,” the document said, according to the journal. the white house did not immediately respond to a reuters request for comment.  congress requires the president to submit the administration’s trade policy annually by march 1. in the face of republican concerns, a congressional aide said language in the draft challenging the wto could still be toned down in a final, public version, the journal reported. washington is facing several important wto decisions, particularly involving china. potentially the most important is a wto complaint filed in december by beijing against the eu and the united states for blocking china’s request to be treated as a “market economy” under the institution’s rules. a final ruling could still be years away. but were the u.s. to ignore a finding in china’s favor it could have major consequences for the wto as a venue for resolving trade disputes before they fester into destructive trade wars, the times said.  ",0
" the longest serving member of delaware’s supreme court, randy holland, announced his plan to retire at the end of march, according to a statement from the court on thursday. holland, 70, joined the five member court as the youngest ever to serve in 1986 and became the longest serving member in 2009.  a replacement will be nominated by governor john carney, who took office last month, and must be confirmed by the state’s senate. justices serve 12 year terms. “i just feel that after 30 years it is time to retire,” said holland in a statement. “i’m looking forward to pursuing other opportunities, like teaching.” a majority of publicly traded u.s. companies are chartered in delaware and the court plays a key role interpreting the state’s corporate law and has decided many billion dollar merger disputes. the court recently dismissed a $171 million investor lawsuit against pipeline operator kinder morgan inc and revived a lawsuit against zynga inc’s controlling shareholder, mark pincus, over sales of the social gaming company’s stock. the court is also expected to rule in the coming months on a heated lawsuit that could decide control of one of the world’s largest translation services companies, transperfect global inc. holland was the remaining justice on the court who had been appointed prior to leo strine becoming the court’s chief justice in 2014. strine was elevated from the role of chancellor, or chief judge, of the court of chancery, which specializes in corporate disputes.

" bernie sanders may have lost his bid to become the democratic nominee for the white house, but party members don’t want the u.s. senator from vermont to step off the stage. more than three quarters of democrats say sanders should have a “major role” in shaping the party’s positions, while nearly two thirds say hillary clinton   who beat him for the nomination   should pick him as her vice presidential running mate, according to a reuters/ipsos poll. in a sign that democrats hope their party can unite after a fierce primary season, two thirds also said that sanders should endorse clinton, a former secretary of state and senator who appears bound for a showdown with republican donald trump in november’s presidential election. sanders, a self described democratic socialist, managed to turn his long shot run into a mass movement with hard line proposals to combat wealth inequality, increase access to health care and education, and defend the environment. his challenge to clinton, one of the best known figures in american politics, lasted far longer than expected, as he racked up strong results in a number of state nominating contests and stayed in the race even when the delegate count seemed to spell his doom, and yielded record numbers of small donations to his campaign. sanders so far has not conceded defeat, even though clinton recently clinched the nomination and won endorsements from president barack obama and u.s. senator elizabeth warren of massachusetts   a favorite of the same left leaning voters who supported him. sanders has said he will continue to push for a liberal agenda heading into the democratic national convention in july   when clinton’s nomination is expected to become official   though he has hinted he does not want his presence to hurt the democrats’ chances of keeping the white house.  “we will not let donald trump become president,” sanders told supporters last week. the poll, conducted june 7 10   right after clinton sewed up the delegate majority to become the presumptive democratic nominee   showed that while most democrats want sanders to line up behind clinton, about 44 percent would like him to make an independent run for the white house. some 47 percent said he should not. the poll included 455 respondents and has a credibility interval, a measure of accuracy, of 5.3 percentage points.

" u.s. environmental group the sierra club has asked the environmental protection agency’s inspector general to investigate whether the agency’s head, scott pruitt, violated internal policies when he said he did not believe carbon dioxide was a major contributor to climate change, according to a letter seen by reuters on wednesday. lawyers for the sierra club wrote to the epa’s office of inspector general on tuesday asking the independent watchdog to check whether pruitt violated the epa’s 2012 scientific integrity policy when he told a cnbc interviewer on march 9, “i would not agree that it’s a primary contributor to the global warming that we see.” the request ramps up tension between the u.s. environmental movement and the administration of president donald trump, who has called global warming a hoax meant to weaken the u.s. economy and has packed his cabinet with people who question the science of climate change. an overwhelming majority of scientists think that carbon dioxide emissions from burning fossil fuels is a major contributor to global climate change, triggering sea level rise, droughts and more frequent violent storms. “it’s pretty unprecedented to have the head of the epa contradicting basic scientific facts,” sierra club senior attorney elena saxonhouse told reuters on wednesday. in the letter, the sierra club’s lawyers said pruitt’s comments contradicted a “comprehensive review” of scientific research on climate change and appeared to be politically motivated. the epa website says its policy is meant to maintain “a culture of scientific integrity for all its employees,” and requires epa officials and staff to ensure the agency’s work respects the findings of the broader scientific community. “administrator pruitt’s comments are perfectly in keeping with the scientific integrity policy,” epa spokesman john konkus said in an email. “there is an ongoing scientific debate on climate change, its causes and its effect. that debate should be encouraged as the administrator has done, not discouraged as sierra club is attempting to do.”  a spokeswoman for the epa’s inspector general said in an email the ig’s office could neither confirm nor deny investigation requests.    as oklahoma’s attorney general, pruitt sued the epa more than a dozen times while accepting campaign donations from the energy industry. emails released on feb. 22 by an oklahoma court showed pruitt also used language provided by an energy company in one of his challenges of the epa over methane emissions regulations. sierra club’s saxonhouse said the group believed that the epa’s scientific integrity policy applied to political appointees as well as career epa staff, but said it was unclear how the agency could enforce it. “it shouldn’t just be a piece of paper or some words on a website. it’s intended to protect the public from bad decision making that’s not based on real facts,” she said.

" the u.s. navy has introduced new measures aimed at avoiding a repeat of two deadly crashes in the asia pacific region involving its warships and commercial vessels following a review of its practices, the seventh fleet commander said on monday.     vice admiral phillip sawyer s comments come after a u.s. guided missile destroyer was slightly damaged at the weekend when a japanese tug drifted into it during a towing exercise off central japan, the latest incident in the pacific this year involving ships from the fleet. the u.s. navy announced a series of reforms this month aimed at restoring basic naval skills and alertness at sea after a review of deadly collisions in the asia pacific region showed sailors were under trained and over worked. two of the incidents   collisions with commercial vessels involving guided missile destroyers, the fitzgerald in june off japan and then the john s. mccain in august as it approached singapore   have left a total of 17 sailors dead. the crashes were caused by preventable errors by the sailors on board the ships, navy investigations showed. speaking to reporters on the sidelines of an international fleet review in the thai seaside town of pattaya, sawyer said the navy made  circadian rhythm  sleep guidelines a requirement and a new group, the naval surface group western pacific, has been training officers at the fleet s headquarters in yokosuka, south of tokyo, japan.  this is a team that is now in yokosuka and they re charged with doing the man, train, equip aspect of our operations with surface ships,  sawyer told reporters.  the second thing we have done is automatic identification system and that s a system onboard ships that puts out signal and it tells whoever is receiving that signal the course, speed and identification of the ship,  he said.  the third thing is that we are working on the circadian rhythm onboard the ships  to make the sailors more alert. sawyer took command of the u.s. force in august after the navy removed the fleet s previous commander, vice admiral joseph aucoin, following a series of collisions. the u.s. seventh fleet operates in the largest of the u.s. navy s numbered fleets. it oversees about 70 80 ships and submarines at any given time in the region.  the fleet operates over an area of 124 million square km (48 million square miles) from bases in japan, south korea and singapore.

" u.s. president donald trump s defense secretary plans this week to become the first pentagon chief to travel to mexico for its independence day activities, the defense department said on tuesday, in a sign that defense ties are withstanding political tensions between the two countries. u.s. mexican relations have been strained by trump s threats to curtail trade with latin america s no. 2 economy as well as his demand that mexico pay for a border wall to keep out immigrants and drug traffickers. jim mattis  planned trip on friday would be only the fifth by a u.s. defense secretary to mexico, said pentagon spokesman army lieutenant colonel jamie davis.   secretary mattis  visit to mexico reaffirms our commitment to the bilateral defense relationship and to the north america community,  davis said. although mexico s official independence day is on sept. 16, most celebrations take place on sept. 15. the event commemorates the launch of mexico s war of independence from spain in 1810.  the fact that mattis would be visiting for such an important national event is itself notable.  mexicans have a long memory of the mexican american war of 1846 1848, which led to mexico s loss of almost half its territory to the united states. the war has long made u.s. mexican military cooperation a somewhat sensitive subject in mexico. the visit by mattis also comes amid signs of improving u.s. mexican cooperation in cracking down on the heroin trade. reuters reported in april that mexico s army was allowing the united states and the united nations to observe opium poppy eradication. [nl2n1he07m] the mexican army took u.s. military officials on helicopter tours of half a dozen sites in sinaloa and chihuahua, two of the three states that along with durango make up the golden triangle where most mexican opium is produced, one of the sources said at the time.

" billionaire carlos slim said on friday that mexico should not fear donald trump, seeing opportunities for his country in the u.s. president’s economic policies, and praising mexicans for uniting behind their government in talks with the northern neighbor. in a rare news conference, the telecommunications and construction mogul called trump a negotiator, “not terminator” and said his repeated attacks on mexico had united the country, giving president enrique pena nieto “strength” in trade and border security talks. “this is the most surprising example of national unity that i’ve had the pleasure of seeing in my life,” said slim, who turns 77 on saturday. he compared mexicans’ response to that when a devastating earthquake that hit mexico city in 1985. “we have to back the president of mexico so he defends our national interests.” slim spoke to reporters after pena nieto on thursday canceled a planned washington summit with trump following a tweet by the american that he should stay away unless mexico agreed to pay for a border wall. aiming to cool tensions, the two presidents spoke for an hour by phone on friday, and the battered peso currency strengthened. trump’s threats to impose steep tariffs on mexican products have ravaged the peso and spread worries about the economy, which is heavily dependent on the u.s. market.  however, slim, who spoke out against his fellow billionaire during the u.s. election campaign but had dinner with him after the nov. 8 victory at the polls, said trump’s policies aimed at growing the u.s. economy would boost mexico’s growth as well as provide jobs for mexican laborers living north of the border.     “the circumstances in the united states are very favorable for mexico,” slim said, adding that he has not had any communication with trump’s team since the december dinner. “it wasn’t a romance,” he joked about the meeting. referring repeatedly to trump’s books and other writings, slim argued that people should not be surprised at trump’s actions because it is all in his book “great again: how to fix our crippled america,” which slim said he had not finished reading. “he’s a great negotiator,” slim said. he said businesses should not be too worried if trump’s policies led to the collapse of the north american free trade agreement (nafta) underpinning mexico’s economy, saying the country could fall back on world trade organization tariffs. he said mexican workers in the united states would benefit from trump’s planned infrastructure push, but warned that u.s. protectionism and other policies could hurt american consumers.  “among these changes is a return to the past, what a dear friend called ‘regressive utopias’,” he said, calling on the united states to focus on advanced manufacturing. asked about trump’s plan to build a wall along the u.s. mexico border, slim said the best barrier to illegal immigration would be investment that created opportunities and jobs in mexico. before the highly anticipated news conference, speculation had been growing about whether slim might try to run for president in 2018, but he poured cold water on that talk. “i think i can do more on the business side,” he said. slim’s largest companies do not have much obvious exposure to any border tax trump might impose on mexican imports. his high profile holding in the new york times co, made him a target during the u.s. campaign, when trump accused him of using the newspaper to try to help democratic party candidate hillary clinton. slim’s shares have limited voting rights. slim on friday said he had been selling new york times stock, but his son in law later said this was not correct. at the conference he was flanked by two of his sons, carlos and marco antonio, and his son in law, arturo elias, with other family members watching. most of the slim family’s wealth comes from latin america focused telecoms giant america movil. america movil does have a substantial u.s. business called tracfone which sells prepaid phone plans to customers and rents the networks of big operators. his next largest companies are retail and industrial conglomerate grupo carso and mexico focused bank grupo financiero inbursa.

" philippine president rodrigo duterte said on sunday he would deal with u.s. president donald trump  in the most righteous way  when they meet next month to discuss regional security and manila s war on drugs. trump will travel to asia on nov. 3 14 amid rising tensions over north korea s nuclear and missile programs. he will be in manila on the last leg of his trip, which includes visits to japan, south korea, china, and vietnam, to attend the asean leaders  summit. trump will meet with duterte but will skip the larger meeting in manila with heads of states and governments from china, south korea, japan, india, australia and new zealand.  it would be terrorism, cooperation between the two countries, the fight against drugs. i expect to be dealing with him around these topics,  duterte said in a media briefing before leaving for japan to meet prime minister shinzo abe.  i would deal with president trump in the most righteous way, welcome him as an important leader,  he said.  i would have to also listen to him, what he has to say.   duterte is known for his often profanity laden tirades against the united states, chiding washington for treating the philippines  like a dog,  despite the two nations  longstanding relationship. the philippines  leader announced his  separation  from the united states during a visit to beijing a year ago, declaring he had realigned with china as the two agreed to resolve their south china sea dispute through talks. duterte was infuriated by expressions of concern by members of former president barack obama s administration about extrajudicial killings in the philippines. but trump, in a phone call to duterte in may, praised the philippine leader for doing an  unbelievable job on the drug problem  despite human rights groups  condemnation of duterte s drug crackdown, in which thousands of people have been killed. human rights, rule of law and due process are among  important developments  the two leaders would likely discuss during their bilateral talks, sung kim, u.s. ambassador to manila, told foreign correspondents last week. duterte is accused by international human rights groups of supporting a campaign of extrajudicial killings of drug suspects in the philippines, which his government denies. he defended his 16 month old campaign last week, telling southeast asian lawyers at a gathering in manila that he had been  demonized  and denying allegations of state sponsored killings of drug dealers and users. duterte, speaking in davao city on sunday night, said the situation in the korean peninsula would be the main agenda item in his talks with trump.  we are worried. if anything can go wrong, it will go wrong,  he said.  a nuclear war is totally unacceptable to everybody.  duterte said it would be good if the united states, japan and south korea would sit down and talk to north korean leader kim jong un and  tell him that nobody s threatening him, that there would be no war, and that if you can just tone down or stand down, stop the threats, and that would be the same for america.  duterte previously described kim as a  fool  and  son of a bitch  for  playing with dangerous toys.  duterte said the north korea threats would also be discussed during his meeting with abe, along with tokyo s assistance to rebuild the conflict torn marawi city in southern philippines and for manila s infrastructure projects.

" u.s. republican presidential candidate donald trump has been a hit with small donors, raking in two thirds of his individual campaign contributions in sums of $200 or less, according to financial disclosures filed on tuesday.  but with the big money donor class, the players trump blasted during the primary season as greedy influence peddlers, the celebrity businessman has fallen short of expectations, the disclosures filed with the federal government showed. trump took in 65 percent of his total $75 million in individual campaign contributions from people who pitched in $200 or less, but super pac contributions fell short of expectations.  great america pac, the pro trump super pac led by republican operative ed rollins, said in july it expected to pull in more than $20 million by now. instead, it has raised just $11 million, according to the latest campaign finance disclosures.  in a similar fashion, a pro trump super pac kicked off by los angeles real estate investor tom barrack, rebuilding america now, said in june it had $32 million in fundraising commitments. but it received just over $2 million that month. a spokesperson for the super pac says it has now raised $18 million. it will not file its next report until october 15.   the republican kingmaker who was expected to be trump’s single biggest backer, casino magnate sheldon adelson, has scaled back his initial pledge of $100 million, made in a private meeting with trump in may, to just $5 million, according to two associates close to adelson familiar with the matter. democrat hillary clinton, who will face trump in the nov. 8 election, has received about a quarter of her campaign donations from people who contributed $200 or less   $71 million out of a total of $289 million, according to disclosures.  among the biggest backers to the pro clinton super pac, priorities usa, were donald sussman, president of paloma partners advisors, inc, george soros, chairman of soros fund management, and daniel abraham, executive at sda enterprises. clinton’s money advantage will help her fund ad campaigns and get out the vote efforts in the final stretch the 2016 election. she leads trump by 4 percentage points nationally, according to the latest reuters/ipsos tracking poll. together, clinton’s campaign and super pac have raked in a total of $520 million. by comparison, trump’s campaign and two super pacs backing him have brought in a combined $200 million. super pacs can raise unlimited money for candidates as long as they don’t directly coordinate with the campaign. the latest filings, which cover spending through august 31, showed a big increase in trump’s spending, with $30 million in disbursements, more than any month so far. they also provided further insight into the stark differences between the two candidates’ operations. the clinton campaign’s outlays reflect a traditional presidential playbook, spending five times more than trump’s has on television ads and nine times more on payrolls. the trump campaign has spent $21 million on online advertising and strategy, $11 million on t shirts, trucker hats and yard signs, and $4 million on field consulting.  trump recently scored a promise of a $1 million donation from the ricketts family, which had previously backed a super pac opposing him, but he has yet to see the flurry of large checks that flowed into the coffers of former republican white house rivals such as jeb bush and ted cruz.  instead of plowing money into the trump campaign, adelson    like his fellow top conservative backers, the billionaire industrialist koch brothers   will focus his efforts and donations on senate and house of representatives races, two sources said. tuesday night’s filings show adelson and his physician wife miriam gave $20 million to the senate leadership fund, a republican super pac.  the adelsons plan on giving an additional $20 million to the super pac that backs republican house candidates, the sources said.

" britain is becoming subservient to a united states that will be extremely difficult to cooperate with judging by president donald trump’s “serious and worrying” first acts, french presidential candidate emmanuel macron said on friday. british prime minister theresa may, who will hold talks with trump later on friday, wants a renewal of the “special relationship” between london and washington at a time her conservative government redraws its relationship with europe.  “britain lived in an equilibrium with europe,” macron told france culture radio. “but now it is becoming a vassal state, meaning it is becoming the junior partner of the united state.”  french opinion polls show macron, a former investment banker running as an independent in this spring’s presidential election, closing in on the two frontrunners, conservative candidate francois fillon and far right leader marine le pen. speaking about trump, may joked on thursday that “opposites attract” as she signaled a shift in foreign policy that will bring her position more in line with that of trump.  macron said trump’s early policy moves suggested the united states might become a destabilizing force on the world stage.  “what’s happening today with trump’s first statements and choices is extremely serious and worrying,” macron said. “it’s firstly a choice that it will be an america that provokes... an america that destabilizes things that have been built for decades.” macron has previously said he was sure trump would maintain close ties with the european union, but on friday he appeared to concede this may no longer be the case.  “it signifies that the u.s. will no longer be in a position to co organize globalization and be the world’s policeman with the european union,” the former economy minister said. “the unpredictable choices, the outbursts and the inward looking united states of trump no longer guarantees europe’s security.”    ",0
" former utah governor jon huntsman, president donald trump’s nominee to be ambassador to russia, said on tuesday there was “no question” moscow meddled in the 2016 u.s. election, and pledged to bring up the matter with the russian government. “there is no question, underline no question, that the russian government interfered in the u.s. election last year, huntsman, a former ambassador to china, said at his senate confirmation hearing. “moscow continues to meddle in the democratic processes of our friends and allies,” he said, taking a tough line welcomed by several members of the senate foreign relations committee. many members of congress, including several of trump’s fellow republicans, are concerned the president will not take a hard enough line in dealings with russia to combat russian expansionism in eastern europe or its support for syria’s government in that country’s civil war. despite trump’s objections, lawmakers in late july passed a tough package of sanctions on russia that included barring him from easing them without congressional approval. huntsman said he thought any action on sanctions should be tied to whether russia ends its aggression in ukraine. russia has denied interfering in the election, but u.s. intelligence agencies’ conclusion that it did so to boost trump’s chances of being elected have shadowed his presidency. congressional committees and a special counsel are investigating whether trump associates colluded with russia. the white house has denied any collusion and russia has denied any involvement. huntsman said he would raise the issue with russian authorities. “i will also not hesitate to remind government officials that they are accountable for their actions. exhibit a is the fact that interference in the u.s. election has led directly to the current low level of trust in the relationship,” he said. he also said he would try to work with moscow in areas where the two countries have common interests, such as international efforts to curb north korea’s nuclear weapons and ballistic missile development. huntsman, 57, served as ambassador to beijing under president barack obama, a democrat, and to singapore under former republican president george h.w. bush. the committee will likely vote to support huntsman in the coming weeks, paving the way for what is expected to be an easy confirmation by the full senate. senator chris coons, a democratic committee member, called huntsman “one of the very highest quality nominees for an ambassadorial post i have seen.”  ",0
" china said on friday it had no intention of using currency devaluation to its advantage in trade, responding to u.s. president donald trump’s description of the asian giant as the “grand champions” of currency manipulation. trump said in an interview with reuters on thursday he had not “held back” in his assessment that china manipulates its yuan currency, just hours after his new treasury secretary pledged a more methodical approach to analysing beijing’s foreign exchange practices. chinese foreign ministry spokesman geng shuang said he hoped the united states could “fully and correctly” view the exchange rate issue. “china has no intention of seeking foreign trade advantages via an intentional devaluation of the renminbi. there is no basis for the continued devaluation of the renminbi,” he told a daily media briefing in beijing. “if you must attach the label ‘grand champion’ to china, then i think china is a grand champion. but we are the grand champions of economic development,” geng added. the foreign ministry has no say in currency policy, but it is the only chinese government department that holds a daily briefing that foreign reporters attend. the central people’s bank of china did not respond to a request for comment. in a commentary, the official xinhua news agency said criticising china for manipulating its currency to prop up trade was a “major myth that has been circulating in washington for quite a long time”. “since july 2005, china has decided to unpeg the yuan against the u.s. dollar, and allow it to fluctuate against a basket of currencies so as to better reflect the market changes. over the years, the renminbi has appreciated substantially against the dollar,” it said. trump has frequently accused china of keeping its currency artificially low against the dollar to make chinese exports cheaper, “stealing” american manufacturing jobs. but he did not act on a campaign promise to declare china a currency manipulator on his first day in office. the yuan fell 6.6 percent against the dollar in 2016, its biggest annual drop since 1994, as it was pressured by worries about slowing chinese growth and more recently by a resurgent dollar, which has spurred capital outflows from many emerging markets. chinese authorities have taken numerous steps in recent months to curb capital flight to support the weakening yuan currency, while trying to bring in more foreign investment. geng said there was no basis for the continued devaluation of the chinese currency and he hoped “the relevant side can fully and correctly view the renminbi exchange rate issue”.  but china’s foreign exchange regulator said this month the  economy still faced weak global demand and financial market volatility caused by expectations of further interest rate rises by the u.s. federal reserve.

" china is focused on solving the korean peninsula nuclear issue through talks and peaceful means, chinese president xi jinping told u.s. president donald trump in a telephone call on wednesday. the united states and south korea have asked the united nations to consider tough new sanctions on north korea after its nuclear test on sunday that pyongyang said was an advanced hydrogen bomb. washington and its allies have said there is a growing urgency for china, north korea s top ally and trading partner, to apply more pressure on its already isolated neighbor to get it to back down on its nuclear weapons and missiles programs. china s focus on negotiations contrasts with trump s assertions over the last few days that now was not the time to focus on talks with north korea. in a telephone call with u.k. prime minister theresa may on tuesday,  president trump reiterated that now is not the time to talk to north korea, and made clear that all options remain open to defend the united states and its allies against north korean aggression,  the white house said on wednesday. however, the issue was not mentioned in a separate white house statement on the trump xi call, which said only that the two leaders recognized the danger posed by north korea and committed to working together with the goal of denuclearizing the korean peninsula. earlier, a statement from china s foreign ministry said china  unswervingly  works to realize denuclearization on the korean peninsula and to safeguard the international nuclear non proliferation system, xi told trump.  at the same time, we always persist in safeguarding peace and stability on the korean peninsula and resolving the issue through dialogue and consultation,  xi said.  it is necessary to stay on the path of a peaceful solution.  xi also said that china attaches importance to trump s visit to china later this year. the statement cited trump as saying that the united states was deeply concerned about the korean nuclear issue and that it valued china s  important role  in resolving the problem. u.s. ambassador to the united nations nikki haley accused north korean leader kim jong un on monday of  begging for war  and urged the security council to impose the  strongest possible  sanctions. beijing has said reining in north korea is not chiefly its responsibility, and has expressed doubts that u.n. economic sanctions, which it has backed, will resolve the situation. sanctions so far appear to have done little to stop north korea from boosting its nuclear and missile capacity as it faces off with trump, who has vowed to stop pyongyang from being able to hit the u.s. mainland with a nuclear weapon. it is unclear if china will back further sanctions. beijing fears that completely cutting off north korea could lead to its collapse, unleashing a wave of refugees into china s northeast. china accounted for 92 percent of north korea s trade in 2016, according to south korea. china s foreign ministry said on tuesday it would take part in security council discussions in  a responsible and constructive manner . china and russia have advocated a plan in which the united states and seoul stop major military drills in exchange for north korea halting its weapons programs, but neither side is willing to budge. trump and xi last spoke by telephone on aug. 12. the white house said at the time that their relationship was  extremely close  and  will hopefully lead to a peaceful resolution of the north korea problem.  but tensions in china u.s. ties have increased since trump took office, with the u.s. president having authorized an investigation into china s alleged theft of intellectual property, and suggesting trade relations would be linked to beijing s help on north korea.

" beijing s city authorities have taken down from their website a policy document put up just a few days ago that looked to help improve the city s notorious air quality by banning construction during winter months. it is unclear if the move means the prohibition is no longer in place, with an official at the beijing municipal commission of housing and urban rural development who gave his name as yu saying the document had been pulled from the website due to misunderstandings over the rules in media reports. he declined to give further details. the statement, dated sept. 15, was posted on the commission s website last friday, but it was no longer available on wednesday. it was not clear when it was withdrawn. under the plan, all construction of road and water projects, as well as demolition of housing, would be banned from nov. 15 to march 15 within the city s six major districts and surrounding suburbs. as part of dust control measures, the government often instructs construction sites in northern cities to close during bouts of heavy smog in the winter when households crank up heating, drawing on the power grid which is mainly fueled by coal. provincial authorities are rushing to enforce the central government s ambitious targets for preventing toxic air during the upcoming colder months as it has ramped up its years long war on smog. the possible pulling of the construction rules underscores the complexity of implementing some of the steps. among the most stringent measures are orders for heavy industry such as steel mills to curb output by as much as 50 percent during the colder months. recent checks of factories across the north have forced many to close or curb operations, roiling supplies of some critical raw materials like coke and coal and sending prices of base metals soaring.

" amnesty international urged egyptian authorities on tuesday to release 24 nubian activists detained last week on charges of protesting without permission as they rallied for resettlement on the banks of the nile river. for half a century, egypt s nubians have lobbied the government in cairo for a return to their homelands on the banks of the upper nile, desperate to reclaim territory their ancestors first cultivated 3,000 years ago.  egyptian authorities have long since marginalized nubians, ignoring their demands to return to their historical lands and treating nubian activism as suspicious on security grounds,  amnesty international s north africa campaigns director najia bounaim said in a statement.  instead of flagrantly flouting nubians  rights to freedom of expression and assembly by continuing to detain them over their peaceful protest, the authorities must release these 24 activists from custody immediately.  according to the statement, the activists had not marched far before they were surrounded and beaten by security officers. the activists  lawyer, mohamed abdel salam, told reuters last week they were also charged with incitement of protests and disrupting public safety.

" u.s. vice president mike pence said on wednesday that washington would work with its allies and china to put economic and diplomatic pressure on north korea but added that america would defeat any attack with an “overwhelming response”. pence arrived in tokyo on tuesday from south korea and reassured japan of u.s. commitment to reining in north korea’s nuclear and missile ambitions in a series of meetings with japanese leaders, including prime minister shinzo abe. speaking aboard the uss ronald reagan, a nimitz class aircraft carrier undergoing scheduled maintenance at its home port of yokosuka, pence said u.s. intentions remained unwavering in the face of the threat posed by the reclusive north, which has conducted a series of missile and nuclear tests in defiance of u.n. sanctions, most recently with a failed missile launch on sunday.  “those who would challenge our resolve or readiness should know, we will defeat any attack and beat any use of conventional or nuclear weapons with an overwhelming and effective american response,” pence said to loud applause, reiterating that all options are on the table in dealing with pyongyang. pence made his remarks as the white house grappled with controversy over the location of the uss carl vinson aircraft carrier strike group that u.s. president donald trump said last week had been sent to near the korean peninsula as a warning to north korea, but which headed towards australia instead. pence did not mention the carl vinson or the controversy. pence said he had spoken with trump and by 2020 some 60 percent of the u.s. naval fleet would be in the region and japan’s role would grow. “the united states will strengthen its presence in the asia pacific,” he said. “japan will assume a larger role and responsibility in our alliance in the years ahead.” defence officials from the united states, south korea and japan, who were in tokyo for trilateral security talks, said in a statement north korea should give up its weapons development irrevocably. “the officials call on north korea to abandon its nuclear and ballistic missile programs in a complete, verifiable, and irrevocably manner, to cease its provocative actions that only increase tensions in the region,” they said.        a senior north korean official said in an interview with the bbc this week that north korea would conduct missile tests “on a weekly, monthly and yearly basis”, and any military action against it by the united states would prompt “all out war”. north korea’s deputy representative to the united nations, kim in ryong, accused the united states on monday of creating “a situation where nuclear war could break out an any time” and said the north’s next nuclear test would take place “at a time and at a place where our headquarters deems necessary”. chinese foreign ministry spokesman lu kang said all parties should make efforts to resolve the situation. “china expresses serious concern with recent trends about north korea’s nuclear and missile development,” he said.  the situation was tense and china was resolutely opposed to any words or actions that could further raise tension, he added.   north korea regularly threatens to destroy japan, south korea and the united states and it showed no let up in its belligerence after the failed missile test on sunday, a day after putting on a huge display of missiles at a parade in pyongyang. pence also said the united states would protect freedom of navigation and overflight in the south china sea, where beijing is entangled in territorial rows with several southeast asia nations. pence heads for indonesia later on wednesday.

" iran has suggested to six world powers that it may be open to talks about its ballistic missile arsenal, seeking to reduce tension over the disputed programme, iranian and western officials familiar with the overtures told reuters.  tehran has repeatedly vowed to continue building up what it calls defensive missile capability in defiance of western criticism, with washington saying the islamic republic s stance violates its 2015 nuclear deal with the powers. but the sources said that given u.s. president donald trump s threats to ditch the deal reached under his predecessor barack obama, tehran had approached the powers recently about possible talks on some  dimensions  of its missile programme.  during their meeting on the sidelines of the u.n. general assembly last month, iran told members of the (world powers) that it could discuss the missile programme to remove concerns,  an iranian source with knowledge of the meeting told reuters on condition of anonymity. u.s. and western officials did not confirm the matter was discussed at the zarif tillerson meeting. but two u.s. officials said iran had recently been  keeping it alive  by feeding certain media reports and via third parties such as oman. a former u.s. defense department official said iran s overtures had reached washington in recent weeks.  iran has put feelers out saying it is willing to discuss its ballistic missile programme and is using contacts ...  officials who were  holdovers  from the obama administration,  the former official said.  iran s reported approach came after trump called the nuclear accord  an embarrassment  and  the worst deal ever negotiated . he is expected to announce soon that he will decertify the deal, a senior administration official said on thursday.  such a step could unravel the breakthrough agreement   seen by supporters as crucial to forestalling a middle east arms race and tamping down regional tensions, since it limits iran s ability to enrich uranium in exchange for sanctions relief. the other five powers are britain, france, germany, russia and china, all of whom have reaffirmed commitment to the deal. iranian foreign minister mohammad javad zarif met his counterparts from the six powers, including u.s. secretary of state rex tillerson for the first time, on the fringes of the u.n. gathering on sept. 20.  the americans expressed their worries about iran s missile capability and zarif said in reply that the programme could be discussed, the iranian source told reuters.  a u.s. official with first hand knowledge of dealings with the islamic republic said zarif had been recycling offers that  have been lying dormant on the table for some time.  zarif knows that if trump goes ahead and decertifies iran, it (iran) will be on the high ground, and the u.s. will be isolated among the (six powers),  the official said.  iran s foreign ministry spokesman bahram qasemi said on friday tehran s ballistic missile programme was for defence purposes only and non negotiable.  iran has in all bilateral diplomatic meetings, including the recent visit of ... zarif to new york, emphasised that its defensive missile programme is not negotiable,  qasemi was quoted as saying by iranian media.  the u.s. mission at the united nations referred reuters to the u.s. state department for comment. the state department declined to comment on whether possible talks on missiles were addressed at the meeting or whether iran had recently communicated such interest. but it said washington remained committed to  countering the full range of threats the iranian regime poses to the u.s., our allies, and regional stability, including its ballistic missile development . the trump administration has imposed fresh unilateral sanctions on iran, saying its missile tests violate the u.n. resolution that formalised the nuclear deal. it calls on tehran not to undertake activities related to missiles capable of delivering nuclear bombs.  iran says it has no such plans and denies breaching the resolution. iran has one of the biggest ballistic missile programmes in the middle east, viewing it as an essential precautionary defence against the united states and other adversaries, primarily gulf arab states and israel. a senior iranian official, who also asked not to be named, said pragmatist president hassan rouhani, zarif and revolutionary guards commanders have had several meetings with supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei, who has the last say on all iranian policy, to secure his backing for missile talks.  the leader was not optimistic during the meetings because he does not trust americans. others argued that the heightening tension over the missile programme could be resolved through talks,  said the official, involved in backroom negotiations. any talks would not aim to end or suspend iran s missile programme but to  negotiate some dimensions of it, like limiting production of some missiles with specific ranges , he said.  diplomacy worked well in ending the nuclear stand off ... the dispute over the missile programme also can be resolved through talks,  the official said. a third iranian official said tehran would be willing to discuss long range missiles. he did not elaborate.   a u.s. official with extensive experience negotiating with iran said  putting this out there publicly as zarif has done puts pressure on the (trump) administration . a western official said the administration had assessed zarif s approach to be  a stalling tactic by tehran . another western official said iran must present concrete details for missile talks:  what will need to be seen are the specifics on load capability, the distance range of missiles and how many kilograms can a missile warhead carry.   when asked if iran appeared willing to negotiate on its missile programme, a french diplomat said:  we talk about everything with them, including the ballistic programme.   our objective is that this leads to concrete acts. on the ballistic issue they repeat that it s all defensive and has nothing to do with nuclear.

(french president emmanuel) macron is a godsend. more cooperation in crime fighting, the military, asylum, energy and digital is within reach.  in separate comments:  we need there to be a way to leave the euro without having to leave the european union.  conservative wolfgang schaeuble has agreed to relinquish the post of finance minister to become president of parliament, clearing the way for another party to take the key ministry.  it would be fine to have a green finance minister who cuts the tax burden on the middle classes.  in separate comments:  the uptake of new debts must still be ruled out. (tax) relief and investments must be made possible in another way.   in case the fdp becomes part of the government, a new fiscal policy will be of central importance.  ",0

" arab foreign ministers late on saturday urged the united states to abandon its decision to recognize jerusalem as israel s capital, saying the move would increase violence throughout the region. the announcement by president donald trump on wednesday was a  dangerous violation of international law , had no legal impact and was  void , the arab league said in a statement after a session attended by all its members in cairo. trump s endorsement of israel s claim to all of jerusalem as its capital would reverse long standing u.s. policy that the city s status must be decided in negotiations with the palestinians, who want east jerusalem as the capital of their future state.  the decision has no legal effect ... it deepens tension, ignites anger and threatens to plunge region into more violence and chaos,  the arab league said at 3 a.m. local time after hours of meetings that began on saturday evening. it said it would seek a u.n. security council resolution rejecting the u.s. move. lebanon s foreign minister gebran bassil said during the emergency meeting that arab nations should consider imposing economic sanctions against the united states to prevent it moving its israel embassy to jerusalem from tel aviv.  pre emptive measures (must be) taken ... beginning with diplomatic measures, then political, then economic and financial sanctions,  he said, without giving specific details. the arab league statement made no mention of economic sanctions. arab criticism of trump s plan contrasted sharply with the praise washington s traditional arab allies heaped on him at the beginning of his administration in january.

" u.s. president donald trump set out a strong message on trade at a meeting of asia pacific countries in vietnam on friday, saying the united states could no longer tolerate chronic trade abuses and would insist on fair and equal policies. trump said the united states was ready to make a bilateral deal with any country in the indo pacific region, but only on the basis of  mutual respect and mutual benefit .  when the united states enters into a trading relationship with other countries or other peoples, we will from now on expect that our partners will faithfully follow the rules,  he said in the seaside resort of danang.   we expect that markets will be open to an equal degree on both sides and that private investment, not government planners, will direct investment,  he said in a speech ahead of a summit of asia pacific economic cooperation (apec) leaders.     trump arrived in vietnam from china on the fourth leg of a 12 day trip to asia. redressing the balance of trade between asia and the united states is at the center of trump s  america first  policy he says will protect u.s. workers. the difference between trump s and china s approaches was made more stark by comments in a later speech from chinese president xi jinping, who said globalization was an irreversible trend and voiced support for multilateral trade deals. while china has by far the biggest trade surplus with the united states, vietnam is also on the list of those surpluses the trump administration seeks to reduce. apec, which has long championed free trade, has itself been convulsed by the changes under trump. since trump abandoned the trans pacific partnership (tpp) trade deal early in his presidency, the remaining 11 members have struggled to build momentum to keep it alive. leaders of tpp countries are due to meet on friday after talks among ministers ended in confusion on thursday with japan s economy minister saying that they  agree in principle  and his canadian counterpart saying that was not true. trump broke early with the  pivot to asia  of the obama administration, worrying some traditional allies that he would allow china to extend its increasing dominance. danang itself sits on the shore of the south china sea, one of the region s biggest security headaches and where china s neighbors challenge its sweeping claim to most of the waterway as having no basis in law. trump said the region s future depended on upholding  freedom of navigation and overflight, including open shipping lanes . he also mentioned  territorial expansion  among evils such as drugs, people smuggling and terrorism. vietnam has become one of the most vocal critics of china s claims in the south china sea and its construction of artificial islands. in a sign of possible competition with china s grand belt and road plan, trump said he would push the world bank and asian development bank to fund infrastructure development and would reform u.s. development finance institutions. trump said that would  provide strong alternatives to state directed initiatives that come with many strings attached .  above all, we seek friendship and we don t dream of domination,  he said. although he was addressing a meeting alongside the summit of asia pacific leaders, trump repeatedly referred to the indo pacific region and mentioned the importance of india in his speech. danang has a special place in u.s. vietnamese history: it was where the first u.s. ground troops disembarked in 1965 in the escalation of a war that would last another decade before the communist victory. danang was close to some of the heaviest fighting and its air base was the route through which many americans of trump s generation were sent to the war. trump himself did not serve, receiving five deferments   one for bone spurs in his heel.

" governor andrew cuomo and state legislative leaders reached a deal on thursday to raise new york state’s minimum wage towards $15 per hour, but fell short of a uniform state wide increase. the deal outlines a faster rise in new york city, but carves out a slow lane for small businesses and surrounding counties. in less prosperous areas north of the city it rises to $12.50 per hour before a state review of the law’s impact. the minimum wage agreement was part of a broad budget deal that cuomo announced late on thursday. he said the plan included 12 weeks of paid family leave and $4.2 billion in tax cuts. the  $147 billion budget caps spending growth at 2 percent. “i believe that this is the best plan the state has produced in decades,” cuomo told a news conference in the state capital, albany. cuomo has earmarked $100 billion in infrastructure spending in the state. the budget also increases school funding by 6.5 percent to $24.8 billion and freezes tuition at the state university system, suny.    the minimum wage has been a controversial element in difficult budget negotiations that threatened to delay the spending plan past the start of the state’s fiscal year on april 1. the agreement, including the minimum wage, still needs to get approval from lawmakers. under the terms of the deal the minimum wage would rise from its current $9 per hour to $15 over three years in new york city starting on dec. 31, 2016. city businesses with up to 10 employees would be given four years to implement the measure. long island and westchester county around new york city would be given six years to push through the increases while the rest of the state would see the minimum wage rise to $12.50 in five years, with indexed increases to $15 possible after review.    there is also a provision to suspend the increases from 2019 if economic conditions worsen. the compromise is a climb down for cuomo and his fellow democrats who had pushed for a $15 state wide minimum and no carve outs for small businesses. republicans argued that a flat statewide rate could hurt businesses in less wealthy areas. “it may not go to $15. there’s no guarantee, that’s the good thing,” said senator george amedore, a republican representing a constituency upstate, who commented on the agreement to reuters. phil steck, a democratic party assembly member, who represents a district 165 miles (265 km) north of the city, argued that the opposite was true, and a lower minimum wage would be a blow to the upstate economy. “we have a very strapped economy in upstate new york and the surest way to ensure continued poverty is to run a low wage economy,” he said. “if anything, the poorer areas of the state needed an increase in the minimum wage more.”   the multi tier solution could also dampen the national drive  for a $15 minimum wage that has gathered pace as democrats mobilize their base ahead of the presidential election in november. they hailed an important victory when california governor jerry brown and legislators reached an agreement on monday to raise the state’s minimum wage to $15 an hour by 2023. cuomo said new york’s “calibrated” path to raising the minimum wage could be an example for the rest of the county. “it is raising the minimum wage in a way that is responsible and a positive for the overall economy,” he said.

" it will be a new day at the u.s. securities and exchange commission after president elect donald trump installs his choice to run the agency. with trump’s transition team already in regulatory relief mode and promising to revamp the dodd frank financial reform legislation, some rules already are marked for death or dialback. expected on the chopping block soon after trump takes the oath of office is a proposal that would require companies to disclose pay ratios between their ceos and employees. another would require companies to disclose whether their products contain conflict minerals — minerals that were mined in a war torn region of africa. dead for now is any prospect of the sec approving a tough fiduciary rule for financial advisers, say policy experts. trump’s decision to tap former republican sec commissioner paul atkins to help manage the trump team’s transition efforts at the sec and other financial agencies offers a window into some other changes that could be in store. atkins, the founder of the regulatory consulting firm patomak global partners, is viewed by some to be a top contender for the position of sec chairman itself, though as the transition head he could also recommend someone else for that job.   atkins’ well known conservative views on everything from enforcement penalties to corporate governance are likely to be reflected in the sec’s agenda. here are five policy areas likely to change. paul atkins was a staunch critic of the public company accounting oversight board (pcaob), a body created after the enron accounting scandal to police and write new rules for corporate auditors. atkins raised concerns about the board’s budget and high salaries, and advocated against prescriptive accounting rules that he felt constrained auditors from making professional judgments. recently, republicans have criticized the pcaob for taking on more progressive causes, such as proposing companies rotate auditors to reduce conflicts or requiring accounting firms to disclose the name of individual partners working on company audits. the pcaob’s chairman jim doty, who advocated for the controversial reform measures, will almost certainly not be re appointed by the incoming sec chair. “i expect that a new chair will refocus the board’s standard setting agenda on the core audit function,” said hunton & williams partner scott kimpel. “i would expect a return to the basics.” the topic of whether to impose corporate penalties against a company would come under scrutiny. during his time at the sec, atkins advocated for an enforcement approach that he said did not unduly punish corporate shareholders that had already suffered from the misconduct. he called for the sec to carefully weigh who had profited from the bad behavior, and urged the sec to hold individuals accountable for their actions. atkins has long opined that the sec’s rules requiring “best price” execution of stock trades actually skews the market by causing fragmentation and harming price discovery by directing orders away from traditional stock exchanges into “dark pool” trading platforms. as a commissioner, paul atkins was critical of the rule called regulation national market system (nms), saying it could impede true price discovery and encourage gaming of the system. in january 2016 he wrote an opinion piece in the wall street journal calling for the sec to do major surgery on the rule, allowing considerations beyond ‘best price’ and speed to determine order flow. the dodd frank law gave the sec newfound powers to reward whistleblowers who come forward with tips of corporate malfeasance. from august 2011 through fiscal year 2015, the sec has received more than 14,000 tips, and by august of 2016, the program had given out more than $100 million in rewards. but corporate america has long disliked the part of the rule that protects whistleblowers from having to report wrongdoing to their own companies before they tip off the government. in 2011, atkins urged the sec to require whistleblowers to report internally first, saying a failure to do so could undermine compliance programs. whether this will change remains to be seen, especially in the wake of the wells fargo & co scandal, where employees who reported internally about the opening of unauthorized accounts were fired. atkins “cares deeply about the commission and its enforcement program,” said jordan thomas, a whistleblower attorney at labaton sucharow who previously worked in the sec’s enforcement division during atkins’ tenure. “i find it very hard to believe that he would support undermining such a successful program.” atkins was a strong proponent of the 2012 jump start our business startups act, which scaled back some sec rules to help smaller companies raise capital. in testimony on capitol hill, atkins advocated for additional steps to be taken to help smaller companies, including rules to help create venture exchanges for mid cap stocks and broadening efforts to exempt private capital raising rules from regulation by states.

" venezuelan state elections may be repeated in the five states won by the opposition if the governors elect continue to refuse to be sworn in by a controversial pro government legislative superbody, president nicolas maduro warned on friday. his warning came in a televised speech after the government on sunday unexpectedly won 18 of 23 states in a vote which the opposition calls fraudulent. authorities have mandated that all elected governors participate in a ceremony before the pro government constituent assembly, but the five opposition winners did not take part.     anyone who wants to be governor will have to recognize the constituent national assembly; otherwise elections will be repeated in states where the assembly is not recognized,  maduro said at the inauguration of one of the socialist candidates in western lara state.     the opposition says that by law, the oath must be taken before regional parliaments and not before the constituent assembly, but so far none of their candidates have undergone that process and formally assumed their roles.     venezuela s opposition leaders have said they would travel abroad to denounce what they call dirty tricks by the government and outright fraud in the minerals rich state of bolivar. maduro says the opposition cries fraud whenever it loses elections and that venezuela s electoral system is the most secure in the world.

" the u.s. senate panel tasked with vetting labor secretary nominee and fast food executive andrew puzder will hold his confirmation hearing on feb.16, now that his ethics paperwork has been submitted to congress, a committee spokesman said wednesday. puzder’s certification from the office of government ethics arrived at the senate committee on health, education, labor and pensions exactly two months after puzder was nominated to the job by president donald trump. a spokesman for puzder, george thompson, said he expects that puzder will turn in a separate questionnaire to the committee by thursday morning. puzder is the chief executive officer of cke restaurants inc, which owns primarily franchised restaurants including carl’s jr. and hardee’s. tentative plans for puzder’s hearing have been repeatedly postponed amid delays with a review by the office of government ethics. those stem from the complexities surrounding how puzder will divest himself from cke restaurants, which is owned by private equity firm roark capital group. other companies in roark capital’s portfolio include corner bakery, cinnabon, arby’s, carvel and auntie anne’s. senate democrats have been highly critical of puzder, a staunch critic of an overtime rule championed by the former obama administration. his nomination has sparked protests around the country by some cke fast food workers and the union backed “fight for $15” movement to raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour. workers from a number of cke’s franchised locations have also complained of wage and hour concerns and other labor conditions in recent weeks. in a letter to puzder sent on wednesday before the ethics paperwork was sent to the senate, the committee’s ranking democrat, patty murray, said she wanted to receive a “detailed account” of his plans for recusals, divestments and resignations in order to avoid potential conflicts of interest stemming from his business relationship with roark capital group. “the franchise model’s pervasive presence in the fast food industry, the frequency of serious labor violations connected with franchising and your past or present financial interest in roark raise questions regarding your ability to faithfully carry out the department of labor’s mandate,” murray wrote.

"top officials from the justice department and the education department joined forces to write a letter rejecting the obama administration s policy on the nondiscrimination laws and supporting the rollback of the policy. they explained their belief that the directive was improperly devised,  without due regard for the primary role of the states and local school districts in establishing educational policy. this dispute is putting the president in the middle of transgender rights issues, which he expressed his general sympathy for during the campaign. this is an issue that continues to split the republican party and the nation.despite his personal sympathies, though, the president has made it clear that he believes this should be a states rights issue. keeping the federal government in its proper place is another issue that trump promised to address during his time in office, and he seems to be keeping his promise.the washington examiner reported that white house press secretary sean spicer confirmed that the president wants to leave this to the states to decide:  it s a state s rights issue, and that s entirely what he believes,  spicer said.  if a state wants to pass a rule or a law   that s their right. but, it shouldn t be the federal government getting in the way of this. education secretary betsy devos has resisted this change in the past, saying that she is uncomfortable pushing an issue that could bring harm to transgender students.via the new york times:  ms. devos s unease was evident in a strongly worded statement she released on wednesday night, in which she said she considered it a  moral obligation  for every school in america to protect all students from discrimination, bullying and harassment.gay rights protesters have come out en mass to chant and protest for their rights to use the bathroom of their choice. thankfully president trump remains steadfast in his mission to restore order to public schools.(source: new york times)",1
" new jersey governor chris christie and former business executive carly fiorina ended their presidential campaigns on wednesday, narrowing the field challenging front runner donald trump in the race for the 2016 republican nomination. christie, 53, said in a facebook post he was leaving the race “without an ounce of regret,” a day after the combative republican’s sixth place finish in the new hampshire primary raised doubts about his viability as a candidate.  fiorina, 61, a former hewlett packard chief executive, said in a facebook post she would suspend her campaign. the only woman in the republican field placed seventh in new hampshire, one of a series of state by state nominating contests for the nov. 8 election to succeed democratic president barack obama. trump’s remaining opponents, most of them mainstream republicans, will likely benefit from their departures, which leave seven republicans from a field that once had 17 candidates. trump won the new hampshire republican primary by almost 20 points. the fifth place finish of u.s. senator marco rubio of florida, who had hoped to emerge as trump’s main rival after a surprise third place showing in iowa last week, leaves trump without a clear challenger among the so called establishment candidates.  on the democratic side, u.s. senator bernie sanders of vermont, a democratic socialist, easily defeated former secretary of state hillary clinton in the new hampshire primary. the victories in both parties by candidates considered outsiders, testified to the sizable share of american voters upset over the slow economic recovery, immigration and america’s place in the world and who are willing to shake up washington.  trump, 69, a billionaire businessman, has a double digit lead over conservative senator ted cruz of texas in opinion polls for the next republican contest, the south carolina primary on feb. 20, according to a real clear politics average of opinion polls. christie poured much of his campaign’s resources into new hampshire and had considered a good showing there critical. he won only about 7 percent of votes on tuesday, despite a pugnacious performance at a republican debate last weekend. “christie needed to drop out. in short, he does not have the money or organization to be viable in south carolina and beyond,” said monmouth university pollster patrick murray. “christie was certainly hurt by trump stealing his ‘telling it like it is thunder,’ but christie was also out organized in the ultimate retail politics state,” murray said. sanders courts african americans trump’s victory in new hampshire showed pundits were wrong to think he would quickly self destruct based on his penchant for insults and imprecise plans for the presidency. he had lost last week to cruz in the first nominating contest, the iowa caucuses. ohio’s republican governor, john kasich, finished second in new hampshire, followed by cruz, former florida governor jeb bush and rubio. the odds of trump winning the white house, once seen as an extremely long shot, improved significantly after his victory in new hampshire, online betting site ladbrokes plc said. trump is now at 9/2, compared with 7/1 last week, meaning his chances of victory in november are now 18 percent. clinton still had the best odds of becoming president at 50/50, ladbrokes said. on the democratic side, sanders, 74, courted the african american vote on wednesday, having breakfast with civil rights leader the rev. al sharpton at a restaurant in new york city’s harlem neighborhood. clinton, 68, currently has strong support from black voters, who will be crucial in the democratic primary in south carolina on feb. 27.  sharpton and obama met at the same restaurant during obama’s successful 2008 presidential campaign   a piece of symbolism for sanders as he tries to expand his appeal beyond liberals in the u.s. northeast. “my concern is that in january of next year for the first time in american history, a black family will be moving out of the white house,” sharpton, a baptist minister and television talk show host, told reporters afterward. “i do not want black concerns to be moved out with them. we must be front and center and not marginalized. and senator sanders coming here this morning further makes it clear that we will not be ignored,” he said. sharpton discussed a spate of police shootings of black males and other issues with the senator. sharpton said he would not endorse a candidate until he met with clinton. the congressional black caucus will endorse clinton on thursday and its members will be active in supporting her campaign, the washington post reported, citing u.s. democratic representative gregory meeks of new york, chairman of cbc’s political action committee. clinton has a long history of support for civil rights. she also has benefited from husband bill clinton’s popularity in the black community during his presidency, although that became strained during her fierce 2008 primary battle with obama. clinton’s campaign, highlighting her popularity among black and latino voters, said in a statement on tuesday: “it will be very difficult, if not impossible, for a democrat to win the nomination without strong levels of support among african american and hispanic voters.” ",0
" the united states has created  sensational hype  over china s military modernization, the defense ministry has said in reaction to a white house report branding china a competitor seeking to challenge u.s. power. u.s. president donald trump s administration on monday laid out a national security strategy based on trump s  america first  vision, singling out of china and russia as  revisionist powers  seeking not only to challenge u.s. power but to erode its security and prosperity. china s foreign ministry said on tuesday cooperation between china and the united states was the only correct choice. the spokesman for its defense ministry, ren guoqiang, said in a statement posted on the ministry website late on wednesday that the u.s. strategy had  without regard for the facts, created sensational hype over the modernization of china s defenses . ren also said the strategy had  called into question the intentions of china s military development plan  and that it ran counter to peace worldwide and the development of china s relations with the united states. china s contribution to world peace was plain for all to see, he said.  attempts by any country or any document to distort the facts or cast aspersions will be in vain,  ren said. china s armed forces, the world s largest, are in the midst of an ambitious modernization program, which includes investment in technology and new equipment such as stealth fighters and aircraft carriers, as well as cuts to troop numbers. the tough u.s. national security strategy comes after   trump has sought to build strong relations with chinese president xi jinping. trump has called upon xi to ensure china does more to help the united states rein in north korea s nuclear and missile programs. the u.s. administration cited china s growing military might and its efforts to build military bases on manmade islands in the contested south china sea as evidence of chinese attempts to alter the status quo. china says its expansion of islets in the south china sea is for peaceful purposes only and that, as it has irrefutable sovereignty there, no other country has the right to question its actions.

" u.s. senator bob corker eviscerated president donald trump repeatedly on national television on tuesday, calling him a liar who has debased the country in an extraordinary diatribe against a sitting president by a fellow republican. corker, the only senate republican not seeking re election next year, accused the president of telling falsehoods that could easily be proven wrong and of willfully damaging the country’s standing in the world, exposing deepening divisions in the republican party under trump’s white house. “the president has great difficulty with the truth on many issues,” corker told cnn in the first of a series of interviews at the capitol hours before trump was due to meet with senators to seek consensus on proposed tax cuts. “unfortunately world leaders are very aware that much of what he says is untrue,” said corker, in the sharpest of his bitter public exchanges with the president in recent weeks.     “certainly people here are, because these things are provably untrue. they’re just factually incorrect and people know the difference.” speaking later to reporters, corker called trump a bully. trump hit back on twitter after corker’s television interviews, calling the senate foreign relations committee chairman “incompetent” and reprising one of his trademark derisive nicknames.  “he doesn’t have a clue as the entire world was laughing and taking advantage of us. people like liddle’ bob corker have set the u.s. way back,” trump tweeted.  although he is a foreign policy specialist, corker is also a key player in the tax debate. his support could be crucial as republicans seek passage of the white house backed tax plan in the closely divided senate. [nl2n1mz0sh] the senator from tennessee, whose recent announcement he would not seek re election in november 2018 has freed him from the need to stick to a voter friendly script, pulled no punches in his onslaught against trump. he acknowledged that tensions between the two men, once allies, have been building for months. the trump corker clash is the latest to erupt in what has been a sometimes fraught relationship between the president and the politicians who should be his partners in congress.  trump pilloried senate republicans   as a group and by name   after their failure this summer to repeal and replace the 2010 healthcare law known as obamacare, one of his top presidential campaign promises. while corker’s comments were the strongest yet from a fellow republican, trump has also provoked the ire of another respected senior republican, john mccain, whose war record he mocked.  mccain’s barbs prompted trump last week to tell the 80 year old senator, who has brain cancer, to be careful because “i fight back.” the latest exchange began early tuesday morning when corker advised the white house not to interfere in lawmakers’ tax deliberations and called trump’s lunch a “photo op.”  later, trump took to twitter to belittle corker, a national security adviser on his presidential campaign, with an early morning tweet in which he anticipated opposition for his administration’s tax plan. “bob corker, who ... couldn’t get elected dog catcher in tennessee, is now fighting tax cuts,” trump wrote.  that prompted a retort on twitter from corker, “same untruths from an utterly untruthful president.”  with the tax plan, trump is hoping to notch up his first major legislative win   something that has so far eluded him even though republicans both chambers of congress. tensions with corker erupted this month when trump said corker “begged” for his endorsement as he weighed running for re election and corker responded by calling trump’s white house an “adult day care center.” trump has also blamed corker for the iran nuclear deal forged under democratic president barack obama. every republican, including corker, voted against the 2015 accord. in his cnn interview, corker assailed trump for telling falsehoods that are easily disproven and questioned why he persisted in doing so. “i don’t know why he lowers himself to such a low, low standard and debases our country in that way but he does but he does.” “he is purposely breaking down relationships we have around the world that had been useful to our nation. ... i think the debasement of our nation is what he’ll be remembered most for.” corker, who was an early backer of trump’s white house campaign at a time when many senior republicans were expressing doubts, said he would not support him again. “i was one of those   that hoped he would rise to the occasion as president and aspire to lead our nation instead of divide it,” he told reporters at the capitol. “he has not risen to the occasion.”  ",0
" u.s. senate democrats vowed on tuesday to fight a measure expected to be slipped into budget legislation that would open alaska’s arctic national wildlife reserve to oil and gas drilling, saying it would destroy one of earth’s remaining paradises. northern alaska’s anwr is a wilderness about the size of south carolina that supports tribes that have fished and hunted there for thousands of years and is home to polar bears, caribou and birds vulnerable to development.  a plan passed by the senate budget committee late last month contains a directive for the senate energy committee to draw up a provision securing $1 billion in revenue for the budget, which is expected to be voted on late thursday.  the head of the energy panel, senator lisa murkowski, an alaska republican and a longtime proponent of drilling in anwr, is expected to write a provision opening the reserve. she and senator dan sullivan, also an alaska republican, have both supported measures to open up parts of anwr. “this republican budget scam to hand over the wildest place left in america to big oil should be removed from the budget and put on ice,” said senator edward markey.  senator jeff merkley said there is “something cynical and sad” about the effort because it could boost oil output from the u.s. state that is already feeling the fastest effects of climate change, which the overwhelming majority of scientists link to human caused carbon emissions. an environmentalist said republicans were trying to sneak drilling into the budget and eliminate opportunities for debate.  lydia weiss, the director of government relations at the wilderness society, called it an “unacceptable abuse of senate procedure” and said americans deserve to see the senate debate the issue in the open. petroleum interests have long lobbied to explore in the area and say technology advances mean the impact of operations on the reserve would be smaller than in years past.  still, it is uncertain whether energy companies that have faced static crude prices amid a wealth of oil and gas in the continental united states would be willing to increase drilling in the harsh and frigid arctic.   markey said the group is reaching out to republicans for support in opposition to the drilling amendment, which likely will need 50 votes in the 100 member chamber to pass. democrats hope republican senators john mccain and susan collins, who have previously voted against drilling, will support them.

" the united states and germany called on china to immediately release a prominent human rights activist who was jailed for eight years on tuesday for subversion, the harshest sentence passed in a recent crackdown on activism. wu gan, a blogger better known by his online name  super vulgar butcher , regularly championed sensitive cases of government abuses of power, both online and in street protests. he was detained in may 2015 and charged with subversion. in a separate case, also on tuesday, rights lawyer xie yang avoided criminal punishment despite being found guilty of inciting subversion, because he admitted to his crimes.  we call on the chinese authorities to release wu immediately,  the u.s. and germany embassies in china said in a joint statement.  as xie has been exempted from punishment, we urge china to allow xie to resume his professional activities without preconditions and be free of any restrictions.  china s foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment, but beijing frequently denounces foreign concern about rights cases as an interference in internal affairs and says china is a country with rule of law. wu, in a statement released by his lawyers late on tuesday, said he considered the sentence an  honor  as it proved that he had not become a  slave  or  accomplice  to the china s  autocracy .  i got eight years, but i feel no grief or despair. this was my choice, because opposing autocracy means you are already on the road to jail,  wu said in the statement.  i call on the international community to pay attention to china s deteriorating human rights situation,  he added. wu s sentence was the most severe in what rights groups have called an unprecedented attack on rights activists and lawyers, known as the 709 crackdown, which began in full force on july 9, 2015. the hardline approach has shown no sign of softening as president xi jinping enters his second five year term in office, and has drawn widespread concern in western capitals. germany has been particularly outspoken, to china s irritation. speaking at a daily news briefing on wednesday, foreign ministry spokeswoman hua chunying expressed displeasure at comments last week by the german ambassador on china s failure to set up a previously agreed upon cyber consultation mechanism. china had, in fact, invited germany to send representatives to talks, but the germans kept putting china off, hua told reporters. china hoped the ambassador stops saying such  irresponsible remarks , she added.

" u.s. president donald trump’s eldest son met with the u.s. senate intelligence committee on wednesday as part of the panel’s investigation into russia, the 2016 u.s. election and whether his father’s election campaign colluded with moscow. donald trump jr. arrived at a senate office building shortly after 10 a.m. capitol police officers tried to keep journalists from witnessing his arrival, but he was spotted by reporters as he rushed to a room the committee uses for classified briefings. he testified for nine hours, a person familiar with the matter said. u.s. intelligence agencies said after trump’s victory in the november 2016 presidential election that they had concluded russia sought to influence the campaign to boost trump’s chances of defeating former secretary of state hillary clinton, his democratic challenger. moscow has denied any such activity, and trump has dismissed talk of possible collusion as a “witch hunt” led by democrats disappointed about his victory. the senate committee is conducting one of the main congressional investigations. richard burr, the panel’s chairman, told reporters on tuesday he expected its probe to last into 2018, but likely not for many months into the new year. department of justice special counsel robert mueller is also investigating the matter. trump jr. testified to the house intelligence committee last week. lawmakers are interested in talking to him about a meeting with a russian lawyer in june 2016 at trump tower in new york  at which he said he hoped to get information about the “fitness, character and qualifications” of clinton.

" u.s. president donald trump’s administration has instructed the environmental protection agency to remove the climate change page from its website, two agency employees told reuters, the latest move by the newly minted leadership to erase ex president barack obama’s climate change initiatives.  the employees were notified by epa officials on tuesday that the administration had instructed epa’s communications team to remove the website’s climate change page, which contains links to scientific global warming research, as well as detailed data on emissions. the page could go down as early as wednesday, the sources said.  don’t miss: dow hits 20,000 as post election rally roars back to life insight: how russia sold its oil jewel   without saying who bought it opinion: trump probably can't require pipelines to use u.s. steel “if the website goes dark, years of work we have done on climate change will disappear,” one of the epa staffers told reuters, who added some employees were scrambling to save some of the information housed on the website, or convince the trump administration to preserve parts of it.  the sources asked not to be named because they were not authorized to speak to the media.  a trump administration official did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  the order comes as trump’s administration has moved to curb the flow of information from several government agencies who oversee environmental issues since last week, in actions that appeared designed to tighten control and discourage dissenting views.  the moves have reinforced concerns that trump, a climate change doubter, could seek to sideline scientific research showing that carbon dioxide emissions from burning fossil fuels contributes to global warming, as well as the career staffers at the agencies that conduct much of this research.  myron ebell, who helped guide the epa’s transition after trump was elected in november until he was sworn in last week, said the move was not surprising.  “my guess is the web pages will be taken down, but the links and information will be available,” he said.  the page includes links to the epa’s inventory of greenhouse gas emissions, which contains emissions data from individual industrial facilities as well as the multiagency climate change indicators report, which describes trends related to the causes and effects of climate change.  the trump administration’s recently appointed team to guide the post obama transition has drawn heavily from the energy industry lobby and pro drilling think tanks, according to a list of the newly introduced 10 member team.  trump appointed oklahoma attorney general scott pruitt, a longtime foe of the epa who has led 14 lawsuits against it, as the agency’s administrator. the senate environment committee held a tense seven hour confirmation hearing for pruitt last week. no vote on his nomination has been scheduled yet.

" behind the scenes at the white house, u.s. president donald trump’s daughter ivanka was a key advocate for the more measured, less combative tone he struck in his speech to a joint session of congress on tuesday night, officials said. the biggest speech of trump’s month old presidency was the product of a 10 day effort with his top aides.  while he unveiled no significant changes to policy, the tone of trump’s speech was a far cry from his bleak “american carnage” inaugural address when he took office on jan. 20. the republican president dropped some of the fierce rhetoric that had been a staple of his first weeks in office. he called for national unity and avoided a repeat of his attacks on democratic opponents and media organizations. polls conducted immediately after the speech showed a clear majority of americans approved of the softer approach and aides described trump as buoyed by the reception. a senior white house official said ivanka trump made  recommendations for the speech during a brainstorming session in the oval office on sunday, helping her father decide on a new approach aimed at easing concerns over whether he had the right temperament to govern effectively.  “he had a lot of voices around him giving him ideas and suggestions that he incorporated, but he really set out to achieve that optimistic tone and that was something she was supportive of. she encouraged him to do that,” one official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. “she had a role,” said another. “she helped set the tone.” ivanka trump also persuaded her father to speak favorably about affordable child care and paid family leave, policies she has long backed and which could draw support from democrats in congress, said another official with some knowledge of how the speech evolved. “her fingerprints are visible on the tone, but especially on those parts of it like maternity leave that matter to her,” the official said. ivanka trump, 35, the president’s older daughter, has emerged as an influential informal adviser for her father, particularly on issues important to women and minorities.  after his election victory last november, she stepped away from her business interests in new york to move to washington and is frequently seen at her father’s events. a white house official said trump was the principal author of the speech but had a lot of help in drafting it, including from his daughter. trump made the final changes to his speech during a marathon session on tuesday, working closely with vice president mike pence, chief strategist steve bannon, chief of staff reince priebus and chief speechwriter stephen miller. ivanka trump’s husband, jared kushner, is a senior white house adviser with particular interest in trade deals and middle east diplomacy.  the couple have been among the president’s closest confidants since his election campaign, and kushner also helped in the drafting of the speech to congress.  others involved in the last round of deliberations were white house aides hope hicks, kellyanne conway and sean spicer. ivanka trump was not in the sessions on tuesday. ivanka trump accompanied her father to dover air base in delaware on feb. 1 to welcome home the remains of u.s. navy seal william “ryan” owens, who was killed in a raid on al qaeda in yemen. at the speech on tuesday, owens’ widow, carryn owens, wept openly when trump led the crowd in applauding her husband’s service. standing next to her was ivanka trump. presidential historian thomas alan schwartz of vanderbilt university said it was hard to find a similar example in recent history of a presidential daughter having a big influence. “it’s a way of reaching out on social issues and social welfare issues or issues that sometimes the republicans are less identified with,” he said.

" nato has joined world powers  diplomatic efforts to stop north korea s missile program but it cannot yet rely on its u.s. built shield to defend europe, experts and diplomats said. the united states says the shield, more than a decade in the planning, is needed to protect against so called rogue states, a term u.s. officials have used to refer to north korea and iran.  but with berlin, paris and london potentially within striking distance of north korea s missiles from next year, officials say the u.s. led alliance s system needs more radars and special interceptors to destroy a rocket from pyongyang.  the nato shield in its current state lacks the reach and early warning radars to shoot down north korean rockets. it s a weak link,  said michael elleman, a missile defense analyst at the international institute for strategic studies (iiss).  early tracking is also difficult because north korean missiles would be flying over russia, where nato obviously cannot put radars,  he added. the sort of interceptor needed to shoot down north korean ballistic missiles could breach a soviet era arms control agreement between the united states and russia because of its greater range, arms experts say. moscow has long objected to u.s. missile shield plans, saying their real aim is to neutralize russia s own nuclear arsenal, rather than meet the perceived threat from  rogue states . russia s strategic concerns would, therefore, make it hard to renegotiate the 1987 intermediate range nuclear forces (inf) treaty, something arms experts say would be required if a north korean missile shield were to be fully effective.  alliance planning to confront any threat from pyongyang is in its infancy. following north korea s country s sixth and most powerful nuclear test on sept. 3, two senior nato diplomats told reuters that protection against the north korean threat was only beginning to be considered at nato headquarters in brussels. that was despite a more forceful diplomatic tone on the crisis and warnings on the scale and immediacy of the threat from u.s. president donald trump s new ambassador to nato, france s defense minister and the alliance s deputy head. while analysts do not expect north korea to have a reliable intercontinental ballistic missile until next year at the earliest, nato s european allies could become a target as a way of threatening their closest partner, the united states, a third nato diplomat said, stressing that was only speculation. the united states switched on its $800 million european missile defense umbrella in may last year at a site in romania to protect against iranian rockets.  the system, controlled from a nato base in germany, includes radars and interceptors stretching from eastern europe to the mediterranean.  a final site in poland should be ready by late 2018, extending the european umbrella from greenland and the azores.    to shoot down a ballistic missile from north korea would require a new generation of interceptor, the block ii, which is still in development. it is capable of downing ballistic rockets earlier and at a much higher altitude. however, elleman said that u.s. missile sites in alaska and california, as well as in japan and south korea, were likely to be given priority before europe, when they are ready in 2018.  there will be a lot of competition for the assets,  he said.

"wisconsin police were widening their hunt saturday for a 32-year-old man who allegedly burglarized a gun store after mailing an anti-government manifesto to president donald trump.joseph jakubowski has been on the run since tuesday, when police say he broke into the armageddon gun shop in janesville, south of madison, and stole 16 high-caliber rifles and handguns. he is believed to be armed and dangerous, and traveling with a bulletproof vest and helmet, according to authorities.at a news conference friday, rock county sheriff robert spoden said jakubowski had been highly agitated by national politics recently and had confessed to friends that he had plans to steal guns and conduct an  unspecified attack. janesville police chief david moore said his department has also had multiple run-ins with jakubowski over the years. there was one specific case where he attempted to disarm a police officer,  moore told reporters.  were it not for the very secure holster of this police officer, he would have certainly disarmed that police officer. and for that crime, (he) was sent to prison.  police released a video jakubowski allegedly posted to facebook that shows a man mailing a large envelope clearly addressed to trump and the white house.authorities say the package contained a 160-page manifesto that featured anti-government rants and  personal angst against anything other than natural law or rule.

" ohio’s republican governor, john kasich, took over the white house briefing lectern on friday to praise the 12 nation trans pacific partnership, an unusual move that shows how hard president barack obama will push for the trade deal’s approval. obama, a democrat who is leaving office in four months, met with the governor, who fell short in his bid to be the republican presidential candidate, in the white house oval office to discuss strategies for overcoming domestic political angst over the tpp. the unlikely partnership comes as the white house makes a final full court push to persuade republican congressional leaders to approve the deal in a “lame duck” session after the nov. 8 election. both republican and democratic candidates have pilloried the tpp. “we cannot get to the point in america that because a democrat wants something, you can’t agree with them,” kasich said in an impassioned plea to republican lawmakers to back the deal, which is a key part of obama’s foreign policy legacy. kasich said the deal is vital for the u.s. economy and also to counter china and russia, and said business leaders need to apply pressure on lawmakers to approve it. “right now, china is pushing hard to create their own trade agreement,” obama told reporters in the oval office ahead of the meeting, saying u.s. businesses were at risk of being “cut out” of asia, the world’s fastest growing market. “i promise you that china’s not going to be setting up a bunch of rules that are going to be to the advantage of american companies and american businesses,” obama said. other business and political leaders also attended the meeting, including former republican treasury secretary henry paulson, international business machines corp chief executive officer virginia rometty and former new york city mayor michael bloomberg. republicans traditionally have backed free trade deals, but the party’s presidential candidate, donald trump, has blamed the agreements for u.s. job losses and threatened to tear them up should he win. senate majority leader mitch mcconnell has said the tpp would not get a senate vote this year, and house of representatives speaker paul ryan has said he does not see enough votes for it to pass. democratic presidential candidate hillary clinton has also opposed the deal, which is unpopular with labor unions and environmental groups. obama has said he hopes opposition cools after the election. the white house has pointed to opinion polls showing most americans support trade as a sign that the tpp could still squeak through congress. “if you’re frustrated about rules of trade that disadvantage america, if you’re frustrated about jobs being shipped overseas ... then you want to get this thing passed,” obama told reporters. on his final trip to asia as president earlier this month, obama spent time reassuring nervous partners that the united states would finalize the tpp. but on friday, vietnam’s parliament indicated it would not ratify the deal quickly. white house spokesman josh earnest said vietnam’s decision was not a setback. “i think the real stumbling block, the real impediment, the obstacle here is (the u.s.) congress,” earnest said, noting there was “every indication” that vietnam would proceed as long as congress approved the tpp. ",0
" germany s conservative chancellor angela merkel may have won her fourth consecutive national election, but she faces a huge challenge in trying to forge a three way alliance between parties far apart on the political spectrum. despite winning most votes, merkel s bloc slumped to its worst result since 1949 and, just as significant in terms of government building, her current social democrat (spd) coalition partners said they would go into opposition after slumping to 20.7 percent in projections, a post war low. merkel herself indicated that she had only one other option to govern.  jamaica  is the name given to a tie up between her conservative bloc, the pro business free democrats (fdp) and environmentalist greens, from the fact that island s flag is made up of the black, yellow and green colors of the three parties. projections put the conservatives, comprising merkel s christian democrats (cdu) and bavarian christian social union (csu) on 33.0 percent, the fdp on 10.6 and the greens on 8.9   enough for a workable majority. but such an alliance, untested at a federal level, collapsed in january 2012 in the western state of saarland after little more than two years, although it has been tried again since may in the northern state of schleswig holstein. on a national level, it would have to overcome deep differences on eu reform, tax, energy and immigration. both the greens and fdp, fearing alienating their supporters with the compromises they would have to make, played down the likelihood of such a partnership. the prospect of sharing power in europe s biggest economy will be a powerful incentive, however. they may also feel a duty to ensure the far right alternative for germany (afd), whose anti islam and anti immigrant rhetoric have for many raised uncomfortable echoes of germany s nazi past, does not become the main opposition party. fueled by voter anger over merkel s decision in 2015 to admit around a million migrants, mostly fleeing conflict in the middle east, the afd won 13 percent of the vote to become the third biggest bloc, and the first far right party in the national parliament for over half a century.  it will be very difficult but we all have a responsibility to our country. we don t want new elections,  said conservative interior minister thomas de maiziere, adding that such a scenario would probably give further momentum to the afd. an ultimate coalition deal may be more about showing germany s commitment to democratic values than securing broad agreement on policy, where the pro business fdp and the left leaning greens, in particular, are poles apart.  greens co leader cem ozdemir said his party would not participate in  anti european populism  in a coalition with the conservatives and fdp. although the low tax, red tape cutting fdp is traditionally a pro european party, its young leader, christian lindner, has rejected ideas put by french president emmanuel macron for deeper euro zone integration.  we want to reverse the trend for our country and, if it becomes apparent in talks that these goals can be achieved, then of course we will be available, but if not, it would be our task to go into opposition,  said lindner. he has also said russia s annexation of crimea from ukraine in 2014 might have to be accepted as a permanent provisional arrangement. it is hard to see how merkel could swallow that. the greens emphasize climate policy and want a commitment to phase out coal power by 2030, which would be difficult for the other parties to agree to.  refugee policy will also be challenging, especially with the fdp and merkel s bavarian partners of the csu taking a much harder line than the greens on limiting immigration. berenberg economist holger schmieding argued that in the carve up of ministries under a jamaica coalition, wolfgang schaeuble, conservative finance minister since 2009, may have to yield his post to the fdp.  (that) would tilt the domestic discussion a bit further toward serious income tax cuts,  he said. ",0

" china s ruling communist party announced a new central committee, the largest of its elite ruling bodies, at the closing session of the 19th communist party congress on tuesday, a course setting leadership reshuffle held every five years. the list provides clues to who will, or won t, fill top party positions during president xi jinping s second term. the party will announce its new politburo standing committee around midday (0400 gmt) on wednesday. the standing committee, which now includes seven members headed by xi and is the apex of power in china, is selected by the new central committee.  here are noteworthy names:   wang qishan, 69, the anti corruption tsar and current standing committee member, is not on the new central committee, ending months of speculation whether he would remain for another term and break an unofficial retirement rule of not taking a new position after age 68.  wang may still get a leadership role outside the standing committee, sources told reuters before the congress.   zhao leji, 60, head of the party s organization department, which oversees personnel decisions, made both the central committee and the central commission for discipline inspection committee lists, suggesting he may take over wang qishan s role as top graft buster.   vice president li yuanchao, who is on the cusp of retirement at the age of 67, is expected to retire from the 25 member politburo after he was not included on the 204 member central committee.   china s top diplomat, yang jiechi, 67, could keep his state councilor job or be further promoted to parliament or its advisory body after he made it back to the central committee.  if yang retires, foreign minister wang yi, 64 this month, and song tao, 62, minister of the party s international liaison department, are the top contenders for yang s job. both wang and song are central committee members.   veteran diplomat liu jieyi, 59, china s permanent representative to the united nations, was elected to the central committee and is expected to take over as minister of the taiwan affairs office, replacing zhang zhijun, who is retiring.   transport minister li xiaopeng, 58, the oldest son of former premier li peng, became a full member of the central committee. he was the lowest vote getter among alternate members of the central committee five years ago.   ten women made it onto the committee, 4.9 percent of the total, basically the same proportion as the previous central committee. there were also 16 delegates from ethnic minorities, three of whom are women.   china s top banking regulator guo shuqing, veteran banker jiang chaoliang and securities regulator liu shiyu, the three front runners to succeed zhou xiaochuan as central bank governor, were all voted onto the central committee.

" a leading conservative republican, who helped block president donald trump’s healthcare bill, said on thursday that congress should begin rigorous debate on tax reform now if it hopes to pass legislation before an august deadline. the quest to revamp the tax code moved to the top of trump’s legislative agenda after a republican push to repeal and replace president barack obama’s signature healthcare law failed in the house of representatives on march 24 in a humiliating defeat for the president and his party. to tackle the biggest overhaul of the u.s. tax code since the reagan era quickly, house republicans need to avoid the political fault lines that sank their healthcare bill, partly by having conservatives on board. house republicans hope to vote on a tax reform bill before they leave for summer recess at the end of july. “we can get it done before august as long as we are real serious about having real debate... debate has to be about changing policy,” said representative mark meadows, chairman of the house freedom caucus, a group of about three dozen staunchly conservative lawmakers. “i’m optimistic on tax reform, if we do it differently than we did healthcare,” he told a forum hosted by politico. freedom caucus members complained that house republican leaders held no healthcare hearings this year before legislation was introduced and kept their bill to repeal and replace the affordable care act under wraps until just before it was introduced. meadows said the tax reform debate boils down to a decision between a controversial “border adjustment tax” plan backed by house speaker paul ryan and deficit funded reforms. he did not take a position on thursday but recently said his group could support reforms that are not revenue neutral. “we need to go ahead and start having those discussions today. let’s look at legislative text,” he said. house ways and means committee chairman kevin brady plans to hold public hearings on tax reform issues in coming weeks. on thursday, brady offered no indication that legislation was imminent but said he understood the need for rank and file members to have input. “we continue to work toward spring action from the ways and means committee and continue to work to get this done in 2017,” brady told reporters. “one lesson we learned in the healthcare debate is that members of congress want plenty of time, not just to review the bill but to have input into tax reform.” ",0
" u.s. house of representatives speaker paul ryan said on thursday he expected to have legislation to replace, as well as repeal, the affordable care act this year. “our legislating will occur this year,” ryan, a wisconsin republican, said at a news briefing. “what date all of this gets phased in on is something we do not now know,” partly because the administration is not in office yet.

" u.s. vice president joe biden said on tuesday that the united states would speed up the approval of promising new drug combinations in his government’s newly announced drive to cure cancer “once and for all”. biden, who lost his 46 year old son beau to brain cancer last year, set out his plans at a world economic forum meeting of international cancer experts in davos, a week after being appointed to lead the initiative by president barack obama. so called combination therapy is increasingly seen as central to fighting tumours, as scientists unlock the different genetic factors driving cancer cell growth, but bringing such cocktails to market can be a slow and costly.  biden said he had hosted a meeting at his home with three unnamed large drug companies and the head of the u.s. food and drug administration (fda) at which both sides had pledged to do more to get novel cancer drug cocktails to patients. “the head of the fda made a commitment that everybody would move much more rapidly in approving combinations,” biden said. at the same, the pharmaceutical industry executives had all said they were “open to different way of doing business” in order to ensure that promising drugs from different companies were tested together as early as possible, he added. cancer experts are particularly excited by the promise of new immunotherapy medicines that help the body’s immune system fight tumours and which have been shown to work well when used alongside other drugs. francis collins, director of the u.s. national institutes of health, described their potential as “breath taking”. but such immunotherapy drugs are expensive   typically costing well over $100,000 a year per patient   and companies have traditionally been defensive about sharing early stage medical experiments. obama’s call to “make america the country that cures cancer once and for all” in the last state of the union address of his presidency has led to criticism from some scientists of an over simplified approach to the killer condition. the latest government led initiative has echoes of former president richard nixon’s unsuccessful “war on cancer” in the 1970s, since when scientists have discovered that cancer is hundreds of different diseases rather than one single disorder, making the notion of a single cure outdated. biden acknowledged the complexity in davos. “i’m not naive enough to think or suggest we are going to have a cure for every cancer in the world in the near term,” he said.

" u.s. president donald trump will urge president xi jinping to make good on his commitments to pressure north korea when he visits china next month, a senior white house official said on monday, stepping up a strategy to have beijing help rein in pyongyang. isolating north korea further over its nuclear and ballistic missile tests is a key goal for trump on what will be his longest foreign trip to date. trump will call on xi to fully implement u.n. security council resolutions against pyongyang and take other steps to pressure north korea.  china, north korea s sole major ally, accounts for more than 90 percent of trade with the isolated country. china has said it will strictly enforce u.n. security council sanctions banning imports of coal, textiles and seafood, while cutting off oil shipments to the north.      but a senior white house official who briefed reporters ahead of trump s trip said china needs to do more to comply with two u.n. security council resolutions that were approved unanimously, including with china s support.  we would like to see china follow through on those commitments. we would like to see china do things bilaterally as well that might even go beyond things that are mandated by those u.n. security council resolutions,  the official said. though china has been angered by north korea s repeated nuclear and missile tests and demanded they stop, beijing also sees the united states and south korea sharing responsibility for rising tensions because of military drills they carry out in the region. south korea, the united states and japan started a two day missile tracking drill on tuesday, south korea s military said in a statement, in preparation for any missile or nuclear threats from north korea. the exercises will be held in waters off the coasts of south korea and japan, south korea s joint chiefs of staff said, with four aegis combat system equipped ships from all three countries participating in the drill. china s special envoy for the north korea nuclear issue, kong xuanyou, met his u.s. counterpart, joseph yun, in beijing on monday, china s foreign ministry said, where they had a  deep exchange of views on the korean peninsula issue . the ministry did not elaborate. trump, who has threatened to  totally destroy  north korea, has frequently asked china to help rein in north korean leader kim jong un. but this strategy has so far failed to stop pyongyang conducting nuclear bomb tests at an underground facility and firing ballistic missile tests into the pacific ocean over japan. the threat from north korea has grown to a  critical and imminent level  and the united states, japan and south korea must address the matter, japanese defence minister itsunori onodera told his u.s. and south korean counterparts in talks on monday. onodera s remarks underscored the deep concern in tokyo about north korean weapons tests as pyongyang seeks to develop a nuclear tipped missile capable of reaching the united states. the white house official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said trump is looking for a peaceful resolution of the north korea standoff. asked by reporters whether an offer by former president jimmy carter to serve as a u.s. envoy to north korea would be accepted, the official said:  there s nothing planned.  singapore prime minister lee hsien loong said on monday he outlined for trump his country s efforts to pressure north korea over its nuclear program but also advised the u.s. leader to use talks to help resolve the conflict.  there is no quick and easy solution. pressure is necessary but so is dialogue. the u.s. will need to work with others, including china, south korea and japan and russia to resolve the issue,  he said. with xi consolidating power in the wake of a communist party congress in beijing, trump believes the chinese president will have a greater authority to take steps against north korea, senior administration officials said last week. trump s nov. 3 14 trip will include visits to japan, south korea, china, vietnam and the philippines. trump will also be tough on trade during talks with xi as he seeks to reduce the u.s. trade deficit with china, the white house official said.  we have huge barriers that americans companies have to surmount to gain access to the chinese market. the president is intent on rectifying that situation,  the official said.    despite trump s fierce criticism of china s trade practices during the presidential campaign, he has mostly held off on any major trade action while his administration works with beijing on north korea. china has insisted it is doing all it can, and some chinese diplomats say the trump administration has overestimated how much influence beijing has over its defiant neighbor. even as china has shown signs of tightening enforcement of sanctions on north korea, it has stopped short of agreeing to u.s. demands for a fuel embargo and has urged the united states to negotiate with pyongyang.

" opinion polls show vladimir putin is already a shoo in to win a fourth presidential term. but a ban on russia taking part in the winter olympics is likely to make support for him even stronger, by uniting voters around his message: the world is against us. putin announced on wednesday that he would run for re election in march s presidential vote, setting the stage for him to extend his dominance of russia s political landscape into a third decade. with ties between the kremlin and the west at their lowest point for years, the international olympic committee s decision to bar russia from the 2018 pyeongchang games over doping is seen in moscow as a humiliating and politically tinged act. putin, echoing his familiar refrain that his country is facing a treacherous western campaign to hold it back, said he had  no doubt  that the ioc s decision was  absolutely orchestrated and politically motivated .  russia will continue moving forwards, and nobody will ever be able to stop this forward movement,  putin said. konstantin kosachyov, head of the upper house of parliament s foreign affairs committee, had been among the first to cast the move as part of a western plot against russia, which sees sport as a barometer of geopolitical influence.  they are targeting our national honor ... our reputation ... and our interests. they (the west) bought out the traitors ... and orchestrated media hysteria,  kosachyov wrote on social media. the ioc ruling is also seen by many in russia as a personal affront to putin, who was re elected president in 2012 after  spending four years as prime minister because the constitution barred him from a third consecutive term as head of state.  the sport loving leader cast his hosting of the 2014 sochi winter olympics, at which the ioc says there was  unprecedented systematic manipulation  of the anti doping system, as a symbol of russia s success under his rule. but putin has often extracted political benefit from crises, and turned international setbacks into domestic triumphs, by accusing the west of gunning for russia and using this to inspire russians to unite.  outside pressure on russia, understood as politically motivated and orchestrated from the u.s., leads to more national cohesion,  dmitri trenin, director of the carnegie moscow center, said on wednesday.  various sanctions are being turned into instruments of nation building.  putin s popularity, supported by state television, is already high. opinion polls regularly give him an approval rating of around 80 percent.  but casting the ioc ban as a western plot to hurt russia, something he did when russian athletes were banned from last year s summer olympics in rio over doping, could help him mobilize the electorate. public anger over the ioc move could help putin overcome signs of voter apathy and ensure a high turnout which, in the tightly controlled limits of the russian political system, is seen as conferring legitimacy. there were early signs that fury over the ioc s decision was duly stirring patriotic fervor.  russia is a superpower,  alexander kudrashov, a member of the russian military historical society, told reuters on moscow s red square after the ioc ruling. without russia, he said, the olympics would not be valid.  he linked the decision to a western anti russian campaign which many russians believe took hold after russia annexed the crimea peninsula from ukraine in 2014.    choosing between the people in crimea, who wept when the russian flag was run up and who were doomed to genocide, and  sportspeople taking first place on the podium, i choose the people who couldn t defend themselves,  kudrashov said.    blaming the west is an approach the kremlin has often used before when faced with international allegations of wrongdoing   over crimea s annexation, the shooting down of a malaysian passenger plane over ukraine in july 2014 and charges of meddling in eastern ukraine, where pro russian separatists  rebelled against rule from kiev after crimea was annexed. the tactic taps into russians  patriotism and makes putin almost bullet proof when it comes to scandal. the 65 year old former kgb agent is regarded by many voters as a tsar like father of the nation figure who has brought their country back from the brink of collapse.  when at the start of the year it seemed there was a window to repair relations with the west after the election of u.s. president donald trump, who said he wanted better ties, the narrative of russia versus the world was muted.  but when it became clear that u.s. allegations of russian meddling in trump s election precluded any rapprochement, putin doubled down on the narrative. in october, he launched a stinging critique of u.s. policy, listing what he called the biggest betrayals in u.s. russia relations.  sources close to the russian government say the ioc ban, along with continued western sanctions over ukraine and the prospect of new sanctions, will help the authorities rally voters around the banner of national unity which putin embodies.  outside pressure just makes us stronger,  said one such source who declined to be named because he is not authorized to speak to the media. maria zakharova, a spokeswoman for the foreign ministry, set the tone on social media in comments that found ready support from many russians.  what haven t we been forced to suffer from our  partners  in the course of our history,  she wrote.  but they just can t bring us down. not via a world war, the collapse of the soviet union or sanctions ... we soak it up and survive.

" any united nations peacekeepers sent to eastern ukraine must be granted access to the entirety of the region held by moscow backed separatists, german chancellor angela merkel said. russian president vladimir putin floated the idea of deploying u.n. troops to eastern ukraine in a monday call with merkel, suggesting that the u.n. mission could protect observers from the international osce monitoring mission. with growing calls in germany for the lifting of european union sanctions against russia over its activities in ukraine, moscow has been keen to float proposals that would help soften export bans that have hit russians  living standards.   i find president putin s proposal to send u.n. troops to protect osce observers interesting,  she told the funke newspaper group on friday.  a few days ago i discussed with him that the u.n. troops must have access to everywhere where the osce is stationed, so the entire donetsk/luhansk region.  the conflict between ukrainian forces and russian backed separatists has claimed more than 10,000 lives since it erupted in 2014. russia denies western accusations it fomented the conflict and provided arms and fighters. the observers are there to monitor implementation of a peace deal agreed in minsk in 2015, which has been largely unsuccessful in settling the conflict despite german and french urgings. some german politicians have said sanctions should be lifted if the peace deal is implemented. christian lindner, leader of the free democrats, a likely coalition partner for merkel after sept. 24 elections, even suggested germany must accept russia s occupation of ukraine s crimean peninsula. merkel said putin s proposals were  tender shoots  of progress,  which give no cause for softening sanctions  so far. she rejected lindner s proposal.  the annexation is against international law and must not be accepted,  she said.

" when omar mateen entered an orlando, florida, nightclub on sunday to carry out the deadliest mass shooting in u.s. history, he wielded a weapon that has been used in massacres from california to connecticut: a military inspired semi automatic rifle. though so called assault rifles account for a small fraction of the united states’ 30,000 annual gun deaths, they have been used in at least 10 mass shootings since 2011, according to a database compiled by mother jones magazine. the prevalence of these firearms has made them a focal point in the debate over u.s. gun laws as opponents say civilians should not own what they describe as “weapons of war.” backers say they are simply modern rifles enjoyed by millions of law abiding americans. in december 2012, adam lanza used a bushmaster xm15 to kill 28 children and adults at the sandy hook elementary school in connecticut before taking his own life with a glock pistol. tashfeen malik and syed farook used two assault rifles and two pistols to kill 14 people in san bernardino, california, in december 2015.  james holmes carried an assault rifle, a shotgun and two pistols when he killed 12 people in a colorado movie theater in 2012. law enforcement officials say mateen, a 29 year old u.s. citizen who was the son of afghan immigrants, carried an ar 15 style assault rifle and a handgun when he killed 50 people and wounded 53 at a gay nightclub in orlando. he also had an unidentified device, said orlando police chief john mina. the ar 15 was developed from the u.s. military’s m 16 rifle, used in the vietnam war in the 1960s. unlike the military version, the ar 15 is not fully automatic, meaning users must pull the trigger each time they want to fire a shot. like the military version, many ar 15s combine light weight with a relatively modest recoil. prominent manufacturers include smith & wesson, sturm ruger and remington arms co, which faces a lawsuit from some families of sandy hook victims who say the rifle should not be sold to civilians. “it is the gold standard for killing the enemy in battle, just as it has become the gold standard for mass murder of innocent civilians,” said josh koskoff, a lawyer involved in the case.   the national shooting sports foundation, which represents gun manufacturers, said it would not comment on the orlando shooting until more facts are known.  the nssf estimates there are roughly 5 million to 10 million ar 15 rifles owned in the united states, a fraction of the 300 million firearms owned by americans. most owners say they use the rifle for target shooting and home defense, although they can be used for hunting as well. despite their controversial reputation, assault rifles do not often turn up at murder scenes. handguns accounted for at least 48 percent of all murders between 2010 and 2014, according to fbi data, while rifles   a category that includes more traditional types of long guns   accounted for 2.4 percent. roughly four times as many people were killed by knives in that period. still, in the wake of the orlando shooting several democratic politicians said congress should renew a ban on assault style weapons and large capacity ammunition magazines that was in place between 1994 and 2004. “it reminds us once more that weapons of war have no place on our streets,” said presumptive democratic presidential nominee hillary clinton. research is mixed on whether the assault rifle ban had a significant impact. gun manufacturers were able to tweak their designs to get around the ban and crime rates have fallen steadily since the early 1990s, whether or not the ban was in place. the number of mass shootings has increased since it expired.  any effort to renew the ban would face fierce opposition in the u.s. congress, where republicans who control both chambers of congress have staunchly opposed tighter gun laws and groups like the national rifle association have been able to mobilize millions of gun owners against other restrictions. despite strong support from president barack obama, the last attempt at new gun legislation failed in the u.s. senate in 2013. opinion polls find that americans are less enthusiastic about banning assault weapons than other types of gun restrictions, such as expanded background checks. several polls since 2013 have found between 44 percent and 57 percent of americans back the idea. six states and the district of columbia currently ban assault weapons and two more, minnesota and virginia, ban possession by people under 18 years old. experts say it is difficult to tell whether those laws have had an impact since gun buyers can easily find those weapons in other states.

" brent scowcroft, who was national security adviser to two republican u.s. presidents, on wednesday endorsed democrat hillary clinton for president over donald trump, in a snub of the republican party’s likely nominee by a prominent member of its security wing. “the presidency requires the judgment and the knowledge to make tough calls under pressure,” the republican elder statesman said in a statement. “i believe hillary clinton has the wisdom and experience to lead our country at this critical time.” scowcroft, 91, served as national security adviser under presidents gerald ford and george h. w. bush. ford was president from 1974 to 1977 and bush from 1989 to 1993. he joined a number of well known republicans defecting due to the prospect of a trump presidency, including richard armitage, deputy secretary of state under president george w. bush.  armitage gave clinton, 68, who was secretary of state under democratic president barack obama, his backing last week. trump “doesn’t appear to be a republican, he doesn’t appear to want to learn about issues. so, i’m going to vote for mrs. clinton,” armitage told politico at the time.  the trump campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment on scowcroft’s endorsement of clinton. trump, 70, who has never held elected office, often boasts on the campaign trail his relative newness to politics, appealing to voters disillusioned by the current political climate.  despite that facet of his appeal   which helped trump beat 16 rivals in the campaign’s primary phase to become his party’s presumptive nominee   establishment republicans worry that his inexperience and brash style will alienate foreign allies and other international partners. among his proposals, trump has criticized nato, a cornerstone of u.s. security policy, and said he would consider letting japan and south korea develop their own nuclear weapons instead of relying on the united states for protection against north korea and china. “secretary clinton shares my belief that america must remain the world’s indispensable leader,” scowcroft said. “she understands that our leadership and engagement beyond our borders makes the world, and therefore the united states, more secure and prosperous.” trump has said he would strengthen national security, but has offered few details about his plans, other than his proposals to build a wall at the u.s. mexican border and for a temporary ban on muslims entering the united states.  many national security experts have expressed alarm over the proposed ban and have warned that trump’s fiery rhetoric on the campaign trail is fueling extremism.

" a group of opposition appointed venezuelan judges arrived on thursday in chile as exiles after more than two months holed up at the chilean ambassador s residence in caracas to avoid arrest in the crisis hit country. chile s foreign ministry had granted the five parallel magistrates asylum in august. threatened with jail by venezuelan president nicolas maduro, they remained in venezuela until last week, when they said they fled the country.  four of the five resurfaced in santiago on thursday morning. another is expected to arrive later in the day.  all we can say today is that we were forced to abandon our beloved home of venezuela, but that another nation has embraced us, and will protect our freedom,  beatriz ruiz, one of the five, told reporters at santiago airport. ruiz is one of 33 unofficial magistrates who were threatened with jail by maduro after the opposition led national assembly appointed them in july to challenge the country s supreme court, which has heavily favored the ruling socialist party. maduro and the supreme court, however, contend that the designation of the opposition magistrates was illegal.  the status of the remaining unofficial magistrates remains unclear. three were detained, although local media reported they were subsequently freed. others have fled to the united states and colombia. chile is among 12 countries in the americas that form the so called lima group that criticized venezuela s entirely pro government 545 member legislative superbody, known as the constituent assembly, elected in july. the lima group this week criticized a nationwide election held in venezuela on sunday, when the ruling socialist party took 18 of 23 governorships in a nationwide vote despite widespread anger over economic hardship, that has left millions suffering food shortages, a currency collapse and soaring inflation.

" iran on sunday criticized french president emmanuel macron over his tough stance toward tehran and said paris would soon lose its international credibility if it  blindly follows  u.s. president donald trump. tensions between iran and france have risen in recent months after macron said tehran should be less aggressive in the middle east, citing in particular its involvement in syria s civil war. macron, unlike trump, has reaffirmed his country s commitment to the deal iran signed in 2015 with world powers under which it curbed its disputed nuclear program in exchange for the lifting of most international sanctions. however, he has been critical of iran s ballistic missile tests and wants to raise the possibility of new sanctions over the program, which tehran calls solely defensive in nature.  to sustain its international credibility, france should not blindly follow the americans ... the french president is now acting as trump s lapdog,  ali akbar velayati, the top adviser to iranian supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei, was quoted as saying by the semi official fars news agency. velayati also criticized u.s. ambassador to the united nations nikki haley, who last week presented pieces of what she said were parts of an iranian missile supplied to the tehran aligned houthi militia in yemen. she described the objects as conclusive evidence that tehran was violating u.n. resolutions.  this claim shows she lacks basic scientific knowledge and decency. she is like her boss (trump) as he also says baseless, ridiculous things. iran has not supplied yemen with any missile,  velayati said. tasnim news agency quoted the spokesman for iran s elite revolutionary guards, ramezan sharif, as saying on sunday that  they show a cylinder and say iran s fingerprints are all over it, while everyone knows that yemen acquired some missile capabilities from the soviet union and north korea in the past . france took a cautious stance on haley s report.  the united nations secretariat has not, at this stage, drawn any conclusions. france continues to examine the information at its disposal,  foreign ministry deputy spokesman alexandre giorgini said on friday. saudi arabia, who has long accused iran of smuggling missiles to the houthis and has intervened against them in yemen s war to try to restore its internationally recognized government, welcomed haley s report. iran has one of the middle east s biggest missile programs and some of its precision guided missiles have the range to strike its arch regional enemy israel. israel has also called for world powers to take punitive steps against iran over its missile ambitions. an israeli cabinet minister said last month that israel has had covert contacts with saudi arabia amid common concerns over iran. velayati said on sunday that reported meetings between saudi and israeli officials were no threat to iran as both countries were  weak and insignificant.  last month, the revolutionary guards warned europe that if it threatens tehran, the guards will increase the range of missiles to above 2,000 kilometers (1,240 miles).

" representative mike pompeo, president elect donald trump’s surprise choice to head the cia, supports the u.s. government’s sweeping collection of americans’ communications data and wants to scrap the nuclear deal with iran. the retired army officer, west point and harvard law school graduate also has defended the cia’s use of interrogation techniques that are widely condemned as torture. the kansas republican has criticized democratic presidential candidate hillary clinton’s use of a private email server as secretary of state and her handling of the 2012 attacks on u.s. posts in benghazi, libya. a member of the house of representatives intelligence committee, pompeo, 52, was first elected in the 2010 tea party wave from the congressional district centered on his hometown of wichita. members of both parties regard him as intelligent, collegial and capable, with a keen grasp of national security issues. “mike is very bright and hard working, and will devote himself to helping the agency develop the best possible intelligence for policy makers,” said adam schiff, the top democrat on the house intelligence committee. “while we have had our share of strong differences   principally on the politicization of the tragedy in benghazi   i know that he is someone who is willing to listen and engage.”  pompeo “is a serious guy who studies issues carefully,” said former national security agency and cia director michael hayden. some civil liberties and human rights advocates, however, expressed concern over pompeo’s selection because he opposes  closing the guantanamo bay detention center. they also criticized his support for the national security agency’s now defunct bulk communications metadata collection and other surveillance programs. “these positions and others merit serious public scrutiny through a confirmation process,” said anthony romero, the executive director of the american civil liberties union. in a january op ed in the wall street journal he co authored, pompeo called for a “fundamental upgrade to america’s surveillance capabilities,” including resuming bulk collection of domestic phone metadata, the numbers and time stamps of calls, but not their content.  the program, which a federal appeals court and two governmental review panels found to be illegal and ineffective, should be expanded to include “publicly available financial and lifestyle information into a comprehensive, searchable database”, and that “legal and bureaucratic impediments to surveillance should be removed,” he wrote. he also called for the death penalty for edward snowden, the nsa contractor who disclosed the existence of the metadata program and other top secret surveillance programs.    pompeo stands a good chance of being confirmed by the republican controlled senate. announcement of his nomination was warmly greeted by senator richard burr, the chairman of the senate intelligence committee, which will conduct his confirmation hearing.  pompeo has been at the forefront of attacks in congress on clinton, accusing her of “criminality” for storing emails containing classified information on her private server. he served on the republican led house committee that investigated the attacks by islamist extremists on u.s. diplomatic and cia posts in benghazi that killed four americans. while the panel found no wrongdoing by the administration, pompeo and another member appended to the final report a commentary accusing clinton and other officials of failing to protect the posts and to respond appropriately to the attacks.     democrats accused pompeo of using inaccurate information to exaggerate alleged failures by clinton on benghazi.some of pompeo’s positions also are at odds with the assessments of the intelligence officers and analysts trump wants him to command. while he has argued that the cia’s use of harsh interrogation techniques, including waterboarding, which simulates drowning, produced useful intelligence, current cia director john brennan has said he would resign if he were ordered to resume the practice. other cia and military officers and fbi agents have said so called “enhanced interrogation techniques” do not produce reliable information because prisoners will “say anything” to end their suffering, as one cia official put it. pompeo also is at odds with the intelligence community’s assessment of the 2015 deal that lifted financial sanctions from iran in return for limits on its nuclear program. he has vowed to overturn the deal, and suggested in a 2014 roundtable with journalists that the united states should bomb iran’s nuclear facilities, a proposal that u.s. intelligence experts said would only delay tehran’s development of a warhead, not halt it. pompeo also has opposed the regulation of greenhouse gas emissions to combat climate change, while at the cia, a recently created mission center for global issues tracks global warming as a threat to u.s. security. he has taken positions that are at odds with trump’s, notably on russia’s actions in ukraine and its military support for syrian president bashar al assad, who also is supported by iran. russia has established a toehold in the middle east, and “we now have the iranian russian axis there largely running free,” pompeo told a security forum in 2015. pompeo, who was born in california, graduated first in his class from the u.s. military academy at west point and was an artillery officer in the army for five years. he received a degree from the harvard law school and was an editor of the prestigious harvard law review.

" illinois’ governor on wednesday proposed boosting the shrinking ranks of the illinois state police in an effort to quell a steady increase in gun violence spilling over from chicago’s neighborhoods onto the city’s expressways.  bruce rauner’s proposed budget would add a projected 170 troopers through two cadet classes, one this year and another during the 2019 fiscal year. seventy of these troopers would be sent to the chicago area.      “those officers will allow us to send more patrols to the chicago area, to the expressways to counter the violence that has spilled over onto the highways there,” the republican governor told lawmakers in his springfield budget address.  the number of illinois state police troopers has declined significantly since 2008 when there were 2,105 sworn officers, according to state police data. that number dropped by more than 400 troopers to 1,671 as of last year. rauner took office in 2015.  feuding between rauner and democrats who control the legislature has kept illinois without a full operating budget since july 2015, which has meant no cadet hires for the state police in 2015 and 2016. a six month fiscal 2017 budget expired on dec. 31. at the same time, the number of shootings on chicago area expressways has consistently increased, with law enforcement placing the blame on increased gang activity.  there were just nine chicago area expressway shootings in 2011 and 2012. shooting incidents jumped to 19 in 2014 from 16 in 2013. the number nearly doubled to 37 in 2015 and rose again to 47 in 2016.  three of last year’s shootings were fatal.   there have been two confirmed shootings on the expressways so far this year and six others that are unconfirmed, illinois state police spokesman jason bradley said by email.  the violence in 2016 came as part of a broader surge in violence across chicago, the nation’s third most populous city.   with the additions to police numbers, there will be an increase in overall state police headcount of about 140 to an estimated 2,651 for the 2018 fiscal year from an estimated 2,511 for fiscal 2017.  the cost of the two classes for the 2018 fiscal year will be $10.5 million, the proposed budget said. the annualized cost of the new officers, including salaries and benefits, will be $20 million.

" the kremlin described as “complete nonsense” on tuesday media reports that u.s. president donald trump had disclosed classified intelligence during a meeting with russian officials. “it’s not a subject for us, it’s the latest piece of nonsense. we don’t want to have anything do to with this nonsense. it’s complete nonsense, not a subject to be denied or confirmed,” kremlin spokesman dmitry peskov said on a conference call with reporters.  two u.s. officials said on monday that trump had disclosed highly classified information to russia’s foreign minister about a planned islamic state operation, plunging the white house into another controversy just months into trump’s short tenure in office.

" armed militants killed at least 30 policemen in a shootout during a raid on a suspected militant hideout in egypt s western desert, security sources said on friday. a number of suspected militants were also killed and security forces are combing the area, a statement by the interior ministry said. egypt is facing an islamist insurgency concentrated in the sinai peninsula from two main groups, including an islamic state affiliate, that has killed hundreds of security forces since 2013. islamist militants have launched several major attacks, most recently targeting churches in cairo and other cities with the loss of dozens of lives. the security sources said authorities were following a lead to a hideout deep in the desert thought to house eight suspected members of hasm, a group which has claimed several attacks around the capital targeting judges and police since last year. a convoy of four suvs and one interior ministry vehicle was ambushed from higher ground by militants firing rocket propelled grenades and detonating explosive devices, a senior source in the giza security office said. the number of dead was expected to rise, two security sources said. two security sources said eight security personnel were injured in the clashes, while another source said that four of the injured were police and four others suspected militants. egypt accuses hasm of being the militant wing of the muslim brotherhood, an islamist group it outlawed in 2013. the muslim brotherhood denies this. the islamist insurgency in the sinai peninsula has grown since the military overthrew president mohamed mursi of the muslim brotherhood in mid 2013 following mass protests against his rule. the militant group staging the insurgency pledged allegiance to islamic state in 2014. it is blamed for the killing of hundreds of soldiers and policemen and has started to target other areas, including egypt s christian copts. (this version of the story was refiled to say  policemen  in first paragraph from  police officers  as the rank of the dead was not immediately known) ",0
" some tourists are having second thoughts about visiting the tropical indonesian resort island of bali after repeated warnings that its highest volcano could erupt at any time, half a century after it killed more than 1,000 people. strong volcanic tremors rumbling underground and billowing white smoke over the scenic mount agung have raised alarm, prompting the evacuation of more than 75,000 people within 12 km (7.5 miles). sitting on the so called pacific ring of fire, indonesia has nearly 130 active volcanoes, more than any other country. many indonesians live near volcanoes because lava flows make the surrounding soil and land fertile for farming.    several countries, including australia, singapore, and the united states, have issued travel advisories alerting holidaymakers to the new risk. and a hotel operator in bali said news of the volcano had caused cancellations.   business is getting low since mount agung s alert status was raised to the highest level,  said ketut purnawata, manager of dasawana resort, which is in the same district as the volcano, popular with tourists and hikers. nearly five million people visited bali last year   most of them from australia, china and japan. airlines in australia and singapore said they were preparing for any disruptions due to an eruption, but flights were running normally for now. virgin australia and jetstar, both of which fly to bali from australia, said they would carry extra fuel in case they needed to change course.  jetstar and singapore based budget carrier scoot said they had been contacted by a small number of customers looking to change their travel dates.  less than 100 customers chose to rebook to a later date,  a scoot spokeswoman said. singapore airlines and its short haul arm silkair said customers traveling to bali until oct. 2 could rebook or request a refund, while airasia said flights were operating normally. one indonesian travel agency said it had seen some cancellations.  there will definitely be an impact on (sales of) tour packages but we don t know the figures yet,  said agustinus pake seko of pt bayu buana travel agency.     president joko widodo visited shelters near mount agung on tuesday and urged residents to follow evacuation procedures after reports that some people were reluctant to leave their homes because nothing had happened.  while the government will continue to try to minimize the economic losses of the community, the most important priority is the safety of the people here,  widodo told reporters.  so i ask all people around mount agung to follow instructions from the officials and minimize the impact of this volcano.  life was going along largely as normal on the island famous for its beaches, temples and gentle hindu culture.  one spanish tourist, jordi portalo, 23, said he wasn t troubled.  i think it could happen but...maybe we d have to stay here a couple more days, so nothing to worry about,  he said sitting at a cafe next to the trademark white surfing beach of nusa dua. the last time mount agung erupted was in 1963, before tourism took off, when streams of lava traveled as far as 7 km along its slopes, killing more than 1,000 villagers. more recent ash clouds from volcanic eruptions have also disrupted tourism in bali and other parts of indonesia. hundreds of domestic and international flights were disrupted in 2016 when a volcano erupted on bali s neighboring lombok island, sending columns of ash and debris into the air.

" u.s. republican congressional leaders have refused democrats’ calls for a special prosecutor or select committee to investigate possible links between president donald trump’s campaign and russia, saying investigations by congressional committees are sufficient. u.s. intelligence agencies said in january that russian president vladimir putin had ordered hacks of the democratic national committee’s and hillary clinton’s campaign chairman’s computers to influence the election on trump’s behalf. russia has denied this. three u.s. agencies   the cia, national security agency and federal bureau of investigation   as well as the justice department, launched investigations into the matter under democratic president barack obama. in addition, here are some of the ways that congressional committees are looking into the matter: house intelligence committee   the house permanent select committee on intelligence began its investigation of potential russian influence on the 2016 presidential race before trump took office on jan. 20. the panel’s chairman, republican representative devin nunes, played a leading role in trump’s transition, which prompted some critics to question whether he was too close to the republican president to conduct a fair investigation. some of nunes’ statements contributed to their concerns, including his confirmation that he had spoken to journalists at the white house’s request to dispute reports that trump’s campaign had contact with russia.  nunes has also said he does not want the investigation to turn into a “witch hunt” like the 1950s mccarthy congressional hearings into some americans’ alleged links with communism. the committee members had to push for full access to information collected by the cia, fbi and other agencies, but more recently they have said their access has improved. the panel will hold its first public hearing on the matter on march 20. fbi director james comey and the leaders or former leaders of most of the major u.s. intelligence agencies have been invited to testify. representative adam schiff, the top democrat on the committee, said he does not know yet whether the panel is capable of conducting a credible investigation. senate intelligence committee   the u.s. senate select committee on intelligence is conducting its own investigation. also started before trump took office, it is considered the most robust congressional action. its chairman, richard burr, was re elected in november in the republican sweep that carried trump into office and preserved republican control of congress. although he was a trump supporter during the campaign, he is not as closely linked with the president as nunes is. but he also made calls to reporters as the white house tried to dispute allegations about campaign contacts with russia. senator mark warner, the committee’s democratic vice chairman, said he had “grave concerns” about the independence of the committee’s probe after the report that burr had helped the white house dispute the stories. burr and warner have expressed fewer concerns than members of the house committee about the amount of information that intelligence agencies have provided to them.         the senate intelligence committee will hold an open hearing on russian efforts to influence campaigns more generally, on march 30. the witness list includes experts, not current trump administration or intelligence community officials. senate judiciary committee   republican senator lindsey graham, chairman of the panel’s subcommittee on crime and terrorism, and sheldon whitehouse, its ranking democrat, announced that they, too, would investigate russian attempts to influence the election. they also have asked the fbi and the justice department to produce any information that supports trump’s unsubstantiated claim that his predecessor wiretapped him during the 2016 campaign. the full judiciary committee is also investigating. its chairman, chuck grassley, and top democrat, dianne feinstein, have had officials brief panel members. grassley and feinstein also sent a joint letter to comey asking for a briefing and transcripts and documents of calls between michael flynn, trump’s former national security adviser, and russian ambassador sergei kislyak. house judiciary committee   committee democrats tried to force the committee to ask the department of justice to produce records of its investigation into whether trump or his campaign had ties to russia, but panel republicans blocked the effort. the committee’s chairman, representative bob goodlatte, said instead that he would urge the government to continue its investigation. however, goodlatte said he had asked the justice department to brief the committee, and had not had a response. house oversight committee   jason chaffetz, the committee’s republican chairman, has resisted calls to investigate the trump administration. after michael flynn resigned as trump’s national security adviser because of his calls to russia’s ambassador, chaffetz said his panel would not look into the issue. he has, however, signed letters seeking related information, and he was among the first lawmakers to call for attorney general jeff sessions to recuse himself from russia related investigations because of his contacts with kislyak.

" australia s military watchdog has issued a public plea for information regarding rumors of possible war crimes committed by australian troops in afghanistan. the australian broadcasting corporation reported in july on an alleged cover up of the killing of an afghan boy as well as hundreds of pages of leaked defense force documents relating to the secretive operations of the country s special forces. on friday, the inspector general of the australian defence force released a statement saying it was conducting an inquiry  into rumors of possible breaches of the laws of armed conflict  by australian troops in afghanistan between 2005 and 2016.  the inquiry would like anyone who has information regarding possible breaches of the laws of armed conflict by australian forces in afghanistan, or rumors of them, to contact the inquiry,  the statement read.  australia is not a member of nato but is a staunch u.s. ally and has had troops in afghanistan since 2002. as recently as may, australia recommitted to the 16 year long, seemingly intractable war against the taliban and other islamist militants by sending an additional 30 troops to afghanistan to join the nato led training and assistance mission. that brought australia s total afghan deployment to 300 troops.

" libyan authorities are processing a request from britain to extradite the brother of the bomber who killed 22 people in manchester in may, but no decision has been taken yet, a government spokesman said on thursday. the armed group holding the brother said that if the attorney general s office agreed to the request, the force would be  ready for the next step . salman abedi, a 22 year old briton born to libyan parents, blew himself up at the end of a show by u.s. singer ariana grande in the deadliest militant attack in britain for 12 years. his victims included seven children. more than 500 people were injured. on wednesday, british police said they had issued an arrest warrant for his brother, hashem abedi, for murder, attempted murder and conspiracy to cause an explosion, and prosecutors had asked libya to extradite him.  an official request has been received through the libyan ministry of foreign affairs and the libyan authorities are cooperating to process (the request) in accordance with libyan legal procedures,  said hassan al houni, a spokesman for the internationally recognized government in tripoli.   no decision has been taken yet.  days after the attack, the special deterrence force (rada), a counter terrorism and anti crime group aligned with the government, arrested hashem abedi and the brothers  father ramadan. the father was released in august. various armed factions in tripoli have aligned themselves with the government, some with semi official status for law enforcement. however, the government, which struggles to impose its authority, has limited power over them. rada initially said it would not extradite hashem, but then said it was ready to cooperate.  if there is agreement between the attorney general and the british authorities, we are ready for the next step,  spokesman ahmad ben salim said. the libyan attorney general s office could not be reached for comment. islamic state said it was responsible in the immediate aftermath of the bombing but security services have always treated the claim with scepticism. in june, rada said hashem abedi had told them his brother had been radicalised in britain in 2015. they had both flown from britain to libya in april and hashem said he had helped buy the equipment necessary for the attack although he had not known that salman was planning a bombing, rada said. british police say salman abedi returned to manchester on may 18, four days before his attack. the family had emigrated to britain during the rule of the late libyan leader muammar gaddafi. the brothers  parents returned to libya during the 2011 revolution. police have previously said they believed salman abedi had built the bomb himself and cctv showed him buying nuts from a hardware store that were used as shrapnel as well as the tin that was believed to contain the explosives.

" president vladimir putin inaugurated a monument to the victims of stalinist purges on monday, but soviet era dissidents accused him of cynicism at a time when they say authorities are riding roughshod over civil freedoms.  the wall of grief  occupies a space on the edge of moscow s busy 10 lane ring road and depicts a mass of faceless victims, many of whom were sent to prison camps or executed on josef stalin s watch after falsely being accused of being  enemies of the people.  nearly 700,000 people were executed during the great terror of 1937 38, according to conservative official estimates.    an unequivocal and clear assessment of the repression will help to prevent it being repeated,  putin said at the opening ceremony.  this terrible past must not be erased from our national memory and cannot be justified by anything.  his words and the ceremony amounted to one of his strongest condemnations of the soviet union s dark side in the 18 years  he has dominated russia s political landscape.    putin has in the past called stalin  a complex figure  and said attempts to demonise him were a ploy to attack russia. but at monday s ceremony, he said there were lessons for russia.  it doesn t mean demanding accounts be settled,  said putin, who stressed a need for stability.  we must never again push society to the dangerous precipice of division.  putin s carefully balanced words reflect kremlin unease over this year s centenary of the 1917 bolshevik revolution, which paved the way for stalin s rise. uncomfortable about promoting discussion of the idea of governments being overthrown by force, the kremlin is not organizing any commemorative events. putin, who is expected to run for and win the presidency again in march, told human rights activists earlier on monday that he hoped the centenary would allow society to draw a line under the tumultuous events of 1917 and to accept russia s history    with great victories and tragic pages . yet some historians fret that what they say is putin s ambiguity about stalin along with russia s 2014 annexation of ukraine s crimea have emboldened stalin s admirers.  monuments and memorial plaques honoring stalin have sprung up in different russian regions. state approved textbooks have softened his image, and an opinion poll in june crowned him the country s most outstanding historical figure. by contrast, those who have helped document stalin s crimes, from the memorial human rights group to individual historians and journalists, have sometimes felt themselves under pressure from the authorities.  a group of soviet era dissidents published a letter on monday, accusing putin of cynicism.  we ... consider the opening in moscow of a monument to victims of political repression untimely and cynical,   they said in the letter, published on the kasparov.ru news portal.  it s impossible to take part in memorial events organized by the authorities who say they are sorry about victims of the soviet regime, but in practice continue political repression and crush civil freedoms.

" hillary clinton has distanced herself from president barack obama on a number of high profile issues since starting her bid for the white house. now, under pressure from left leaning challenger bernie sanders, she is embracing him and his legacy with fervor. that strategy could pose problems for clinton in the long run as republicans look for fodder to portray her as representing obama’s third term should she win the democratic nomination. as she faces an unexpected challenge from sanders in the early voting states, clinton’s move to portray herself as an heir to obama’s policies is aimed at courting young voters and progressives who are part of the president’s political base.  but she could be setting herself up for difficulties with a general electorate weary of the status quo. over and over again during a tense democratic presidential debate on sunday, clinton, who served as obama’s secretary of state for four years, played up her ties to the president and accused sanders of undermining him. gone were her mentions of differences with the president over syria, trade, and immigration. instead, clinton praised the affordable care act, obama’s signature healthcare law. she highlighted her connection to the administration’s iran nuclear deal and lauded the white house for sending staff to silicon valley to discuss cybersecurity. clinton, who ran against obama for the 2008 democratic nomination and then joined his administration, said she could accept sanders’ criticism of her campaign donations   one of the vermont senator’s favorite critiques   but wouldn’t tolerate similar criticism targeted at her former boss. “the comments that senator sanders has made ... don’t just affect me, i can take that, but he’s criticized president obama for taking donations from wall street. and president obama has led our country out of the great recession,” she said. “i’m going to defend president obama for taking on wall street, taking on the financial industry, and getting results.” clinton played up her service as his top diplomat, emphasized her hours advising him in the situation room, and accused sanders of wanting to throw out obamacare, all while debating in south carolina, a state in which obama is well liked. republicans welcomed the opening clinton provided for them to cast her white house run as a bid for a third obama term. “when you have a president who is so unpopular as president barack obama ... and his chief diplomat is embracing those policies and running as his third term, it’s going to be next to impossible,” said ric grenell, a former u.s. spokesman at the united nations under republican president george w. bush.  dissatisfaction with obama and the agenda in washington have helped propel two candidates outside the republican establishment   businessman donald trump and senator ted cruz of texas   to the top of the party’s crowded presidential field. trump appeared to reference clinton’s comments about the president’s policies in a speech at liberty university on monday, saying the country cannot afford another four years of the same thing. “we can’t have another four years of barack obama,” he said. “we can’t have another four years of hillary clinton.” perhaps foreshadowing future ads, the republican national committee noted that democrats at sunday’s debate had backed the current occupant of the white house. “not content with barack obama’s legacy of a toxic iran deal and the rise of isis in the middle east, democrats doubled down on the extreme and failed policies of the current administration,” the rnc said in a statement. democrats said clinton was embracing obama because he is popular with the party’s base, including in iowa, which holds the first nominating contest, called a caucus, on feb. 1. “it just makes sense to highlight where you agree with a president who is popular among caucus goers, and secretary clinton found ways to get that done,” said brent colburn, a former obama administration official who served as communications director for his 2012 campaign. democratic strategist richard socarides, a clinton supporter, said republicans were bound to portray her potential presidency as a third obama term anyway.  “she deserves a lot of credit for putting the country first and going to work for him,” socarides said. “after iowa and new hampshire especially, that will matter to a lot of democratic primary voters. and she is right to point out that bernie has not always been there. she has.”      (additional reporting by alana wise and sarah n. lynch; editing by caren bohan, mary milliken and marguerita choy) sap is the sponsor of this coverage which is independently produced by the staff of reuters news agency.",0
" a court in japan on friday ordered tokyo electric power (tepco) to pay compensation to a group of former fukushima residents, the second such ruling following the 2011 earthquake and nuclear disaster, japanese media reported. however, the ruling by the chiba district court, east of tokyo, did not find the government liable for compensation, in contrast to a march ruling in another court that ordered both the government and tepco to pay compensation to a separate group of evacuees. tepco is facing mounting legal claims over the disaster, with about 12,000 former fukushima residents filing about 30 similar class action lawsuits seeking compensation, media reports said. in the chiba case, a group of 45 residents sought damages totaling about 2.8 billion yen ($25 million) for the emotional distress of fleeing their homes as radiation spread from the meltdowns at tepco s fukushima daiichi plant after an earthquake and tsunami more than six ago. tepco was ordered to pay a total of 376 million yen ($3.36 million) for 42 of the evacuees, kyodo and jiji reported. tepco on friday said it would review the contents of the ruling before making a response. some 15,000 people died in march 2011 when three reactors at the fukushima daiichi plant suffered meltdowns after a magnitude 9 earthquake triggered a tsunami that devastated a swathe of japan s northeastern coastline. tepco has long been criticized for ignoring the threat posed by natural disasters to the fukushima plant and both the company and government were lambasted for their handling of the crisis.  in december, the government nearly doubled its projections for costs related to the disaster to 21.5 trillion yen ($192 billion), increasing pressure on tepco to step up reform and improve its performance.

" zimbabwe s top general warned on monday that the military would not hesitate to step in to end purges against former liberation war fighters in president robert mugabe s ruling party after emmerson mnangagwa was stripped of his vice president s post. general constantino chiwenga, commander of zimbabwe defence forces and a political ally of mnangagwa who was also expelled from the ruling zanu pf, said instability in the party was causing anxiety in zimbabwe. chiwenga s statement, read out at a news conference packed with army top brass, comes at a time of a deepening rift within zanu pf over who will eventually lead the party after the 93 year old mugabe goes.  mnangagwa s removal provides a boost for grace mugabe, the wife of the president, who is supported by the largely youthful g40 faction of zanu pf to succeed her husband. chiwenga said zanu pf had been hijacked by people who did not fight in the 1970s liberation war, a clear shot at g40 wing and grace mugabe who is a vocal critic of mnangagwa.       we must remind those behind the current treacherous shenanigans that, when it comes to matters of protecting our revolution, the military will not hesitate to step in,  chiwenga said in a statement read to reporters at the news conference.  the current purging ... targeting members of the party with a liberation background must stop forthwith,  he said.  mugabe s 37 years in power has been anchored by support from the military, which has always said it will not back anyone for president who did not fight in the liberation war. but the aging leader has been accusing the generals of taking sides in the succession race.  it is rare for the defense forces to publicly take sides in the affairs of zanu pf. when joice mujuru, a war veteran and mugabe s deputy of 10 years, was sacked from the ruling party in 2014, the military remained quiet. political analysts however say the military stayed quiet then because the beneficiary of mujuru s downfall was the 75 year old mnangagwa, a war veteran. grace, now poised to become a vice president, did not fight in the liberation war. the party appears split over the succession with the g40 faction supporting grace and another faction, that includes war veterans, rooting for the ousted mnangagwa. chiwenga said zanu pf had since 2015 been rocked by infighting, which had afflicted the economy, causing serious cash shortages and soaring prices of basic commodities   rare criticism of those in government by the military. analysts said if mugabe responded to chiwenga s statement, he would be compelled to choose sides between war veterans and the young turks rallying behind his wife.  he is in a corner. he has to declare his allegiance. if he condemns that statement, then he is saying therefore i am for the young turks against the war veterans,  said eldred masunugure, a political science lecturer at the university of zimbabwe.  what we are witnessing is the military saying:  we are willing to intervene if the red line is crossed . it is a warning that the political class in zanu pf is about to cross that red line.

" tax reforms in the european union, such as higher taxation of online giants, should no longer require unanimous votes from eu ministers, the head of the european commission said on wednesday, urging the use of rules that limit governments  veto powers. jean claude juncker was speaking two days before eu finance ministers meet to discuss plans to introduce higher taxes on digital multinationals like google and amazon, which stand accused of paying too little tax in europe. he urged eu states to adopt tax reforms with a  qualified majority  rather than by unanimity, a practice that has so far blocked major overhauls of tax legislation in the 28 country bloc. his proposal would end the ability of a single country to veto such decisions at ministerial level, although national leaders would retain veto power at eu summits. if taken up, the idea could reduce the power of smaller states, which offer some of the most favorable tax rates for multinationals, to block reforms. juncker said it was possible under already existing rules  to switch to majority voting in certain areas, and this should be applied to decisions on  fair taxes of the digital industry .  i want decisions in the council (of eu ministers) to be taken more often and more easily by qualified majority,  juncker said.  in separate remarks, the commissioner in charge of tax issues, pierre moscovici, said on wednesday that the eu executive will present a new  initiative  on digital taxation in the coming weeks.  the simpler decision making should also be used to decide on legislative proposals on value added tax (vat) and on a common consolidated corporate tax base, which would harmonize national rules on tax deductions, juncker said. he added that he also supported this solution for decisions on a european financial transactions tax, a long running plan from which most eu states have opted out, but which remains under discussion among 10 euro zone countries.  europe has to be able to act quicker and more decisively,  juncker said in a speech to the european parliament in strasbourg, urging the use of so called  passerelle clauses  to reduce countries  veto powers. these provisions, included in the eu treaties, allow for simplified legislative procedures if eu leaders decide so unanimously, and if national parliaments do not oppose it. eu leaders, who usually meet every three months, tend to reach overall political agreements that are later translated into legislative acts by relevant ministers.

" u.s. treasury secretary steven mnuchin cast doubt on president donald trump’s chances of cutting the corporate tax rate to 15 percent, while trump met with six senators including three democrats who set clear conditions for future cooperation with him on taxes. the president is cranking up a publicity campaign to build public support for his general goals of lower and simpler taxes, but no detailed tax plan has been completed or proposed by the white house or the republicans in control of congress. even after months of discussion within the party, basic questions are unanswered, such as whether tax cuts should be designed so they don’t add to the federal deficit and debt, and how deeply business and individual rates should be cut. mnuchin told a conference in new york hosted by cnbc on tuesday that trump, as the president has said for months, would like to cut the corporate income tax rate to 15 percent from 35 percent. then mnuchin, a top tax adviser to trump, said, “i don’t know if we’ll be able to achieve that, given the budget issues, but we’re going to get this down to a very competitive level.” later in the day, trump held a dinner at the white house with the six senators. reflecting his new willingness to engage with the political opposition, three democrats attended the dinner. in contrast, republican leaders in congress have been trying for most of the year to write a tax bill while ignoring the democrats. also attending were vice president mike pence, white house economic adviser gary cohn and mnuchin. pennsylvania republican senator pat toomey, one of the attendees, said on a conference call later that trump talked about competitive business taxes, ending taxation of u.s. corporations’ foreign profits, and a middle class tax cut. after the meal, trump took some of the senators on a tour of the west wing. later, the democrats expressed an openness to working with trump on taxes, but stressed certain conditions. west virginia democrat joe manchin said in a statement he would continue to fight for a simpler tax code, but “we must do this without adding to our staggering debt”. north dakota democrat heidi heitkamp said in a statement the dinner was a “good discussion” and that she told the president any tax package must support working families and farmers. overhauling the tax code was one of trump’s main campaign promises in 2016, but he has made little progress toward it. after nearly eight months in office, he has yet to win passage in congress of any major domestic policy legislation. besides manchin and heitkamp, others at the dinner were indiana democrat joe donnelly and three republicans: senate finance committee chairman orrin hatch and fellow tax panel republicans john thune and toomey. donnelly said in a statement, “tax reform should include measures to support companies that invest in our workers and penalize companies that ship american jobs to foreign countries.” a major concern on tax cuts is the federal budget deficit. it would balloon if tax rates were cut too deeply without providing offsetting federal spending reductions and closure of tax loopholes, both politically difficult tasks. white house budget chief mick mulvaney told fox news on tuesday that he hoped tax reform would not be revenue neutral, suggesting he is not overly concerned about the deficit and the national debt, now about $20 trillion. “we need as big and as a dramatic tax reduction and tax reform as we possibly can get,” mulvaney said. mnuchin declined to say what business tax rate was achievable. he said he was “incredibly hopeful” a tax plan could be enacted this year, adding it could be retroactive to january. asked if trump would hold out for a 15 percent corporate rate, white house spokeswoman sarah sanders said: “the president is prepared to push for as low of a rate as we can get.” republican paul ryan, the republican speaker of the house of representatives, said last week that “the numbers are hard” to make trump’s 15 percent corporate tax rate target work. ryan set his own goal at around 22.5 percent. trump’s legislative affairs director, marc short, said at a christian science monitor event, “we think that what’s best for the american people is a 15 percent corporate rate right now.” financial markets rallied after trump’s election victory last november in anticipation of rapid tax cuts, especially for corporations, but those expectations have faded. “the likelihood of passing sweeping corporate reform has diminished,” jack ablin, chief investment officer at bmo wealth management, said in a research note. democrats, who generally oppose tax cuts for the wealthiest americans, will have negotiating clout in congress in early december to resist tax changes they oppose,

" americans who had cast their votes for the next president early on tuesday appeared to be worried about the direction of the country, and were looking for a “strong leader who can take the country back from the rich and powerful,” according to an early reading from the reuters/ipsos national election day poll. the poll of more than 10,000 people who have already cast their ballots in the presidential election showed a majority of voters are worried about their ability to get ahead and have little confidence in political parties or the media to improve their situation. a majority also feel that the economy is rigged to mostly help the wealthy. the poll, which will be updated as additional responses are tallied and votes are counted throughout tuesday, found:   75 percent agree that “america needs a strong leader to take the country back from the rich and powerful.”   72 percent agree “the american economy is rigged to advantage the rich and powerful.”   68 percent agree that “traditional parties and politicians don’t care about people like me.”   76 percent believe “the mainstream media is more interested in making money than telling the truth.”   57 percent feel that “more and more, i don’t identify with what america has become.”   54 percent feel “it is increasingly hard for someone like me to get ahead in america.” the reuters/ipsos online opinion poll was conducted on election day in english in all 50 states. it includes 10,604 americans who have already cast their vote in the presidential election and has a credibility interval, a measure of accuracy, of 1 percentage point.   the poll also includes a variety of questions about the presidential race, which candidate people supported, and why. those results will be published later in the evening, after most of the votes have been counted and state races have been called.

" sweden and britain on monday requested a closed door united nations security council meeting on the  deteriorating situation  in myanmar s rakhine state, home to the majority buddhist nation s rohingya muslims, diplomats said.  the meeting would likely be held on wednesday, diplomats said.   i think it will be a private meeting but with a public outcome of some form,  british u.n. ambassador matthew rycroft told reporters on monday.   it s a sign of the significant worry that security council members have that the situation is continuing to deteriorate for many rohingya who are seeking to flee rakhine state in burma and move into bangladesh,  rycroft said.  the united nations  top human rights official slammed myanmar earlier on monday for conducting a  cruel military operation  against rohingya muslims in rakhine state, branding it  a textbook example of ethnic cleansing.   the security council discussed the situation behind closed doors on aug. 30. in a rare letter to the council earlier this month, secretary general antonio guterres expressed concern the violence could spiral into a  humanitarian catastrophe.  rights groups informally briefed security council diplomats on the myanmar violence on friday. russia and china did not send any diplomats, according to people at the meeting. myanmar has said it is was counting on china and russia to protect it from any security council censure.

" officials from so called sanctuary cities met in new york on tuesday to discuss their response to threats from the trump administration to cut off some funding to cities and states that fail to assist federal authorities in arresting illegal immigrants. attorney general jeff sessions threatened on monday to strip u.s. justice department grants from cities and other local governments that choose to shield illegal immigrants from  deportation efforts under president donald trump. his remarks were aimed at dozens of cities and other local governments, including new york, los angeles and chicago, that have joined a growing “sanctuary” movement aimed at protecting immigrant communities. tuesday’s meeting in new york marked the second straight day of brainstorming on the immigration issue by leaders of some of america’s biggest urban centers. public officials, liberal activists and academics from around the country shared information on a host of issues. topics discussed included when and how to challenge requests from immigration and customs enforcement (ice) to hold illegal immigrants under arrest, for separate local offenses. attendees came from california, texas, wisconsin, pennsylvania, connecticut, washington state and elsewhere. sanctuary cities in general offer safe harbor to illegal immigrants and often do not use municipal funds or resources to advance the enforcement of federal immigration laws. sanctuary city is not an official designation. federal records show the justice department doled out $1 billion to state governments and $430 million to nonprofits in 2016, but only $136 million directly to cities and counties. crime is generally lower in sanctuary counties, according to a study presented by university of california san diego assistant professor tom wong. he said the findings echoed those of law enforcement officials themselves, since they have found they are more effective when they can focus on day to day policing instead of immigration enforcement. chicago city council member carlos ramirez rosa said that although his city is a sanctuary jurisdiction, immigration agents raided a home there on monday where eight people, including three children, were sleeping. the agents shot and wounded felix torres, though he was not the person agents were seeking, ramirez rosa said.  “this guns blazing raid ... is exactly why my city should refuse to comply with ice, under all circumstances,” he said.

" the united nations is preparing to deploy 150 250 mostly nepalese guards to libya to protect its base in the capital as part of a plan to return its operations to the country, u.n. officials said on friday. backed by western governments, the u.n. is trying to heal a rift between libya s rival factions in order to stabilize the country and to tackle militant violence and people smuggling from libya s northern coast.  the mission has been based in tunis since 2014, when fighting among rival libyan brigades forced out most foreign embassy staff, but it has gradually increased its presence in libya and has been planning for months for a fuller return. the military unit would probably consist of around 150 guards, jean pierre lacroix, u.n. under secretary general for peacekeeping operations, told a news briefing in geneva. most will be nepalese.  to make sure that we protect our colleagues as they deploy in tripoli there will be a guard unit which will be basically u.n. military personnel coming from nepal,  lacroix said.  u.n. libya envoy ghassan salame told italian newspaper la stampa that  a little under 250  could be deployed in the  coming weeks . deploying the guards to the base in tripoli  will mean that around the beginning of october we can carry out a significant part of our work in libya,  said salame, who has headed the mission since june. a spokesperson for the mission said there were no plans to send u.n. peacekeepers to libya. security in tripoli and other parts of western libya is fragile, and armed groups that are largely unaccountable hold power on the ground.  most foreign embassies closed and pulled out their staff in 2014 when heavy fighting between rival factions destroyed the capital s airport. it was the worst fighting since the fall of long time leader muammar gaddafi in 2011. libya slipped into turmoil after the nato backed uprising that toppled gaddafi. a u.n. backed government set up in tripoli last year has struggled to assert its authority and is opposed by factions that control eastern libya.  in july, rival leaders pledged in paris to work toward elections in 2018 and a conditional ceasefire. salame said constitutional and electoral laws would have to be written to ensure any vote brought lasting change.  we need to be sure everyone accepts the final result,  he said.  let s not forget that presidential elections would be the first ever.  salame also expressed frustration at competing international initiatives in libya, where regional and european powers have vied for influence.   i think the proliferation of initiatives, of mediations, does not help,  he said. french foreign minister jean yves le drian said he hoped that after his country s efforts a revision of the 2015 u.n. mediated deal that created the tripoli government could be reached under salame s auspices. discussion has centered on reforming the government s leadership and power over military appointments.  it seems that efforts are converging,  le drian told reporters during a visit to moscow.

" a japanese man was arrested on tuesday after parts of a dismembered body were found in a picnic cooler in his apartment, police said, although media reports said parts of as many as nine bodies may have been discovered. police made the grisly find in the apartment in zama, a city just outside tokyo, after investigating the disappearance of a 23 year old woman earlier this month. the woman was seen on security camera footage walking with a man near the apartment, media reports said. a police spokesman said takahiro shiraishi, 27, was arrested on suspicion of abandoning a body, although it was not clear whose body it was.  some body parts were found in a picnic cooler, covered with cat litter,  the spokesman said. it was not immediately clear if the suspect had entered a plea or had legal representation.  kyodo news agency said the unidentified woman posted a message on twitter saying she was looking for somebody who would die with her. police declined to comment on media reports about how many bodies were found in the house. japanese media said there were at least nine   eight women and a man.

" two months after stepping down as barack obama’s ambassador to israel, dan shapiro sees some good in the initial peace efforts by the new administration of donald trump, even as he voices his grievances against it. “so far the approach on the israeli palestinian issue has been more cautious and more responsible than almost anything else,” shapiro told reuters.  “i can’t quite explain why on this one issue they’re closer to the norm than they’ve been on other issues.” shapiro has gained a following of thousands on his new personal twitter account, sharing insights gleaned from nearly six years in the tel aviv embassy and face to face contacts with prime minister benjamin netanyahu, and correcting misconceptions he perceives on social media about obama’s diplomacy. in the interview, he said trump has surprised him by calling for a slowdown in israeli settlement construction on occupied land palestinians seek for a state. the former envoy praised the republican president’s chief negotiator jason greenblatt for meeting a cross section of israelis and palestinians during a visit last week that has led to u.s. israeli discussions on limiting settlement building. still, shapiro cautioned, trump’s government is inconsistent and unpredictable.  “i’m not sure how comfortable the israelis should be with an administration that’s hard to read, that’s far from fully staffed, that has a very undeveloped policymaking apparatus and has very divergent voices within it,” he said. on other diplomatic fronts, shapiro said, the trump administration has been cozying up dangerously to russia, backtracking from free trade agreements and international organizations and calling into question washington’s nato obligations. when news broke earlier this week that secretary of state rex tillerson planned to skip a nato meeting, shapiro pointed on twitter to a failure to fill staff vacancies. “that’s ok, he’ll just send his dep ... i mean, that’s ok, he’ll send the underse ... i mean, that’s ok, he’ll send an assistan ... oh, never mind,” he wrote.  now an adviser at a hedge fund and a distinguished visiting fellow at israel’s institute for national security studies, shapiro took the unorthodox course of staying in israel after leaving his diplomatic post so that a daughter could finish high school exams. the decision to delay his family’s return, shapiro said in an interview with reuters, also allows him to avoid what he described as the “bleak” mood in washington following donald trump’s election as president. shapiro has avoided wading into israel’s domestic politics on twitter, saying that as a guest in the country, it would be unseemly to do so. looking back on the failures of the obama administration’s israeli palestinian peace efforts, he suggested that former secretary of state john kerry may have been too idealistic in pursuing talks that collapsed in 2014. “we might have adjusted our approach had we taken a very realistic assessment whether we had the leadership dynamics to achieve a breakthrough in negotiations,” said shapiro. the united states, he said, had been aware after efforts during obama’s first term, of the deep personal mistrust between israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu and palestinian president mahmoud abbas. “and so it’s a fair question about whether it was realistic at the beginning of the second term that with a concerted effort we could achieve an appreciably different result,” shapiro said.

" china has appointed new commanders of its army and air force in a reshuffle ahead of next month s communist party congress, as president xi jinping brings new blood into the military s top ranks amid an ambitious modernization program. china s armed forces, the world s largest, are ramping up their capabilities with new equipment like aircraft carriers and stealth fighters as the country pursues a more assertive stance in the disputed east and south china seas and seeks to project power far from home shores. the new army chief, han weiguo, is not a high profile figure but has risen rapidly, with three promotions since 2015. he was also commanding officer in charge of a military parade in inner mongolia in july overseen by xi to mark 90 years since the founding of the people s liberation army. han had previously served as head of the central theater command, a military district that includes beijing and a large swathe of central china. his new position was announced by state media on friday. the army has been less of a focus of the military modernization, with more resources poured into the air force and navy that have increasingly been carrying out drills in distant regions. the new air force chief, ding laihang, announced by the defence ministry on the same day, is also a relatively low profile figure, who ran air force operations for china s northern theater command before his promotion. new navy chief shen jinlong took up his position in january. sources with ties to the leadership say he is close to xi. all three men could be promoted to the central military commission headed by xi, which is in overall charge of the people s liberation army, when the party holds its once in five years congress in bejing next month. another promotion was announced in august, with previous army commander li zuocheng being made the new chief of the joint staff department of the people s liberation army. li has had a much higher profile, as one of the few senior military officers with combat experience, having fought vietnam in a brief border war in 1979. last year he was glowingly profiled in the official beijing daily, which described his time fighting the vietnamese, accompanied by black and white pictures of the then 26 year old in a trench and pointing to a map. it was not clear what had happened to fang fenghui, the chief of the joint staff department before li. at a news briefing on thursday, defence ministry spokesman ren guoqiang declined to comment on fang, who turns 67 next year, usually around the age at which chinese officials retire.

" puerto rico s governor met mayors from around the ravaged island on saturday after surveying damage to an earthen dam in the northwestern part of the u.s. territory that was threatening to collapse from flooding in the aftermath of hurricane maria. some 70,000 people who live downstream from the compromised dam, which has formed a lake on the rain swollen guajataca river, were under orders to evacuate, with the structure in danger of bursting at any time.  we saw directly the damage to the guajataca dam,  governor ricardo rossello said in a spanish language twitter message on saturday while reinforcing his request that people leave the area as soon as possible.  the fissure has become a significant rupture,  rossello said separately at a news conference on saturday. the u.s. national weather service said on its website the dam was still in danger of failing and triggering life threatening flash floods.   stay away or be swept away,  it warned.  meanwhile, people across the island were struggling to dig out from the devastation left by the storm, which killed at least 25 people, including at least 10 in puerto rico, as it churned across the caribbean, according to officials and media reports.  to all puerto ricans, please know we will get back up,  the governor tweeted as he met mayors in the territory to identify their most urgent needs.  together with the mayors, as one government.4puerto rico   in a development that could help the recovery effort, the port of san juan reopened, according to a twitter message from the agency that operates it, allowing ships to unload supplies. severe flooding, structural damage to homes and virtually no electric power were three of the most pressing problems facing puerto ricans, said new york governor andrew cuomo during a tour of the island.  it s a terrible immediate situation that requires assistance from the federal government   not just financial assistance,  said cuomo, whose state is home to millions of people of puerto rican descent.   it is a dangerous situation today and it s going to be a long term reconstruction issue for months,  cuomo, a democrat and potential 2020 presidential candidate, told cnn. maria, the second major hurricane to savage the caribbean this month and the most powerful storm to strike puerto rico in nearly a century, carved a path of destruction on wednesday. it knocked out electricity, apart from emergency generators, on the island of 3.4 million inhabitants. near the rain swollen guajataca river, in the northwest part of the island, floodwater littered with branches and debris engulfed the first floor of a number of homes and swamped vehicles that were left behind.  we lost our house, it was completely flooded,  said  resident carmen gloria lamb.  we lost everything, cars, clothes, everything.  the storm has resulted in 10 confirmed fatalities on the island so far, rossello s office told cnn on saturday. the governor s office could not be reached for comment by reuters. signs of the strain on puerto ricans were evident throughout san juan, the capital. drivers had to wait up to seven hours at the few filling stations open on saturday, according to news reports, and lines of cars snaked for blocks. hotels warned that guests might have to leave soon without fresh supplies of diesel to keep generators operating. water rationing also began on saturday. signs posted throughout san juan s old town informed residents that service would return for two hours each day, between 5 p.m. and 7 p.m., until further notice.  telephone service was also unreliable, with many of the island s cell towers damaged or destroyed.  people swarmed under some of the towers, holding up their devices in the hopes of getting a signal. the governor also extended a nightly curfew on saturday, the caribbean business newspaper reported. at san juan s luis munoz marin international airport, mary ann arciola, her 32 year old daughter and two young grandchildren slept in a rented van hoping to get a flight home to the united states.  there s nobody at the desks. there s nothing on the screens,  said arciola, 62.  there s a ton of people. they are starting to fight. it s not good.  maria struck puerto rico as a category 4 storm on the five step saffir simpson scale as the island was already facing the largest municipal debt crisis in u.s. history. the storm may have caused an estimated $45 billion in damage and lost economic activity across the caribbean, with at least $30 billion of that in puerto rico, said chuck watson, a disaster modeler at enki research in savannah, georgia.  elsewhere in the caribbean, 14 deaths were reported on dominica, an island nation of 71,000 inhabitants.  two people were killed in the french territory of guadeloupe and one in the u.s. virgin islands. two people died in the dominican republic on thursday, according to media outlet el jaya. maria still had sustained winds of up to 115 miles per hour (185 km per hour) on saturday, making it a category 3 hurricane, but was expected to weaken gradually over the next two days as it turned more sharply to the north. dangerous surf and rip currents driven by the storm were expected along the southeastern coast of the u.s. mainland for several days, the national hurricane center said. maria hit about two weeks after hurricane irma, one of the most powerful atlantic storms on record, killed more than 80 people in the caribbean and the united states. it followed hurricane harvey, which also killed more than 80 people when it struck texas in late august and caused flooding in houston.

"amid the tumult of the 2016 presidential campaign, john podesta is best known as hillary clinton s campaign chairman and the individual from whose private account wikileaks is presently publishing some 50,000 hacked emails.released in daily batches, these documents have laid bare the inner workings and tensions of the clinton campaign in an unprecedented way, while also offering insights into the operations of the clinton foundation and the state department in the years when clinton, now the democratic presidential nominee, served as secretary of state.at that time, when clinton was traveling to a record number of foreign countries, podesta, a former white house chief of staff under president clinton, held dual titles at the state department: as a senior advisor   entitled to an annual salary of $130,000 never paid him, the department maintains   and as a member of a prestigious foreign policy advisory board secretary clinton created. records obtained from the u.s. office of personnel management show podesta s tenure at state extended from sept. 25, 2011 to jan. 4, 2014.for several months in 2012, clinton s final year as secretary of state, raytheon, the leading defense contractor, hired podesta s sister-in-law, heather podesta, as a lobbyist, federal records show.raytheon was looking to enlarge its share of foreign military sales   transfers of advanced weapons systems to other countries that are reviewed and approved by the department of state, then implemented by the department of defense   and was beefing up its lobbying operation to accomplish that goal before secretary clinton left office.on the ld-2 lobbying disclosure form completed by her company, heather podesta + partners, llc, in july 2012, the veteran lawyer and democratic fundraiser listed in the space provided for a description of her lobbying activities,  engaged the executive branch on the economic benefits of foreign military sales.  in the space requesting the specific locales of her lobbying, ms. podesta listed the white house and the state department.at the same time, raytheon retained two other lobbyists, john merrigan and matt bernstein, both associated with the powerhouse d.c. law firm dla piper. all three of these lobbyists, including ms. podesta, were major donors or bundlers to hillary clinton s 2008 and 2016 campaigns. federal records show they have raised hundreds of thousands of dollars for clinton s campaigns and earned hundreds of thousands of dollars lobbying her state department.in the final three quarters of 2012, dla piper earned some $360,000 in lobbying fees from raytheon, courting the state department and other agencies, while ms. podesta, within that same time frame, received $100,000 from raytheon for the same purpose.the gambit appears to have worked: records maintained by the defense security cooperation agency, the arm of the defense department that coordinates the transfers of weapons systems once they have received state s approval, show raytheon as a prime contractor in at least seventeen foreign military sales in 2012, worth an estimated total of $26 billion. of those contracts, three with the gulf nation of qatar   for missile defense, apache attack helicopters and other materiel   accounted for $19 billion.read more: fox news ",1
" the philippines is preparing to declare the end of fighting in a southern city seized for five months by pro islamic state rebels, a top military commander said on saturday, as troops continued a phased withdrawal from the devastated lakeside city.   only 20 insurgents remained in a small area in marawi city, including five  significant  figures, and three battalions of troops were closing in on their positions, said lieutenant general carlito galvez.     most probably tomorrow, we can do it,  galvez told reporters when asked when the military can declare fighting is over.  we can declare it is totally complete.    galvez said troops are zeroing in on three sons of isnilon hapilon, the slain  emir  of islamic state in southeast asia, and two malaysians, including amin baco, who has been central to facilitating the movement of foreign fighters in the region.   we cannot say our mission is totally accomplished or completed if the five persons are still there,  he said, adding the remaining militants are  struggling to survive  and to protect their shrinking position.   another general told reuters they were also looking for a prominent indonesian militant. the military is concerned hapilon s sons and these foreign fighters could succeed core leaders of the alliance killed this week.    hapilon and omarkhayam maute were killed by commandoes on monday. malaysian mahmud ahmad, who experts say may have funded the marawi siege, was also dead, according to a freed hostage, but his body has yet to be found. the defense ministry said on saturday that forensic tests by the u.s. federal bureau of investigation had confirmed that the man killed was hapilon. the united states has provided technical support to treaty ally the philippines, including surveillance drones. the deaths of the leaders could slow down any effort by islamic state to establish a presence in mindanao, a vast island with a history of rebellion and home to the predominantly roman catholic nation s muslim minority.  the organization and combat capability of the rebels has stunned the military. some experts see the siege as a prelude to a more ambitious bid by islamic state loyalists to exploit mindanao s poverty and use its jungles and mountains as a base to train, recruit and launch attacks in the region. galvez, head of the western mindanao command, inspected troops in marawi and sent off a battalion of marines central to  military operations . it was the second unit to leave the conflict area.   the military declined to divulge the number of troops remaining in marawi. elite commandoes were leading the assault, with army infantry battalions and police commandoes securing safe areas.   the military said eleven hostages were  processed  on saturday to determine whether they were really captives or militant members and sympathizers trying to slip away.   galvez said rehabilitation, including retrieval of the dead, would start after the end of hostilities is declared. the philippines estimates the rebuilding of areas battered by months of government air strikes could cost at least 50 billion philippine pesos ($971 million).

" japan s government approved a record military budget on friday but did not earmark enough extra money to stop a splurge on u.s. made ballistic missile defense kit from putting a squeeze on funding for an ambitious domestic jet fighter project. japan s defense outlays for the year starting april 1 will rise for a sixth straight year, increasing by 1.3 percent to 5.19 trillion yen ($45.76 billion), according to a budget breakdown published by the government. the biggest ticket item is 137 billion yen to reinforce defenses against a possible north korean ballistic missile attack.  that includes purchases of a new longer range interceptor, the sm 3 block iia, designed to strike ballistic missiles in space, upgrades for the patriot missile batteries that are the last line of defense against incoming warheads and preparations for the construction of two ground based aegis radar stations. japan will also spend 2.2 billion yen to begin acquiring medium range air launched cruise missiles able to strike sites in north korea in a bid to deter any potential attack by pyongyang, which continues to test ballistic missiles.  it is essential that we have the latest, most capable equipment to bolster our defenses,  japanese minister of defence intsunori onodera said after he and other cabinet members approved the new spending plan.  the latest rocket launched by the north on nov. 29 reached an altitude of more than 4,000 km (2,485 miles) before plunging into the sea of japan.   a spending spree on mostly u.s. made equipment means japan s defense planners are being forced to curtail domestic programs that would help local defense contractors such as mitsubishi heavy industries and kawasaki heavy industries maintain their military industrial base. that may force japan to curtail its long held ambition to build an advanced stealth fighter, dubbed the f 3. in november, u.s. president donald trump called on prime minister shinzo abe to buy more u.s. made weapons as his administration pushes washington s allies to contribute more to their joint defense. japan plans to allocate 279 billion yen of its next budget to buy defense equipment through the u.s. government s foreign military sales system, 15 percent more than the current budget and more than double the amount spent in year that ended march 31, 2015.  people who spoke to reuters in november said japan will delay a decision to develop the f 3, which is meant to counter military technology advances by china, putting on hold a project estimated to be worth more than $40 billion. the latest defense spending plans provide the first concrete public indication that pause is underway. a budget request submitted in august earmarked 7.4 billion yen for a new large jet engine test facility that japan s defense ministry will need to test a prototype f 3 engine. that item was not included in the budget approved on friday. a proposed 2.4 billion for other f 3 research was also trimmed to 1.6 billion yen.  money is being spent in other areas and this is a sign that the government sees the f 3 as a low priority,  a japanese defense ministry official said. he asked not to be identified because he is not authorized to talk to the media.

" two prominent religious conservatives defended u.s. president donald trump on sunday after he was widely criticized for blaming both white nationalists and counter protesters for last weekend’s violence at a virginia rally organized by neo nazis and white supremacists.  evangelical christian jerry falwell jr said trump could be more polished and politically correct but is not racist. former arkansas governor mike huckabee, who last week criticized the white nationalists’ “evil, sinful, disgusting behavior,” said unequivocally on sunday that the faith community stood by trump. the responses reflect a balancing act by conservative christians as they try to square the images that emerged from the virginia city of charlottesville last weekend   torch carrying white supremacists and neo nazis toting swastika flags   with support for a president that failed to condemn them roundly and immediately. trump alienated fellow republicans, corporate leaders and u.s. allies with his comments about the violence that broke out at a white nationalist protest against the removal of a confederate statue in charlottesville. he said “many sides” were to blame and that there were “very fine people” on both sides. trump also decried the removal of civil war monuments to the confederacy that several cities have deemed offensive for their connection to slavery.  but the remarks, including those at a fiery trump news  conference on tuesday, may not dent support from his political base, where white evangelical christian voters are a major component.  many in the evangelical christian community condemned the neo nazis, ku klux klan and other white supremacists who marched in the university of virginia town before one of them plowed through a crowd of counter protesters and killed a 32 year old woman. fewer criticized trump directly.  falwell, president of the christian based liberty university in lynchburg, virginia, said trump likely had more detailed information on protesters when he described “fine people” on both sides.  “one of the reasons i supported him is because he doesn’t say what’s politically correct, he says what is in his heart,” falwell told abc’s “this week” program. “but he does not have a racist bone in his body.” national public radio reported on sunday that a number of liberty university graduates were preparing to return their diplomas to protest his support for trump. falwell said they misunderstood that support. huckabee, a conservative baptist minister before entering politics, said trump “has the faith community.” “this is an attempt to discredit and ultimately dislodge donald trump from the white house,” huckabee told fox business network. huckabee noted that only one person on a faith council that advises trump had stepped down since the controversy.  new york city megachurch pastor a.r. bernard said he left trump’s unofficial evangelical advisory board on tuesday after having distanced himself for several months as “it became obvious that there was a deepening conflict in values between myself and the administration.” johnnie moore, an evangelical adviser to the white house, said in a statement he deeply respects bernard. “we have every intention to continue to extend invitations to him to contribute his perspective on issues important to all of us,” he said. pastor mark burns, an african american televangelist who leads a small congregation in south carolina and serves on the board, said in an interview on msnbc on saturday that he stood by trump.  “i don’t believe he supported neo nazis, i don’t believe he’s supporting white supremacists at all,” burns said in an interview with msnbc on saturday. “i would have personally said stronger (things) in reference to the kkk, neo nazis, but i don’t have all the information.” franklin graham, the president and ceo of the billy graham evangelistic association, denounced bigotry and racism on his facebook page a day after the charlottesville violence, but at the same time, he also took aim at politicians who tried to connect trump to that turmoil. one member of the evangelical community, biblical studies professor denny burk of boyce college in kentucky, condemned the president’s remarks at tuesday’s news conference as “more than disappointing.” “they were morally bankrupt and completely unacceptable. people who protest while chanting nazi slogans are not ‘very fine people,’” burk wrote in an article posted on his facebook page.

" four men suspected of killing the north korean leader s half brother at a malaysian airport changed their clothes and appearance to escape detection, a police witness said on thursday.  the four, who are still at large, are charged together with two women   indonesian siti aisyah and doan thi huong from vietnam   with killing kim jong nam at kuala lumpur airport s budget terminal on feb. 13. prosecutors in the malaysian court say siti aisyah and huong conspired with the men to murder kim, by smearing his face with liquid vx, a chemical poison banned by the united nations. defense lawyers have argued the women did not know they were handling poison and thought they were involved in a prank for a reality tv show.    the men had been formerly identified only as mr. chang, mr. y, james, and hanamori, also known as grandpa  or  uncle , which a police witness has said were assumed names. the men changed clothes after the attack, before they were seen leaving the airport, police investigator wan azirul nizam che wan aziz told the court.   they were trying to confuse (observers),  wan azirul said, describing closed circuit television recordings made on the day of the killing.  more than 40 cctv video clips of the men s movements at the airport were screened in the darkened courtroom.      they showed mr. chang and mr. y heading to different bathrooms in the airport before emerging in different clothes, shortly after the attack on kim jong nam.  mr. chang, who had earlier been seen wearing a goatee, also came out of the bathroom clean shaven.  all of the suspects at large, even though they changed clothes, did not change their shoes,  added wan azirul, who said the shoes were among the features enabling identification of the suspects, besides their body types and movements.  other videos showed mr. chang and mr. y meeting separately with a man, identified as hanamori, at a restaurant near the airport s check in counters, prior to the attack. hanamori was seen arriving at the restaurant with a fourth man, who wan azirul said was suspected to be james . mr. chang later met alone with siti aisyah at the restaurant, while mr. y was seen walking past the restaurant with huong. it is unclear whether the four suspects at large were the same four north koreans authorities described as having left kuala lumpur for pyongyang on the day of the killing.  an interpol alert has been issued for the four who left, identified as north koreans ri ji hyon, hong song hac, o jong gil, and ri jae nam.      u.s. and south korean officials have said agents of kim jong un s regime masterminded the murder. the trial will resume on nov 6.

" pledges to spend on education and child care, stay tough on north korea and revise the pacifist constitution are likely to be pillars of japanese prime minister shinzo abe s campaign in a snap election next month, government sources said on tuesday. abe is expected to announce on monday that he will call a general election on oct. 22 to take advantage of a rebound in his damaged approval ratings and disarray in the opposition, ruling party and government sources said. the prime minister, whose ratings have recovered from below 30 percent in july, is betting his ruling bloc can at a minimum retain a simple majority in the chamber and at best keep the two thirds super majority needed to achieve his long held goal of revising the constitution to clarify the military s role. a solid victory would boost abe s chances of a third term as ruling liberal democratic party (ldp) leader in a party election next september, putting him on track to become japan s longest serving premier.  that is his biggest goal,  said veteran independent political analyst minoru morita.  abe s support rose 6.5 points to 50.3 percent in a poll conducted over the weekend by the sankei newspaper and the fuji news network, while backing for the ldp was at 38 percent compared to 6.4 percent for the main opposition democratic party. abe wants to go ahead with a planned rise in the nation s sales tax to 10 percent from 8 percent and use some of the revenue to create a  social security system for all generations , which would invest in education while decreasing the proportion of sales tax revenue used to pay down government debt, the sources said.  japan s social welfare system is weighted toward spending on the elderly, with people aged 65 and over accounting for a whopping 27.7 percent of the population according to the latest government data.   you can promise anything you want   make a nod toward a more equitable society, empowering women, work life balance, welfare for all generations,  said jeffrey kingston, director of asian studies at temple university japan.  he s got a strategy that is going to win.  using less tax revenue to pay down debt, however, would make more difficult an already ambitious pledge to balance the budget   excluding debt servicing and new bond sales   by the year through march 2021. that could in turn raise concerns about less rigid fiscal discipline.  we have to maintain fiscal discipline, regardless,  finance minister taro aso told reporters when asked about reports of such a shift. abe has said he will decide on a snap election after he returns from the united states on friday. the opposition democrats are struggling not only with single digit support but also a raft of defections. and while the nascent  japan first  party, which boasts ties to popular tokyo governor yuriko koike, could attract votes, it has yet to draft a platform, pick candidates or formally register as a party. that means the ldp and its junior coalition partner, the komeito, have a shot at retaining their two thirds majority in the lower house, political analysts said. however, some analysts believe abe s electoral base could be undermined by voter distaste over suspected cronyism scandals and concerns about creating a political vacuum even as north korea raises tensions with its nuclear and missile tests.  i don t dismiss the possibility of the voters giving abe a nasty surprise,  said gerry curtis, professor emeritus at columbia university in new york.

" u.s. president donald trump predicted on sunday that senator jeff flake will oppose the republican tax bill, but the senator’s office says he has not yet made up his mind. “senator flake is still reviewing the tax reform bill on its merits. how he votes on it will have nothing to do with the president,” a spokesman for the senator said in an email.  that is contrary to an assertion made by trump on sunday in a post on twitter. “he’ll be a no on tax cuts because his political career anyway is ‘toast.’,” trump wrote of flake on twitter.  where individual republican senators stand on the tax bill has become the focus of those trying to determine whether it will pass because republicans control only 52 seats in the senate.  more than two republican defections would likely kill the bill. wisconsin senator ron johnson has already publicly stated he opposes the bill in its current form. the house voted last week to approve the tax bill with no support from democrats and 13 republicans defecting. trump and flake, both republicans, have been critical of each other in recent months. flake delivered a speech on the senate floor in october during which he said trump threatened the nation’s democracy. in the same speech, flake announced he would not be seeking re election to the senate next year when his term expires.  trump has in turn been critical of flake, saying he would not be able to win re election.  on saturday at an event in arizona, flake was overheard on a nearby microphone talking with mesa mayor john giles about trump.  “if we become the party of roy moore and donald trump, we are toast,” flake said, according to television station knxv, whose microphone recorded him.  moore, who is the republican candidate for a senate seat in alabama, has faced sexual misconduct allegations, and republican leaders in congress have urged him to drop out of the dec. 12 special election.    in his twitter post on sunday, trump also suggested that flake intentionally made those remarks in order to be heard.  “sen. jeff flake(y), who is unelectable in the great state of arizona (quit race, anemic polls) was caught (purposely) on “mike” saying bad things about your favorite president,” trump wrote on twitter.

" singapore has suspended trade relations with north korea, the latest of pyongyang s major trade partners to cut commercial ties under toughening u.n. sanctions over its weapons program, a customs notice obtained on thursday showed. the move comes about two months after the united states imposed north korea related sanctions on a number of firms and individuals, including two entities based in singapore.  singapore will prohibit all commercially traded goods from, or to, the democratic people s republic of korea (dprk),  the city state s customs said in the notice sent to traders and declaring agents last tuesday, referring to the country by its official name.   the suspension would take effect from nov. 8, fauziah a. sani, head of trade strategy and security for the director general of customs, said in the notice.  repeated breach of the new prohibitions is punishable by a fine of up to s$200,000 ($147,340.50) or four times the value of the goods traded, imprisonment of up to three years, or both, it added.  singapore is north korea s seventh largest trading partner. the philippines, pyongyang s fifth biggest trading partner, suspended trade with north korea in september to comply with a u.n. resolution. tension on the korean peninsula has escalated as north korea s young leader, kim jong un, has stepped up the development of weapons in defiance of u.n. sanctions. north korea has tested a series of missiles this year, including one that flew over japan, and conducted its sixth and biggest nuclear test in september. pyongyang maintains a diplomatic presence in singapore, with an embassy in its financial district.  in september, singapore issued a travel advisory urging citizens to avoid all non essential travel to north korea, where it does not have diplomatic representation.  in an interview with national public radio in may, singapore s minister of foreign affairs, vivian balakrishnan, had said the country was not ready to cut all diplomatic ties with north korea.    in january last year, singapore based chinpo shipping company (private) ltd was fined s$180,000 for facilitating a shipment of arms to north korea in violation of u.n. sanctions.

" democratic presidential candidate and u.s. senator bernie sanders on monday rejected a bipartisan deal reached in the house of representatives on legislation to address puerto rico’s debt crisis, calling it a concession to wall street. breaking with the obama administration, sanders called on senate colleagues to instead back an alternative he has proposed to allow the u.s. territory the same access to restructure its debt in bankruptcy court that is afforded to municipalities. lawmakers in the u.s. house of representatives last week unveiled a bill, hammered out in talks between lawmakers from both parties, that included a framework for restructuring puerto rico’s $70 billion in debt and putting the island’s financial operations under the control of a federal oversight board. a house vote is expected in the first week of june, ahead of a $1.9 billion debt payment due on july 1, but any legislation would have to clear the senate as well. democratic congressional leaders have acknowledged disagreements with some parts of the bill but said negotiations had led to a workable compromise, and the obama administration has urged congress to quickly pass it. “it is critical that congress pass this as there are very significant bond payments due in july,” u.s. treasury secretary jack lew said last week. “time is of the essence.” sanders’ rival for the democratic nomination, hillary clinton, has also backed the legislation. but sanders, who represents vermont as an independent but who caucuses with democrats, said wall street would benefit at the expense of puerto rico’s workers. “this legislation looks out for the needs of wall street vulture funds first and foremost. that is unacceptable,” he wrote in a letter to senate colleagues on monday. he cited provisions exempting residents from new overtime protections and allowing minimum wage on the island to dip to $4.25 for a period of up to five years, far lower than the u.s. minimum wage of $7.25.  instead, sanders said the u.s. federal reserve and treasury department could find other solutions, such as providing loans to puerto rico’s electric authority and water agency, and directly purchasing new bonds issued by the u.s. commonwealth.

" the man answering a volunteer’s knock on the door in the kendall section of miami dade county on saturday was emphatic: not only would he vote but “esperamos que la presidenta gane”   spanish for “we hope madam president wins.” volunteers across florida made a last minute push to get voters to the polls this weekend with early voting ending on sunday ahead of election day on tuesday, pitting republican donald trump against democrat hillary clinton, or “la presidenta,” as the man at the door called her. latino voters like the man in kendall and elsewhere could have an outsized influence in tuesday’s election. early voting data may portend a jump in the number of hispanic voters this year, especially in the key swing states of nevada and florida, and clinton would likely be the biggest beneficiary. clinton has polled much stronger among latino voters nationwide: a washington post/univision poll released last week gave her 67 percent of the hispanic vote to trump’s 19 percent. trump has fared poorly with america’s largest minority voting group, having repeatedly angered hispanics with disparaging comments about their communities.  a recent poll conducted by the firms the tarrance group and bendixen and amandi found that hispanic registered voters in florida favor clinton 60 percent to 30 percent. in nevada the gap was even wider   72 percent for clinton and 19 percent for trump. in florida, the clinton campaign estimates early latino voting is up 139 percent, or more than twice as much, compared to 2012, according to a field report dated wednesday. democratic strategist steve schale, a florida expert, estimated that 170,000 more hispanics had voted early or by mail as of wednesday than had voted early or by mail in the entire 2012 election, according to a post on his blog. “and keep in mind, because hispanic is a self identifying marker, studies have found that the real hispanic vote is larger than the registration. so while hispanics might make up 14.2 percent of the voters who have voted so far, in reality, the number is larger,” he wrote. despite the surge in early voting, there is no certainty about which candidate people chose for president. there is also no guarantee that the higher latino turnout rate will continue on election day and that they and other minority voters will make enough of a difference to swing florida and other states.  trump kicked off his maverick campaign last year by describing mexican immigrants as rapists and criminals, and made a tough stance on immigration a signature part of his vision for america. he called for a wall to be built on the border and said an american born federal judge could not do his job because of his mexican heritage. that rhetoric might be hurting him in an increasingly diverse florida, where many election watchers believe trump must win to have a chance to secure the minimum 270 votes in the electoral college needed to claim the white house.  daniel smith, a political science professor at the university of florida who also does voting research, said democrats have a strong lead among hispanics who have voted early in florida.  “from my perspective this is hispanics in florida reacting viscerally to donald trump,” said smith. “his scorched earth campaign against immigrants and especially hispanics is coming home to roost in florida.” the state of nevada does not note race or ethnicity on its voter registration but other data there suggest latinos also are turning out in force. for one thing, clark county has seen a surge in early voting. between in person and absentee voting, registered democrats have now returned over 72,000 more ballots than registered republicans there. those figures do not indicate which candidate voters picked, only the party with which the voters are registered. friday alone saw 57,172 votes in person in clark county. photos making the rounds on social media showed especially long lines at a cardenas market voting site, which stayed open late to accommodate the surge of voters. clark county, which includes las vegas, has a large latino population – 30.6 percent, compared to 28.1 percent for nevada as a whole, according to the u.s. census. even more republican votes elsewhere in the state are so far not enough to counterbalance that democratic lead in clark county. overall, the democrats have cast around 46,000 more ballots in nevada than republicans. that’s not an accident, said artie blanco, the nevada state coordinator for the progressive group for our future. her organization and others banded together in a major get out the vote push, especially among voters of color, and the coalition’s data suggest that the effort paid off. twenty two percent of democrats who voted on friday had a conversation with someone from that progressive coalition at some point after oct. 15, blanco said. among latino voters on the last three voting days, the coalition had conversations with 14 percent of them after oct. 15, according to the group’s data. trump on saturday took a jab at the early voting turnout in nevada. “they didn’t get the kind of vote that they needed to stop us on tuesday,” trump said in reno. “tuesday is our day in this state.” he said reno and northern nevada could “carry us all the way to washington.”  but blanco said the votes were instead the result of major work to bring out voters, especially people of color and that progressive organizations were not done yet. “we have all these voters that we need to now go back and say, ‘you’ve got one day,’” she said of those who had not yet cast ballots.

" a donald trump presidency would be bad for corporate dealmaking, according to a global survey of people who advise companies on mergers and acquisitions, or m&a. nearly two thirds of 1,500 respondents   including investment bankers, lawyers and people who work for private equity firms   said a trump presidency would create uncertainty that would deter executives from launching bids. the survey was conducted in april by intralinks holdings inc il.n, which provides confidential meeting rooms used by companies when they allow would be bidders to look through their accounts. “the real story is that dealmakers crave less disruption, and trump has been a polarizing figure on a global scale,” matt porzio, vice president of strategy at intralinks, said in a phone interview on wednesday. trump is the front runner for the republican nomination for the nov. 8 election. his unpredictable style and fiery rhetoric have some investors worried that as president he could trigger trade wars, hurt the economy and add a lot of volatility to financial markets. the new york real estate developer prides himself on his ability to make good deals, and m&a professionals in the united states were less concerned about his impact on business than their peers elsewhere. according to the survey, 46 percent of u.s. dealmakers said they believed trump would have a negative impact on m&a activity, compared with 83 percent of dealmakers in latin america. trump has sparked controversy with his call for building a wall along the mexican border and for deporting 11 million illegal immigrants from the united states. some 71 percent of dealmakers based in europe and 75 percent in asia thought trump would be bad for business. globally, only 45 percent of respondents thought that u.s. senator bernie sanders of vermont, a self described socialist who is competing with hillary clinton for the democratic nomination, would be bad for m&a activity. but the same proportion   45 percent   thought clinton would have a positive impact on mergers and acquisitions, making her the candidate viewed to have the highest positive impact on corporate tie ups.

" support for new zealand s opposition labour party was neck and neck with the national party, a poll showed, threatening the center right government s decade long grip on power.  backing for labour had surged 7 points to 39.5 percent, virtually even with national on 40 percent, a roy morgan poll showed on friday.  the result highlights the unusually tight race to the vote on sept. 23, with surveys by separate pollsters this week showing both national and labour in the lead.  the narrow gap between the major parties means the final outcome of the election will be decided by the second string parties   and it is here that labour has a decisive edge,  gary morgan, the pollster s executive chair, said on its website. labour s possible coalition partner, the green party, posted support of 9 percent, putting the pair in a strong position to form a government with the smaller m ori party, whose support was 2 percent. the nationalist new zealand first party dropped 2.75 points to just 6 percent, making it less likely that labour would need the populist party to form a government.

" u.s. president donald trump will likely face questions about  his executive order restricting some travel to the united states when he meets with the ceos of major u.s. companies at the white house on friday. companies whose chief executives are expected to attend the meeting of the president’s business advisory panel include jpmorgan chase & co (jpm.n), general motors co (gm.n), blackstone group lp (bx.n), ibm corp (ibm.n), uber technologies inc [uber.ul] and walt disney co (dis.n), two officials briefed on the meeting said on wednesday. activists are already pressuring the ceos to raise concerns about the travel restrictions at the meeting, which comes at the end of another turbulent week for the trump administration. trump’s order last friday, barring travel into the united states by people from seven muslim majority countries, touched off public protests and stirred unease among employees at many big u.s. companies. ceos have been faced with difficult choices to either criticize trump’s move at a time when they are trying to win white house support on tax and trade policies, or remain silent and take heat from consumers and employees dismayed by the order. the trump administration says the travel ban is aimed at strengthening national security. backlash over the measure knocked the wind out of the post inaugural stock market rally, although major indexes rebounded on wednesday.  trump’s executive order put a 120 day halt on the u.s. refugee program, barred syrian refugees indefinitely and imposed a 90 day suspension on people from iran, iraq, libya, somalia, sudan, syria and yemen. along with protests it has prompted legal challenges in the united states and drawn criticism from several leading u.s. companies. among those critics, uber ceo travis kalanick wrote in an email to employees saturday that “the ban will impact many innocent people — an issue that i will raise this coming friday when i go to washington for president trump’s first business advisory group meeting.” trump will kick off the two hour meeting with an address lasting 10 15 minutes and will be followed by stephen schwarzman, the billionaire founder of private equity group blackstone (bx.n), who chairs the panel and assembled it at  trump’s request. four topics will be discussed —  regulatory relief, women in the work force, tax and trade, and infrastructure — with two to three people talking briefly about each subject to help shape  “how the administration should be thinking,” according to a person familiar with the matter. investors said the ceos would be mindful of trump’s penchant for rebuking companies publicly.  “given recent history, being called out publicly is something that the ceos in that room and other ceos will absolutely be mindful to avoid,” said jim russell, vice president at bahl & gaynor inc, which oversees $17 billion and owns shares in several of the companies attending friday’s meeting. “i’m sure they will pick their fights carefully and articulate them carefully.” it was not clear if all 19 members of the president’s strategic and policy forum would attend friday’s meeting. other members include the ceos of tesla inc (tsla.o), wal mart stores inc (wmt.n) and boeing co (ba.n). tesla founder elon musk said this week that the travel order should be modified and he would seek a consensus among members of the advisory council. ford motor co (f.n) executive chairman bill ford jr. and ceo mark fields have also criticized the travel measure. gm has declined to take a position. on wednesday, a group of religious investors, human rights groups other activists urged members of the business advisory panel to speak out against the travel restrictions at the meeting with trump. in a joint letter to the corporate leaders, the group said trump’s order “undermines respect for human rights and the lives of workers and their families in the u.s. and beyond, and disrupts economic activity  and company operations.”  the letter was signed by dozens of people, including representatives of firms focused on socially responsible investing like calvert research and management and domini impact investments. others included representatives of the international corporate accountability roundtable, the institute for human rights and business and the interfaith center on corporate responsibility. companies that have been most critical of trump’s immigration orders include netflix inc (nflx.o), apple inc (aapl.o), and amazon.com inc (amzn.o), none of which form part of the business advisory panel.

" u.s. transportation secretary elaine chao said the trump administration would unveil a $1 trillion infrastructure plan later this year, but she did not offer details of funding for projects. chao said at an event at the department’s headquarters that the infrastructure initiative would include “a strategic, targeted program of investment valued at $1 trillion over 10 years. the proposal will cover more than transportation infrastructure, it will include energy, water and potentially broadband and veterans hospitals as well.” chao’s comments were the most detailed timetable from the administration about its plans to unveil a plan to modernize u.s. roads, bridges, airports, electrical grid and water systems. chao said the administration plans to offer incentives for public private partnerships rather than simply fund improvements.   it was not clear how much new federal funding the trump administration would propose.    she said the plan would aim to speed the processes for government projects.  investors have been growing more skeptical that the infrastructure plan will win approval this year. the dow jones transportation average rose after the election and closed at a record high on march 1 but is now down 4.3 percent for the month.      some investors have questioned how soon trump’s pro growth policies may be implemented. earlier this month, trump proposed $16.2 billion for the department of transportation’s discretionary budget for fiscal year 2018, a reduction of 13 percent. the budget would eliminate $175 million in annual funding for the essential air service, a program to support commercial air service to rural airports and end subsidies for amtrak to operate long distance train service. the trump budget would also eliminate the obama administration’s “tiger” grant program, saving $499 million. that program has been used to fund a variety of transportation projects, including high speed and intracity rail, highway construction and transit bus systems.

" special counsel robert mueller’s team is working with new york attorney general eric schneiderman on its investigation into president donald trump’s former campaign manager paul manafort and his financial transactions, politico reported on wednesday. citing unnamed people familiar with the matter, politico reported mueller’s team, which is investigating possible collusion between trump’s campaign and russia, and schneiderman’s aides have shared evidence and talked frequently about a potential case in recent weeks. the cooperation “could potentially provide mueller with additional leverage to get manafort to cooperate in the larger investigation into trump’s campaign, as trump does not have pardon power over state crimes,” politico reported. cnn reported on tuesday that mueller had issued subpoenas to an attorney who formerly represented manafort and to a manafort spokesman. manafort’s virginia apartment was raided by agents with the federal bureau of investigation last month. the longtime political consultant and lobbyist is being investigated for possible money laundering and has been targeted as someone who might testify against former colleagues, two people familiar with mueller’s work have said. politico said no decision had been made on whether to file charges, and quoted one of the sources as saying “nothing is imminent.” mueller’s team has been looking into manafort’s lobbying work and financial transactions, including real estate deals in new york. manafort, who headed republican trump’s campaign for several months in 2016, has not been accused of any wrongdoing. schneiderman, a democrat, said in may that trump’s firing of former fbi director james comey threatened the integrity of the agency. trump has called schneiderman a “lightweight.” russia has denied any meddling in the 2016 u.s. election. trump has denied any collusion by his campaign and has condemned the investigation as political witch hunt.

" republican presidential candidate donald trump said that “professional agitators” bore much of the blame for violence at his rallies as video showed a protester being beaten and another apparently being grabbed by trump’s campaign manager. speaking on abc’s “this week” on sunday, trump defended campaign manager corey lewandowski and declined to condemn supporters who have attacked protesters at his increasingly chaotic rallies.  nor did he back down from his warning that there would be riots in the streets if the republican party denied him the nomination for the november election, despite his being the most popular candidate among republican voters.  senior figures in the party are openly plotting to prevent trump from becoming the nominee because they view him as insufficiently conservative, and trump was due to privately meet with some party leaders in washington on monday, the washington post reported. “i don’t know what’s going to happen, but i will say this, you’re going to have a lot of unhappy people,” he said on “this week,” predicting anger at the party’s national convention in july should someone else end up the nominee. “i don’t want to see riots, i don’t want to see problems. but you’re talking about millions of people.” scenes of mayhem have become increasingly common at the billionaire new york businessman’s rallies, which have been frequently interrupted by protesters, many of them democrats, who say trump’s controversial remarks on immigrants and muslims are dangerous. the 69 year old candidate has sometimes encouraged his supporters using violence on protesters, and on at least one occasion said that he would like to punch a protester himself. television footage from an arizona rally on saturday showed a man punching and kicking a protester as he was led out of the event. another video appeared to show lewandowski grabbing a protester by the back of his shirt.  trump declined to condemn the violence and said it was often provoked by protesters, who briefly blocked a highway leading to an arizona rally on saturday. “these people are very disruptive people. they’re not innocent lambs,” he said. he also defended lewandowski and said a security official had actually grabbed the protester. lewandowski also manhandled a reporter last week, according to the washington post. “i give him credit for having spirit,” trump said of lewandowski. republican leaders have said trump needs to more clearly discourage his supporters from engaging in violence.  about two dozen senior republican figures will meet with trump at a law firm near the capitol on monday afternoon in what the trump campaign described as an effort to improve “party unity”, the washington post reported. the newspaper did not say who would be attending. candidates were also required to submit their most recently monthly financial disclosures to the federal election commission on sunday. hillary clinton, the front runner for the democratic party’s nomination, raised $30.1 million in february, according to filings, about $12 million less than that raised by chief rival, u.s. senator bernie sanders of vermont in the same period. clinton began march with $31 million in cash on hand, according to filings.

" a top myanmar official appealed on monday for democracy in the country to be given  a chance to survive  amid international anger over a military campaign against rohingya muslims that the united nations has described as ethnic cleansing. some 507,000 rohingya muslim have fled to bangladesh since insurgents attacked security posts near the border on aug. 25, triggering fierce myanmar military retaliation. myanmar says more than 500 people have been killed, most of them insurgents. national security adviser thaung tun told reuters that he has spoken with his u.s. counterpart, h.r. mcmaster, on the phone and visited members of the u.s. congress in washington  last week. he said sanctions were not specifically discussed.  the united states called last week on countries to suspend providing weapons to myanmar s military, but it stopped short of threatening to reimpose u.s. sanctions, which were suspended under the obama administration.  we need to ensure that democracy has a chance to survive in myanmar. this is a young democracy,  thaung tun told reuters in an interview at the united nations, noting that government leader and nobel peace laureate aung san suu kyi has only been in office for 18 months.  suu kyi assumed power following a landslide election win after former military leaders initiated a political transition. for years, the united states and others imposed sanctions on myanmar in support of suu kyi s campaign for democracy.  we have a lot of challenges and these challenges cannot be overcome in a day. rome wasn t built in a day. so we can t undo 50 years of challenges,  said thaung tun, adding that he hoped to meet in person with mcmaster, president donald trump s national security adviser, to brief him on the current situation. a trump administration official said last month the violence made it harder for the united states and myanmar to build warmer ties, and there would likely be some  easing  in the short term, but he did not expect a return to sanctions. thaung tun said he had not met privately with u.s. ambassador to the united nations nikki haley but had spoken to her briefly on the sidelines of other meetings in new york.  the u.n. security council met publicly last week on myanmar for the first time since 2009. haley said the myanmar authorities appeared to be carrying out  a brutal, sustained campaign to cleanse the country of an ethnic minority.  she said countries should stop supplying weapons to myanmar until the military has sufficient accountability measures. thaung tun said  action has been taken against a number of policemen who exceeded their bounds in dealing with detainees.   we have very strict instructions for the security forces to carry out their duties within the bounds of the code of conduct,  he said.  nobody is above the law.  he said that ethnic cleansing or genocide was not happening in myanmar. the myanmar government has said that there have no military operations since sept. 5. but thaung tun said that since then security forces have responded when attacked.   under the cover of night there have been some sporadic attacks and the police and the security people have been required to respond in self defense,  he said.  the rohingya are denied citizenship and classified as illegal immigrants, despite claiming roots in myanmar that go back centuries, with communities marginalized and subjected to bouts of communal violence over the years. bangladesh and myanmar agreed on monday to set up a  working group  to plan the repatriation of those who had fled.

" president donald trump is expected this week to delay relocating the u.s. embassy in israel to jerusalem from tel aviv, u.s. officials and a diplomatic source said on wednesday, despite his campaign pledge to go ahead with the controversial move. with a deadline for a decision looming, trump is likely to  continue his predecessors’ policy of signing a six month waiver overriding a 1995 law requiring that the embassy be transferred to jerusalem, an action that would have complicated his efforts to restart israeli palestinian peace talks, the sources said. trump has yet to make his decision official but is required by law to act by friday, according to one u.s. official who spoke on condition of anonymity.  barring a last minute surprise, trump is expected to renew the waiver. his administration intends to make clear, however, that trump remains committed to the promise he made during the 2016 presidential campaign, though it will not set a specific timetable for doing so, officials said. asked whether trump would sign the waiver, white house spokesman sean spicer told reporters on wednesday: “once we have a decision, we’ll put it out,” adding there would be “something very soon on that.” while there have been divisions among trump’s aides on the issue, the view that appears to have prevailed is that the united states should keep the embassy in tel aviv for now to avoid angering the palestinians, arab governments and western allies while the president seeks to nurture peace efforts. trump avoided any public mention of a potential embassy move during his visit to israel and the west bank in may. despite that, most experts are skeptical of trump’s chances for achieving a peace deal that eluded other u.s. presidents. the status of jerusalem is one of the major stumbling blocks. israel captured arab east jerusalem during the 1967 middle east war and later annexed it, a move not recognized internationally. israel considers all of the city its indivisible capital. pro israel rhetoric the palestinians want east jerusalem as the capital of their future state. jerusalem is home to holy sites of the jewish, muslim and christian religions. shifting the u.s. embassy would be widely seen as washington’s recognition of the israeli position on jerusalem’s status, which successive u.s. administrations have said must be decided in negotiations between the two sides. former president barack obama renewed the waiver in december, setting off a six month clock for trump. cnn was first to report that trump was expected to sign the waiver. on the campaign trail, trump’s pro israel rhetoric raised expectations that he would act quickly to move the embassy. but after he took office in january, the issue lost momentum as he met arab leaders who warned it would be hard to rejuvenate long stalled peace efforts unless he acted as a fair mediator. some of trump’s top aides have pushed for him to keep his campaign promise, not only because it would be welcomed by most israelis but to satisfy the pro israel, right wing base that helped him win the presidency. the state department, however recommended against an embassy move, one u.s. official said. “the president is still committed to moving the embassy,” one u.s. official said. “it’s not a question of whether but when it will be done.” the jerusalem embassy act passed by congress in 1995 mandating relocation of embassy to jerusalem allows the president to waive the requirement in accordance with u.s. national security interests.

" president vladimir putin warned on friday that the standoff between north korea and the united states was close to spilling into a large scale conflict and said it was a mistake to try to pressure pyongyang into halting its nuclear missile program.    putin, due to attend a summit of the brics nations in china next week, said the only way to de escalate tensions was via talks, and sergei lavrov, his foreign minister, said washington not pyongyang should take the initiative on that.   it is essential to resolve the region s problems through direct dialogue involving all sides without advancing any preconditions (for such talks),  putin, whose country shares a border with north korea, wrote on the kremlin s web site.    provocations, pressure, and bellicose and offensive rhetoric is the road to nowhere.  the russian leader, whose nuclear capable bombers recently overflew the korean peninsula in a show of force, said the  situation had deteriorated so badly that it was now  balanced on the verge of a large scale conflict.  pyongyang has been working to develop a nuclear tipped missile capable of hitting the united states and recently threatened to land missiles near the u.s. pacific territory of guam.  on monday, north korea, which sees joint war games between the united states and south korea as preparations for invasion, raised the stakes by firing an intermediate range missile over japan.  in russia s opinion the calculation that it is possible to halt north korea s nuclear missile programs exclusively by putting pressure on pyongyang is erroneous and futile,  putin wrote. a road map formulated by moscow and beijing, which would involve north korea halting its missile program in exchange for the united states and south korea stopping large scale war games, was a way to reduce tensions, wrote putin. lavrov, addressing students in moscow, said he felt events were building towards a war which he said would cause large numbers of casualties in japan and south korea if it happened.  if we want to avoid a war the first step must be taken by the side that is the more intelligent and stronger,  said lavrov, making clear he was referring to the united states.  he said russia was working behind the scenes and that moscow knew that washington had a back channel to pyongyang which he said he hoped would allow the two sides to de escalate.

" u.s. presidential campaigns face threats from hackers bent on espionage and other activity more nefarious than mere political mischief, the office of u.s. national intelligence director james clapper said on wednesday, but did not provide details on specific intrusions. “we’re aware that campaigns and related organizations and individuals are targeted by actors with a variety of motivations   from philosophical differences to espionage   and capabilities   from defacements to intrusions,” clapper’s spokesman, brian hale, said in a statement, deferring to the fbi for details on specific incidents. earlier, clapper said the u.s. intelligence community had “already had some indications” of hacking attempts against presidential campaigns. “as the campaign intensifies we’ll probably have more” attacks, clapper said at a morning event at the bipartisan policy center in washington. the hacking efforts against the campaigns are considered so serious that some congressional committees have been briefed on the activity, a government source said. “given the intense scrutiny paid to the 2016 campaign, and the broad implications for u.s. foreign policy, it’s no surprise that actors are launching cyber attacks against presidential campaigns,” representative adam schiff, the top democrat on the house of representatives permanent select committee on intelligence, said in a statement. the u.s. secret service, which is charged with protecting the presidential candidates, said in a statement that it works to prevent and detect cyber security threats and makes the candidates aware of vulnerabilities. cyber attacks against political candidates occur in countries around the world. the last two u.s. presidential cycles in 2008 and 2012 witnessed a barrage of cyber attacks from a range of adversaries targeting president barack obama’s campaign and the campaigns of his republican foes. u.s. intelligence officials have said many previous assaults were linked to chinese hackers.  matthew prince, co founder and chief executive of cloudflare, which has provided internet security services to donald trump and other presidential candidates, said his company has seen a “surprisingly civil cyber landscape” in the united states compared with elections in other countries where it has worked, such as turkey or mexico.	 “we have not seen anything (in the united states) that would suggest a level of sophistication that you would see if a nation state actor threw its full weight behind it,” prince said. clapper said the department of homeland security and the federal bureau of investigation are working to educate “both campaigns” about cyber threats, likely referring to the campaigns of trump, the presumptive republican nominee, and hillary clinton, the likely democratic nominee. a u.s. security official said foreign hackers would likely seek information about a candidate’s foreign policy intentions and team and about the campaign’s internal operations. the republican and democratic candidates for president will begin receiving intelligence briefings after their official nominations at party conventions this summer.  clapper said the two candidates would receive “exactly the same” briefings. he said the sessions would not be used to try to persuade trump to soften his stance about a proposed ban on muslim immigration, which some national security professionals have said is counterproductive to fighting islamic extremism. “we’ve been doing this for many years, it’s not designed to shape anybody’s world view,” clapper said. because the candidates are briefed in person, u.s. intelligence officials said they are not concerned about hackers eavesdropping on the sessions. but they are worried that trump or clinton might share information with aides, advisers or supporters using email systems that are less secure than those the government uses for classified information.  one official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, cited clinton’s previous use of a private email server when she was secretary of state and noted trump’s reputation for speaking, and tweeting, off the top of his head.

" the u.s. interior department finalized rules on tuesday aimed at preventing methane leaks from oil and gas production on federal and tribal lands, one of the last major obama administration rules aimed at fighting climate change. interior’s bureau of land management (blm) said on tuesday the rule, updating 30 year old regulations that govern flaring, venting and natural gas leaks from oil and gas production, could avoid wasting up to 41 billion cubic feet (bcf) of natural gas per year.  “this rule to prevent waste of our nation’s natural gas supplies is good government, plain and simple,” said interior secretary sally jewell.  “we are proving that we can cut harmful methane emissions that contribute to climate change, while putting in place standards that make good economic sense for the nation.” environmental groups praised the rule, but industry and some western states called it unnecessary. one industry group sued blm. the incoming trump administration has promised to cut what it calls superfluous restrictions on energy production. an interior department fact sheet said that between 2009 and 2015, oil and gas producers vented, flared and leaked 462 bcf of natural gas on federal and indian lands, wasting as much as $23 million annually in royalty revenue. venting and leaks during oil and gas operations cause major emissions of methane, a greenhouse gas at least 25 times more potent than carbon dioxide. the rule would phase in a limit on flaring over several years affecting 16 percent of oil wells, which account for 87 percent of gas flared, the blm said. oil and gas operators can comply by expanding gas capture technology or connecting wells to existing infrastructure through gathering lines. operators would have to use technology such as infrared cameras to detect methane leaks, invisible to the naked eye. blm could also set and adjust royalty rates for oil and gas drilled on federal land to at or above 12.5 percent. currently blm has no discretion to raise the rate. “today’s announcement is a win for western taxpayers.  for too long, big oil companies have wasted natural gas that belongs to all americans with no accountability,” said chris saeger, director of ngo western values project. “blm is right to address methane waste from existing oil and gas facilities; these actions build on important state and federal progress already underway,” said fred krupp, president of the environmental defense fund. moments after the rule’s release, the western energy alliance and independent petroleum association of america filed a lawsuit against the blm in a wyoming court.

" the clinton foundation, the family philanthropy of democratic u.s. presidential candidate hillary clinton, should shut down or transfer operations to another charity despite its good work to avoid perceptions of “pay for play,” the washington post and usa today said in editorials on wednesday.  despite plans announced earlier this week to reorganize the clinton foundation if hillary clinton wins the nov. 8 election, usa today said the global charity must close for the democratic candidate to avoid any appearance of unethical ties.  “the only way to eliminate the odor surrounding the foundation is to wind it down and put it in mothballs, starting today, and transfer its important charitable work to another large american charity such as the bill & melinda gates foundation,” the paper’s editorial board wrote.   the gates foundation declined to share its thoughts on the idea. “we really can’t speculate about the future of the clinton foundation,” amy enright, a gates foundation spokeswoman, wrote in an email. the newspaper also published an editorial by donna shalala, the clinton foundation’s president, in which she argued that the foundation helps millions of people, especially in developing countries, and so scaling down its work was not simple. “this suggestion ignores how global philanthropy works, and the reality that there are human beings around the world who would be affected by these decisions,” shalala wrote. the foundation announced on monday that it would stop accepting at least some foreign and corporate donations if clinton wins the presidency and that her husband, former president bill clinton, would resign from the foundation’s board. the washington post said in its editorial that these changes were insufficient and should have happened sooner, before hillary clinton served as secretary of state from 2009 to 2013. “the foundation undoubtedly does worthwhile work,” the post’s editorial board wrote. “should ms. clinton win, all of that work and all of the foundation’s assets should be spun off to an organization with no ties to the first family.” the clintons’ daughter, chelsea clinton, remains on the board of the charity, the full name of which is the bill, hillary & chelsea clinton foundation. the call from two leading u.s. news organizations came as republican presidential candidate donald trump and other members of his party have taken to calling for a special prosecutor to investigate what they say is corruption. the clinton campaign has dismissed such calls as groundless political smears. republicans see attacking clinton over the organization as a way of unifying conservatives divided over trump, who has never held elected officer and who often deviates from conservative orthodoxy. democrats hope the controversy comes too late to make a difference in the election, in which most national public opinion polls show clinton ahead.  the foundation has said hillary clinton was not involved with the group while serving as the nation’s top diplomat. the clinton campaign denies clinton ever took any action because of donations to the foundation. clinton campaign manager robby mook told msnbc on wednesday that clinton does not have a conflict of interest with charitable work, and pointed to her rival’s business interests with wall street, china and russia. “donald trump and his bottom line and his networks are directly connected to all kinds of international entities ... and nobody’s asking him to disclose or divest,” mook said of the new york businessman. trump has responded by saying it is clinton, not he, who has close ties to russia.

" a group of former u.s. national security officials, including some who have worked for top republicans, called donald trump’s recent comments about nato, russia’s annexation of crimea and other matters “disgraceful” in a letter released on thursday. in the last month, the republican presidential nominee has suggested he might not defend nato allies if they did not spend more on defense, appeared to invite russia to hack the emails of democratic opponent hillary clinton and suggested he might accept russia’s 2014 annexation of crimea from ukraine. “these are disgraceful statements that betray our longstanding values and national interests embraced by presidents of both parties,” said the open letter first reported by the washington post. most of the 37 who signed the letter appear to be democrats, including madeleine albright and leon panetta, respectively former secretaries of state and defense, but others served under republican presidents and lawmakers. among these, john bellinger was state department legal adviser for former secretary of state condoleezza rice, and randy scheunemann, a neoconservative political operative, was foreign policy advisor to republican john mccain’s presidential campaign. other signatories included former career diplomats tom pickering, bill burns, nicholas burns and marc grossman, all of whom served as undersecretary of state for political affairs, effectively the third ranking u.s. diplomat.   the letter is the latest in a series from former national security officials dismayed at the thought of a trump presidency. in march, more than 90 republican foreign policy veterans, including former deputy secretary of state robert zoellick, signed a letter pledging to oppose trump and saying his proposals would undermine u.s. security.

" the 10 year old daughter of a jailed vietnamese blogger,  mother mushroom , has appealed to u.s. first lady melania trump to help win her mother s release ahead of president donald trump s visit to vietnam next month. the handwritten letter, posted on facebook on thursday, drew attention to vietnam s biggest crackdown on dissidents in years before the asia pacific economic cooperation (apec) summit in november. nguyen ngoc nhu quynh, 37, known as  me nam  (mother mushroom), is one of vietnam s most prominent activists. she was jailed for 10 years in june for publishing anti state reports, including one about deaths in police custody. her daughter nguyen bao nguyen, nicknamed  mushroom , referred to trump s upcoming visit to vietnam and the  international women of courage award  awarded by the first lady to quynh in march, which drew an angry response from hanoi.  please help my family re unite because i know my mother did nothing wrong,  nguyen wrote in the letter, published on quynh s mother s facebook page.  we love our mother so much and just want her to come back to us,  said nguyen, who turns 11 on saturday. vietnam s government did not immediately respond to a request to comment.  the united states has advocated for ms. quynh s release, and the release of all prisoners of conscience, multiple times with high level vietnamese officials in the run up to the president s visit to vietnam   including in recent days and weeks,  u.s. ambassador ted osius told reuters.  despite sweeping economic reform and increasing openness to social change, media censorship remains tight in vietnam and criticism of the communist state is not tolerated. at least 17 dissidents have been arrested this year in a crackdown that followed changes within the ruling party hierarchy and a growing number of environmental protests. vietnam has carried out a simultaneous crackdown on corruption. trump is set to attend the apec forum in the seaside resort of danang, besides making an official visit to vietnam.  international donors and trade partners need to step up pressure on the country s leaders to improve its abysmal rights record, and the apec summit is a good moment to start,  said brad adams, asia director of human rights watch. quynh s mother, nguyen tuyet lan, is now looking after nguyen and her four year old brother  bear . she told reuters:  my daughter did nothing wrong; just consider what she did as constructive criticism for society.

" shelling killed around ten people, including five children at a school gate, in a besieged rebel enclave near syria s capital damascus on tuesday, a day after a u.n. aid delivery to the area, a war monitor said. the shelling also injured 30 other people in the eastern ghouta area, the syrian observatory for human rights said.  the britain based monitor said the ongoing shelling which began tuesday morning hit the towns of jisreen, douma, saqba, mesraba, harasta, ain terma, hazza and kafr batna.  on monday a united nations and syrian arab red crescent (sarc) convoy delivered aid to the towns of kafr batna and saqba.     a tightening siege by government forces has pushed people to the verge of famine in the eastern suburbs, residents and aid workers said last week, bringing desperation to the only major rebel enclave near the syrian capital.  syrian state television on tuesday said shells had also hit parts of government held damascus, injuring at least five people.      in july, moscow and rebels in eastern ghouta signed a deal to make the area a  de escalation zone . the agreement raised hopes of open crossings and aid flows.     the aid organisation international rescue committee said on monday the de escalation zone agreements with rebel areas across syria were failing to protect civilians.   the safety of civilians has not improved with the establishment of these so called de escalation areas. with so many armed groups not covered by ceasefire agreements, we have even seen periods of increased aerial bombardment,  irc s middle east director of public affairs tom garofalo said.

" the mother and sister of a prominent critic of rwanda s president said on friday all three of them had been tortured and deprived of food as they were held in jail on charges of forgery and inciting insurrection. adeline rwigara told a court she and her daughters were handcuffed day and night. she is being held alongside her daughter diane shima rwigara, a 35 year old accountant who tried to stand against president paul kagame in august elections. diane rwigara, who is accused of faking the registration papers for the election, was eventually barred from running and kagame went on to win with 98.8 percent of the vote. she has repeatedly accused kagame of stifling dissent and criticized his rwandan patriotic front s tight grip on the country since it fought its way to power to end rwanda s 1994 genocide.  kagame has repeatedly denied cracking down on dissent. justice minister johnston busingye on friday declined to comment of the torture allegations, saying they were a matter for the court.  since august 29, i and my children were tortured,  adeline told the panel of three judges.  we were handcuffed day and night, without eating or drinking,  adeline said, adding they had once gone without food and medication for a week. diane s younger sister anne said the family has also been kept in solitary confinement.  imagine staying in a closed room for 24 hours without access to fresh air. at least allow us to bask in the sun for 30 minutes and be visited,  she said. diane rwigara was in court but did not speak. their lawyer buhuru pierre celestin told the court that their confinement violated international conventions. in response, prosecutors told the court that the defendants  rights were respected, without commenting on the torture allegations. on tuesday, human rights watch said the government routinely and unlawfully detained and tortured detainees with beatings, asphyxiations, mock executions and electric shocks. asked by reuters to respond to rwigara s torture accusations, minister of justice johnston busingye said:  issues raised in court are determined by the court. if there is a claim of torture in court, the court is the proper place to examine it and determine what happened.  the trial will resume on monday.

" civil liberties groups on wednesday said they were filing a series of lawsuits against the u.s. government seeking details on how federal agencies enforced president donald trump’s ban on travelers from seven muslim majority countries. the lawsuits were filed by local chapters of the american civil liberties union against u.s. customs and border protection and the department of homeland security and cover their operations in 14 cities stretching from portland, maine, to san diego. the suits are an attempt to enforce requests filed under the freedom of information act (foia) just days after trump signed his first executive order limiting travel. that jan. 27 order, intended to fulfill a campaign promise to take a tough stance on immigration, first temporarily barred travelers from iran, iraq, libya, somalia, sudan, syria and yemen. the order, which also temporarily barred refugees, led to a weekend of chaos at u.s. airports with travelers barred from entering the country upon landing while thousands of people turned out to protest the measures. a federal judge ordered a halt to enforcement of that ban and trump followed up in march with a less sweeping order that did not limit travelers from iraq, but which has also been challenged in courts. opponents said the orders violated the u.s. constitution’s prohibitions on religious discrimination, citing trump’s campaign promises to impose a “muslim ban.” the trump administration said the restrictions are legal and are necessary to protect u.s. national security. the suits, filed in federal courts, seek disclosure of how many people have been detained or subjected to additional screening since the first executive order as well as the guidance that was provided to dhs staff about how to enforce the order. “customs and border protection has a long, rich history of ignoring its obligations under the freedom of information act and so these lawsuits are an effort to enforce its obligations,” said zachary heiden, legal director at the aclu of maine, in a phone interview. he noted that the aclu filed its foia requests for information on feb. 2. officials at cbp and dhs did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the suits. in addition to portland and san diego, the suits cover cbp operations in atlanta, baltimore, boston, chicago, detroit, houston, los angeles, san francisco, seattle, tucson, miami and tampa. one suit filed in florida covers the two cities in that state.

" the u.s. congress may be headed for a reckoning with the federal debt limit within weeks, thanks to wealthy americans and corporations deferring tax payments in the hope that they would benefit from the lower tax rates promised by president trump. trump promised tax cuts during his election campaign last year and has reiterated those promises in recent months leading some wealthy americans and businesses to shift accounting for income into the future, betting that lower tax rates will arrive, perhaps in 2018, wealth managers told reuters. “everyone wants to talk about deferring income,” said mark copeland, senior partner at signature estate & investment advisors llc in newport beach, california.  the u.s. stock market has also rallied since trump’s election victory in november, partly on hopes for lower corporate tax rates.  “we are starting to prepare clients for potentially lower taxes in 2018,” said julia carlson, chief executive and at financial freedom wealth management group llc in oregon. trump promised to cut taxes as far back as september 2015 in a four page plan and reiterated those promises in a two page “contract with the american voter” before last november’s election and again in a one page document in april, but republicans in congress remain divided on tax reform. the delay to tax payments could help to explain why tax receipts this fiscal year are coming in more slowly than projected, said tax experts and the congressional budget office (cbo), an arm of congress. “taxpayers may have shifted more income than projected ... to later years, expecting legislation to reduce tax rates to be enacted this year,” the cbo said in a monthly report on wednesday. the weaker tax revenues this year have forced the u.s. treasury to borrow more money than expected to cover the federal budget deficit and that is putting the government on track to hit its legal debt limit sooner than expected, experts said. the u.s. government has a legal limit on how much it can borrow, currently set at about $19.8 trillion and the limit can only be increased by a vote of congress. the need to raise the debt limit usually creates partisan debate in washington. conservative republicans like to use the debt limit issue as leverage to demand cuts in spending but democrats and moderate republicans usually oppose such ultimatums on the grounds that the borrowings are used to fund spending approved previously by congress.   this year, with trump’s legislative agenda stalled and congress preoccupied by trump’s firing of former fbi director james comey, the house republicans known as the house freedom caucus along with outside conservative groups are again demanding spending cuts for support to raise the debt limit. in 2011 the failure to raise the debt limit in a timely way and the possibility that the u.s. government might default on its obligations led to the u.s. losing its prized triple a credit rating from standard & poor’s. since mid march the u.s. treasury has been using emergency funding powers to postpone hitting the debt limit and those measures had been expected to last until about october, but lower tax receipts so far this year may mean the debt limit will be hit sooner than expected. treasury secretary steven mnuchin urged congress last month to raise the debt ceiling before lawmakers break for a long august summer recess, a call echoed last week by house democratic leader nancy pelosi.

" the saudi led military coalition fighting in yemen said it will continue to block the main aid route into the country until it is satisfied its houthi opponents cannot use it to bring in weapons. the coalition closed all air, land and sea access to yemen last week following the interception of a missile fired toward the saudi capital, saying it had to stem the flow of arms to the houthis from iran. aid agencies warned the move would worsen the humanitarian crisis in the country, where the war has left an estimated seven million people facing famine. ports controlled by yemen s exiled government would reopen soon, the coalition said on sunday in a statement issued by the saudi mission at the united nations. however other ports, including houthi controlled hodeidah   where some 80 percent of yemen s food supplies enter   will remain closed until a u.n. verification regime is reviewed to ensure no weapons reach the houthis, the statement said.  the coalition, in consultation and full agreement with the legitimate government, will begin steps related to re opening of airports and ports in yemen to allow the transport of humanitarian and commercial cargo,  the statement said. it said the first steps will start within 24 hours and will include the southern ports of aden and mukalla and the red sea port of al mokha, which are all controlled by hadi s government. the coalition asked u.n. secretary general antonio guterres to send a delegation to riyadh to  review current inspection measures to reinforce and introduce a more effective inspection and verification regime (unvim) aimed at facilitating the flow of humanitarian and commercial supplies and prevent smuggling of weapons, ammunition and missile parts...  saudi arabia has accused arch foe iran of supplying the ballistic missile which was shot down near riyadh airport without causing any casualties. iran has denied the accusation.  the united nations and international aid organizations have repeatedly criticized the coalition in the past for blocking aid access, especially to the north, which is held by the iran aligned houthis battling the saudi led coalition. more than 10,000 people have been killed in the conflict, which pits the internationally recognized government, backed by saudi arabia and its allies, against the houthis and forces loyal to former president ali abdullah saleh. the saudi led coalition has been targeting the houthis since they seized parts of yemen in 2015, including the capital sanaa, forcing president abd rabbu mansour hadi to flee and seek help from neighboring saudi arabia.

" donald trump was not in the room during u.s. president barack obama’s final state of the union speech, but the republican presidential front runner was a looming presence nonetheless.  both obama’s speech on tuesday and, for that matter, the republican response by south carolina governor nikki haley, took pains to rebuke trump, the real estate billionaire whose red hot rhetoric has endeared him to some and dismayed others in the campaign for the nov. 8 presidential election. obama and haley, although from different parties, offered a defense of establishment politics, a plea for optimism and a quest for common ground. obama seemed to refer specifically to trump’s call for a temporary ban on muslim immigration following a deadly shooting attack last month in san bernardino, california, by a couple authorities said had been radicalized. “we need to reject any politics that targets people because of race or religion. this isn’t a matter of political correctness,” obama said. trump has mounted much of his insurgent candidacy on the notion of america losing ground, both economically and in terms of global influence. obama rejected that idea outright.  “it’s easier to be cynical,” obama said, “to accept that change isn’t possible, and politics is hopeless, and to believe that our voices and actions don’t matter.” soon after obama concluded his remarks in the chamber of the house of representatives, trump tweeted: “the state of the union speech was one of the most boring, rambling and non substantive i have heard in a long time.” while consistently criticizing obama’s record, haley, the daughter of indian immigrants and a potential republican vice presidential choice, also seemed to indict trump’s message. “some people think that you have to be the loudest voice in the room to make a difference,” she said. “that is just not true. often, the best thing we can do is turn down the volume. when the sound is quieter, you can actually hear what someone else is saying. and that can make a world of difference.” like obama, haley did not mention trump by name during her address but she criticized him in an interview on nbc’s “today show” on wednesday while calling on the republican party to be more inclusive. “mr. trump has definitely contributed to what i think is just irresponsible talk,” she said. trump responded shortly afterward by telling fox news that haley has been “very weak on illegal immigration” for a long time. paul sracic, chairman of the politics department at youngstown state university in ohio, said trump was dominating “our political discourse in a way that no one would have predicted even a year ago.” “donald trump must be smiling tonight,” he said, pointing out that the candidate managed to make himself the target of not just the state of the union address, but also the republican response. the white house gave haley credit for defending “american values” in her speech. “she was willing to do something that a lot of other republicans   leading republicans   have been unwilling to do,” white house spokesman josh earnest told reporters on wednesday.  but he stressed that the administration disagrees with many of haley’s positions. obama flew on wednesday to nebraska, a republican “red state,” to promote the big picture ideas he laid out in his speech.  on tuesday night, obama also appeared to single out conservative texas senator ted cruz, the top challenger to trump in the republican race. cruz has called for a massive bombing campaign in iraq and syria to wipe out islamic state forces. meeting the threat of islamic state, obama said, “needs to be more than tough talk or calls to carpet bomb civilians.” democratic strategist brad bannon said obama “made the argument very well that leadership is not bombing the crap out of someone.”  cruz quickly countered in a statement. obama, he said, “lectures us on civility yet he has been one of the most divisive presidents in american history.” both trump and cruz, who are topping opinion polls weeks before the early nomination contests in iowa and new hampshire, have pledged to push the republican party in a more confrontational direction, and seek to undo much of what obama has accomplished as president. both candidates are likely in coming days to hammer the obama administration on its approach to islamic state.     obama’s defense of pragmatic politics may also help his former secretary of state, hillary clinton, who is trying to stave off a challenge from self described democratic socialist bernie sanders in the democratic presidential contest, said bannon.  “he’s taking about holding up the establishment,” he said. “when the president makes a good case, it helps hillary more than bernie.” but john geer, an expert on voter opinion at vanderbilt university, thought obama, in his bid for unity, damaged clinton’s prospects by not making a stronger case for  continuing the democratic agenda. “he didn’t put forward an argument why there should be another democrat for four years,” geer said. “i think she would have liked to see that.”     ",0

" in a move certain to please conservatives, president donald trump on friday added five names to his list of candidates for a prospective u.s. supreme court vacancy as he presses ahead with a campaign to move the federal judiciary to the right. two of them are appellate judges who were nominated by trump earlier this year and confirmed by the senate: amy coney barrett and kevin newsom. another, brett kavanaugh, sits on the u.s. court of appeals in washington, long viewed as a stepping stone to the high court.  the others were britt grant, a georgia supreme court justice, and patrick wyrick, a oklahoma supreme court justice. there is no current vacancy on the u.s. supreme court but three justices are 79 or older. during his presidential campaign last year, trump identified 20 conservative candidates for the supreme court. upon taking office, he named neil gorsuch to the court to replace the late justice antonin scalia, restoring the supreme court’s conservative majority. gorsuch was confirmed by the senate in april and has established himself as one of the supreme court’s most conservative justices. speaking at a federalist society conference of conservative legal advocates, white house counsel donald mcgahn said trump is “very committed” to appointing judges who are “committed originalists and textualists,” referring to a legal philosophy that relies on the actual wording of laws and the original meaning of the u.s. constitution.  “they all have paper trails. they all are sitting judges. there is nothing unknown about them. what you see is what you get,” mcgahn said. the five jurists, all with strong conservative credentials, were added to the list with input from conservative leaders, and should another seat on the court open up, trump will nominate a candidate from the updated list of 25, the white house said. leonard leo, an advisor to the president on supreme court nominations, said trump thought it was time to refresh the original list. “when you’re committed to picking from a list you want to make sure it’s as complete as possible,” leo said in an interview. kavanaugh, who was appointed to the federal bench in 2006 by republican former president george w. bush, served as a white house counsel under bush and worked as an assistant to kenneth starr, the independent counsel who investigated democratic former president bill clinton during the monica lewinsky scandal. grant and wyrick both joined state challenges to the affordable care act, democratic former president barack obama’s signature healthcare law, and obama regulations aimed at reducing emissions from coal burning power plants, said carrie severino, chief counsel of the judicial crisis network, a conservative legal advocacy group.  the court currently consists of five conservatives and four liberals, with conservative justice anthony kennedy sometimes joining with the liberals on high profile issues such as gay rights and abortion. at 81, kennedy is the second oldest justice on the court behind liberal ruth bader ginsburg, 84, and some former kennedy clerks have said he is considering retirement. liberal justice stephen breyer is 79. should any of those step down, trump would get a historic opportunity to shape the court in a more conservative direction for decades to come. supreme court appointments are lifetime jobs. conservatives criticize the federal judiciary as too liberal, and attorney general jeff sessions at the same conference lashed out at “activist judges.” trump already has taken steps to make the federal judiciary more conservative, with 14 judicial appointees already confirmed by the senate and more in the pipeline. catherine glenn foster, president of the anti abortion advocacy group americans united for life, said she was pleased with the new selections. “from their known records they tend to be strong on recognizing the protections for life,” she said in an interview.  on friday, republican alabama governor kay ivey said she would support her party’s senate candidate roy moore, who has been accused by several women of unwanted sexual contact, because of the importance of keeping the senate under republican control should another supreme court vacancy arise.

" u.s. president barack obama said he was confident that britain and the european union would be able to agree an orderly transition to a new relationship after last month’s brexit vote. “as difficult as it will be, i am confident that the uk and the eu will be able to agree on an orderly transition to a new relationship,” obama said in an article for the financial times, calling upon nato to stand united against global challenges. “the special relationship between the us and the uk will endure. i have no doubt that the uk will remain one of nato’s most capable members.” obama urged nato to unite following britain’s june 23 vote to leave the eu and stressed that the alliance between the united states and its closest ally in europe would endure brexit.

" japanese prime minister shinzo abe will propose new cabinet level u.s. japan talks on trade, security and macroeconomic issues, including currencies, when he meets u.s. president donald trump on friday, a japanese government official involved in planning the summit said. abe heads to washington later on thursday hoping promises to help create u.s. jobs and bolster japan’s military will persuade trump to turn down the heat on trade and currency and stand by the decades old alliance. “in a situation in which security relations in the asia pacific region are increasingly severe, it is very important to demonstrate the unshakeable u.s. japan alliance at home and abroad,” japanese chief cabinet secretary yoshihide suga told a news conference. “this is the most important theme of the u.s. japan leaders summit,” he said, adding it was also vital to have constructive discussions on how to create a “win win” relationship by further strengthening u.s. japan economic ties. trump has lumped japan with china and mexico as big contributors to the u.s. trade deficit, targeted its auto trade as “unfair” and accused tokyo of using monetary policy to devalue its currency to boost exports. “we use monetary easing, fiscal policy and structural reform in order to escape from deflation. we don’t engage in competitive currency devaluation or target specific levels,”    masahiko shibayama, an adviser to the premier, told reuters. “we’ll explain based on the fact that japanese automakers are contributing to u.s. jobs through their local subsidiaries.” during his election campaign, trump complained tokyo was not sharing enough of the cost of the u.s. security umbrella although his defense secretary, jim mattis, assured japan the alliance was firm when he visited the country last week.  abe, who will be accompanied by finance minister taro aso and foreign minister fumio kishida, will bring a package of steps tokyo says could create 700,000 u.s. jobs through private public investment in infrastructure such as high speed trains, government sources say. trump, who abandoned the 12 nation trans pacific partnership (tpp) trade pact championed by his predecessor barack obama and abe as a counterweight to a rising china, has made clear he wants a bilateral free trade agreement (fta) with tokyo instead. abe has left the door open to fta talks but japanese officials worry such negotiations would boost pressure on politically sensitive sectors such as agriculture while yielding few economic benefits for japan. the new cabinet level talks, the government official told reuters, would be a way of buying time rather than opening fta talks at an early stage.  tokyo and washington already have a cabinet level mechanism for security talks, the so called “2 plus 2” meetings of defense and foreign ministers. the new economic framework will be headed by aso, who is also deputy prime minister, and u.s. vice president mike pence, and would address a range of issues, with a focus on crafting trade policies and measures to bolster u.s. employment, said a report in the nikkei business daily. abe is likely to propose crafting highly liberal rules for trade and investment in areas such as intellectual property protection, rules of origin, regulations on state owned companies and e commerce, the nikkei said. japan hopes such bilateral rules would be similar to those agreed upon in the tpp and could be extended to cover the asia pacific region to counter china’s growing clout, it added. the two nations are also preparing statements regarding economic cooperation and security to be issued after the summit meeting, the nikkei said.  abe and trump will also play a round of gold in florida this weekend after the meeting at the white house on friday and trump said he will make sure the japanese leader is his partner in the game, rather than a competitor.

" the house of representatives passed legislation on wednesday to block the purchase of “heavy water” from iran, defying president barack obama’s veto threat a year after the announcement of the landmark iran nuclear agreement. the house passed the “no 2h2o from iran act” by 249 176, with support coming almost exclusively from republicans, who hold a majority of seats in the chamber. every congressional republican, and a few of obama’s fellow democrats, opposed the nuclear deal between iran and the united states and other world powers announced last july 14 in which tehran agreed to curtail its nuclear program in exchange for relief from crippling international sanctions. they argued that obama was so eager to bolster his foreign policy legacy that he agreed to sanctions relief iran did not deserve because it lied about its nuclear program, supported militant groups that attack u.s. allies and perpetrated human rights abuses. deal opponents have repeatedly introduced legislation that the administration sees as efforts to undermine the international agreement. deal supporters said the agreement was the best way to defuse a dispute over iran’s nuclear program that threatened further middle east destabilization. heavy water is a non radioactive byproduct from making nuclear weapons and nuclear energy. the obama administration said in april the united states would buy $8.6 million worth of heavy water from iran, angering republicans who called it a subsidy of the country’s nuclear program. the white house issued a threat on monday to veto the bill, and two others the house is due to consider later this week. representative ed royce, chairman of the house foreign affairs committee, denied that the house measure would violate the landmark pact. he said it would deter iran from producing heavy water by making its sale more difficult. separately, two senate republicans and two democrats said on wednesday they would introduce their own iran related bill. the measure introduced by republicans bob corker, chairman of the senate foreign relations committee, and marco rubio and democrats robert menendez and joe manchin would expand sanctions for iran’s ballistic missile development, sanction transfers of conventional weapons to or from iran and extend the iran sanctions act. the iran sanctions act, which imposed sanctions over iran’s missile development and support for terrorism, expires at the end of 2016. lawmakers have been in discussions for months over the best way to address its renewal.

" (reuters)   australia will send troops to assist philippine forces in the ongoing battle against islamic state fighters in the southern city of marawi, australia s defense minister marise payne said on friday. small contingents of australian soldiers will be sent to train philippine troops, payne said during a press conference with her counterpart, delfin lorenzana in manila.   we are very committed to supporting the philippines in its efforts to defend itself against terrorist threats,  minister payne said.  this is a threat to the region (that) we all need to work together to defeat.  but no australian troops will be actively involved in the fighting, lorenza said.  it would not look good if we would be needing troops to fight the war here. we are happy with the assistance we re getting from australia.  the militants swept through marawi on may 23 and have held parts of it despite sustained ground attacks by hundreds of soldiers and daily pummeling by planes and artillery. the southern philippines has been marred for decades by insurgency and banditry. but the intensity of the battle in marawi and the presence of foreign fighters fighting alongside local militants has raised concerns that the region may be becoming a southeast asian hub for islamic state as it loses ground in iraq and syria. the australian troops will compliment those from their country already sent to the philippines to train local personnel, payne said. philippine troops fighting islamic state linked rebels in a southern city have encountered armed resistance from women and children who were likely family member of militants, the phillipine military said on monday. a spokesman for payne said further details of the training contingent would be determined in coming days.

" one of the contenders to be singapore s next leader, cabinet member chan chun sing, on monday said he and his colleagues had an obligation to be ready to take on the job. in rare comments about succession by a public official, chan said whoever took over was unlikely to drastically change the government s policy direction.  all of us have to be prepared to do the job when called upon,  chan, a former army chief, told journalists at a foreign correspondents association of singapore briefing, when asked if he would like the job of prime minister.  in singapore, leadership is a responsibility to be borne, not a position to be sought,  he said, citing a comment previously made by transport minister khaw boon wan.  chan, 47, who holds the title of minister in the prime minister s office, is one of a handful of men mentioned as potential successors to prime minister lee hsien loong, who has said he is ready to step down in a couple of years. singapore news media have cited chan as one of a number of  contenders to succeed lee.  lee, who is the eldest son of singapore s founding father lee kuan yew, has said the new leader is probably already in the cabinet, but a clear choice has yet to emerge. deputy prime minister tharman shanmugaratnam, also mentioned as a potential successor, has repeatedly said he does not want the job. the singapore media and political analysts say finance minister heng swee keat and education minister ong ye kung are also in contention.  questions about succession in the wealthy southeast asian city state   which has been governed by the people s action party since independence in 1965   came into focus when lee, who has twice survived cancer, took ill during a televised speech last year and stumbled at a podium. doctors subsequently said there were no serious concerns. lee kuan yew s successor, goh chok tong, was identified at least five years in advance while the current leader, who first entered politics in 1984, was also groomed for the position long before he took office in 2004.  chan entered politics in 2011 after serving more than two decades in the singapore army, retiring as a major general.

" presidential hopeful jo o doria, the mayor of brazil s largest city, made it clear on monday that he is not married to the centrist brazilian social democracy party (psdb) and is open to courtship from other parties. the stance of the rising young star of brazilian politics will put the psdb under pressure since his mentor and party stalwart, geraldo alckmin, the governor of sao paulo, also plans a presidential bid in next year s elections.  i will become a candidate the day i declare and have the support of a party,  doria told reporters after addressing a business conference in sao paulo on monday, without naming the psdb. while he has not announced that he will run, the 59 year old self made millionaire and former tv presenter has said he would accept if nominated by his party. a datafolha poll in june showed doria is little known by brazilian voters compared to alckmin, but he has a far lower rejection rate and is on track to become more popular than the governor, who lost a presidential bid in 2004 to workers party incumbent luiz inacio lula da silva. alckmin has said publicly that he intends to run in the oct. 7 election and favors a u.s. style primary if the psdb has several contenders for the nomination. doria opposes holding a primary and has not ruled out quitting the party. in an interview published on monday by the estado de s.paulo newspaper, the mayor said the party should pick its candidate based on who the opinion polls say is more popular. doria said he would continue in the psdb but that other parties were reaching out to him and he left open the option of leaving to run for president.  i intend to continue in the psdb, until some circumstance prevents me from doing so,  he told the newspaper in paris, where he met on friday with french president emmanuel macron, a similarly young untested politician who rapidly rose to office. doria, an outsider who won his first election last year in a landslide victory for sao paulo mayor, has become a potential favorite center right candidate offering an fresh clean face among brazil s corruption plagued political class.

" u.s. secretary of state john kerry is confident after speaking to his philippine counterpart that the two countries can “work through” a period of confusion caused by anti american rhetoric from president rodrigo duterte, the state department said on monday. state department spokesman john kirby said kerry expressed concern in his conversation on sunday with foreign minister perfecto yasay about the tone of remarks by the philippine president, who has sharply criticized president barack obama and talked of separation from washington. at the same time, kerry emphasized strong and stable ties between the longtime allies, while kirby said washington had seen no practical action by manila to move away from those. kerry’s conversation with yasay came after duterte provoked alarm last week by announcing a “separation” from the united states and realignment with china during a visit to beijing. although duterte said later he did not really mean separation, his remarks added to concerns about the future of a u.s. philippine military cooperation pact seen as crucial to projecting u.s. power in asia in the face of fast rising china. earlier on monday, the most senior u.s. diplomat for asia,  assistant secretary of state for east asia daniel russel, said in manila that washington remained a “trusted” ally to the philippines and supported its blossoming ties with china. russel was the first high level visitor from washington since duterte’s remarks and kirby said that both russel and kerry made clear the united states had every intention of continuing to meet its security commitments to the philippines. “the tone and tenor of the discussions that they had ... and the assurances that the philippine side gave to their commitment to keeping the relationship going was enough to lead the secretary and the assistant secretary to believe that we were going to be able to work through this,” kirby told a regular news briefing.  in his comments to reporters, russel said he had candidly told yasay that manila’s friends were concerned about the high loss of life in duterte’s campaign against drugs and reiterated the importance of due process. russel said “a real climate of uncertainty about the philippines’ intentions had created consternation in many countries,” including the united states. he said that worry extended beyond governments to corporate boardrooms and warned that it was “bad for business” in “a very competitive region.” since duterte took office on june 30, he has been scathing about u.s. criticism of his anti drug campaign, in which about 2,300 people have been killed. but his ministers have repeatedly sought to soften his more outspoken remarks. explaining duterte’s “goodbye america” remarks, yasay said on saturday the united states remained the “closest friend” of the philippines but that manila wanted to break away from a “mindset of dependency and subservience” and forge closer ties with other nations. russel said duterte himself had “already walked back” his remarks and added that washington supported direct dialogue and negotiations between the philippines and china. “we don’t want countries to have to choose between the u.s. and china,” he said.

" former finalist simona halep survived a first set wobble to reach the third round of the french open for only the second time in her career with a 7 6(5) 6 2 win over kazakhstan’s zarina diyas on wednesday.  the romanian sixth seed surrendered her serve twice in the opening four games to trail 4 1 but delved into her wealth of experience to finally subdue her 90th ranked opponent 7 5 in the tie break. more exchanges of breaks followed in the second set before halep finally found her groove to take a 5 2 lead and set up three match points on diyas’ serve. the first one went begging but halep’s gritty baseline play paid off in the next point as diyas bowed out after flicking a forehand long to end a 10 shot rally. “the first set was very tough and i was very nervous as i seemed to be fighting for every point,” halep said in a court side interview. the good news for halep is that the only previous time she reached the last 32, she made it all the way to the 2014 roland garros final. halep and her bizarre black and white zebra print dress will be back on court on friday when she takes on japan’s naomi osaka for a place in the fourth round.

" donald trump’s emergence as the last man standing in the republican presidential race has prompted his critics inside the party to intensify their search for a candidate they could back as a serious third party alternative. political operatives are courting donors, calling potential candidates and developing legal contingency plans for overcoming onerous ballot qualification laws. “this is as much as anything a battle for the future of american party politics,” said republican strategist joel searby, who is working with conservative writer bill kristol, among others, on an effort to identify a third party candidate to run in the nov. 8 presidential election. a separate group, conservatives against trump, which includes blogger erick erickson, has been holding calls and meetings to discuss third party candidates as well as other options to stop the new york billionaire from winning the white house. the hurdles to a third party candidacy are immense. no independent candidate has ever won a presidential election, although some have played spoilers. but the efforts by the republican groups underscore the unusual divisiveness of trump’s candidacy within republican ranks ahead of a likely general election fight with democratic front runner hillary clinton. trump’s opposition to free trade is at odds with the views of many republicans, especially in the party’s business wing. many of trump’s critics also find his rhetoric offensive, including his call to temporarily bar muslims from entering the country and his comment describing mexican immigrants to the united states as rapists and drug dealers. some republicans say they worry that any third party candidate would only siphon votes away from trump and help clinton win the election. ralph nader’s green party presidential run has been blamed by some democrats for the razor thin defeat of democratic nominee al gore in the 2000 election. ross perot’s independent candidacy in 1992 was seen by some republicans as contributing to president george h.w. bush’s loss to democrat bill clinton.   one outcome, though rare, may be that no candidate crosses the necessary threshold of 270 votes in the u.s. electoral college. in that case, the vote for the next president would pass to the u.s. house of representatives, currently controlled by republicans.   deborah demoss fonseca, who recruited donors for former republican presidential candidate jeb bush and is working with conservatives against trump, said her group was trying to find a candidate who would be high profile enough to compete with trump and clinton. but finding a candidate of that caliber who would be willing to run is no easy feat. searby’s group has reached out to former secretary of state condoleezza rice and james mattis, a retired u.s. marine corps general, among others, but both declined after discussions. republican u.s. senator ben sasse of nebraska has emerged as a favorite of the republicans seeking a third party candidate. kristol has had warm words for him. sasse, a freshman lawmaker and former bush administration official, is a strong critic of trump and has called for an alternative candidate to him. but he says that person should be someone other than him. on wednesday, the morning after trump emerged as the presumptive presidential nominee, phones at the office of libertarian party candidate gary johnson were ringing off the hook with calls from small government republicans who feel they cannot get behind trump. but as a libertarian, johnson holds views on some issues, such as the legalization of marijuana, that are antithetical to the views of some republicans.  in march, former new york mayor michael bloomberg, an independent, said he had considered jumping into the race as a third party candidate but opted against it, saying he feared it would only serve to help get trump elected. one of the biggest hurdles to a third party run is simply getting on the ballot in enough states to mount a viable campaign. texas requires more than 79,000 signatures from voters who did not participate in either primary. its deadline is monday. among other states, north carolina’s deadline is the end of may, and illinois and florida in mid july. “a third party candidate is a pipe dream,” said republican strategist tony fratto, who worked in bush’s administration and strongly opposes trump. “what’s going to happen is hillary clinton is going to win big. it won’t be close.” ",0
" facebook chief executive mark zuckerberg will meet this week with prominent conservatives in the media, a spokesman said on sunday, to address allegations of political bias at the popular social networking site. some 12 “conservative thought leaders” will join the meeting with zuckerberg on wednesday, a facebook spokesman said. among the invitees are media personality glenn beck, fox news channel’s “the five” co host dana perino and zac moffatt, co founder of targeted victory, a technology company that aims to bring transparency to media buying. facebook came under fire last week when an unnamed former employee told technology news website gizmodo that workers often omitted conservative political stories from the company’s “trending” list of topics. zuckerberg said facebook has “found no evidence that this report is true,” but would continue to investigate. a u.s. senate committee has also opened an inquiry into facebook’s practices. beck, a former fox news host, took to facebook early sunday to say he is going to the meeting in menlo park, california, and  “it would be interesting to look him (zuckerberg) in the eye as he explains.” “while they are a private business and i support their right to run it any way they desire without government interference,” beck said, “it would be wonderful if a tool like face book [sic] independently chose to hold up freedom of speech and freedom of association as a corporate principle.” on friday, facebook outlined its “trending topics” guidelines in its media relations section and stated that reviewers are neither allowed nor advised to discriminate against sources.  facebook, now valued at around $350 billion, has become a bigger source of news for its more than 1 billion daily active users. sixty three percent of users, or 41 percent of all u.s. adults, say they get news from the site, according to a study last year by the pew research center and the knight foundation.

" puerto rico’s newly created federal oversight board set an oct. 14 deadline for the island’s governor to draft a fiscal turnaround plan on friday, as its first public meeting was disrupted by angry protesters. the board asked governor alejandro garcia padilla to present a plan laying out his vision for stabilizing puerto rico, which is grappling with $70 billion in debt, a 45 percent poverty rate and a decade long recession.  the seven member board, created under the puerto rico rescue law known as promesa, was appointed on aug. 31 by president barack obama and legislators. it will have broad powers to manage puerto rico’s finances and facilitate debt restructuring talks with creditors. the board met for the first time on friday in manhattan, electing jose carrion iii as chairman. carrion, one of four native puerto ricans on the panel, is an insurance executive and past chairman of puerto rico’s workers compensation board. “we’re working as quickly as possible, and we’re establishing the procedures as transparently as possible,” carrion told reporters after the meeting, which lasted less than 30 minutes. it is unclear what impact garcia padilla’s fiscal turnaround plan will have. the unpopular governor is not seeking a second term in the nov. 8 election, and the front runner for his seat, a member of an opposition party, has different views on how to right puerto rico’s ship, including by shrinking government and avoiding the debt defaults garcia padilla has initiated over the last year.  garcia padilla, in a statement late on friday, called carrion’s leadership of the board a positive step. “in this process, we will try to make the board understand that, for the recovery to be real, it must deal with the fiscal aspects, while protecting the economic ones,” garcia padilla said. protesters inside the auditorium interrupted the meeting, shouting profanities and likening the board to a form of “slavery.”  “shame on all of you,” yelled one protester before being thrown out. “stop pillaging puerto rico.”  the board on friday also voted to include most major puerto rican entities as “covered entities” under its oversight, including puerto rico itself, its public pension systems, its highway, water and electric authorities and sales tax authority cofina.  the board voted to request financial information from garcia padilla including weekly cash flow reports, monthly reports on revenues and tax collection efforts and monthly payroll reports.

" two of north carolina’s congressional districts were racially gerrymandered in a 2011 redistricting and must be redrawn within two weeks, a u.s. appeals court panel ruled on friday. the order written by fourth circuit court of appeals judge roger gregory bars elections in the majority black districts, the 1st and the 12th, until the new maps are approved. north carolina congressional primaries are scheduled for march 15 “this court finds that congressional districts 1 and 12 as drawn in the 2011 congressional redistricting plan are unconstitutional,” gregory wrote. the ruling said race had been the main factor when the republican controlled legislature redrew the boundaries and state lawmakers were not justified in using that benchmark. three voters filed suit in 2013 to invalidate the districts. both are represented by democrats, with g.k. butterfield in the 1st, and alma adams in the 12th. state senator bob rucho and house member david lewis, who guided the redistricting plan through the legislature, were quoted on the raleigh news and observer website as saying they would appeal the ruling by the three judge panel.

" when it comes to trade policy, hillary clinton is taking heat from all sides. at the democratic national convention this week, where clinton will formally accept her party’s presidential nomination, opposition to trade deals was plastered on buttons, scrawled on signs and chanted by delegates. many are worried by her past support of 1994 north american free trade agreement and the trans pacific partnership, which is still awaiting congressional approval. things are unlikely to get any easier for her. clinton has said her stance on trade has evolved, that she now opposes tpp because it does not do enough to protect jobs and that she wants changes in nafta, the trade deal her husband, bill clinton, signed during his presidency. but that allows her republican opponent, donald trump, to question her credibility, painting clinton’s evolving position as a desperate attempt to catch up with his tough stance. trump has vowed to force canada and mexico to renegotiate nafta, labeling it a job killer. the real estate developer has also said he would pull the united states out of the 12 nation tpp. even among the democrats there are doubts about clinton’s resolve, particularly among supporters of her former democratic rival, bernie sanders, the u.s. senator from vermont whose opposition to trade deals featured prominently in his speeches during the democratic primary season. the concern about trade was on display at the convention during a speech delivered on wednesday night by clinton’s running mate, tim kaine, a u.s. senator from virginia who once supported tpp. delegates waved anti tpp placards as kaine spoke, even though he changed his position after joining clinton’s ticket. larry cohen, a senior adviser to sanders, said trade was “absolutely” a danger for clinton in the race against trump, saying she had to show her commitment to opposing it and not just “make pronouncements.” “the trump campaign is smart enough that they will exploit this issue,” cohen said. sanders supporters have said they intend to keep fighting tpp through the november election via a new group called “our revolution” that is dedicated to championing issues that sanders pushed on the campaign trail. the frustration that a post recession recovery has failed to translate into better wages and opportunities for million of working americans has become one of the leading themes of the 2016 presidential campaign. a reuters/ipsos poll taken in march showed that 65 percent of democrats and 70 percent of republicans believed that trade cost some u.s. jobs even though many also agreed that trade helps to keep the costs of goods low. richard trumka, president of the afl cio labor federation, told reuters that clinton has told all of the major unions that endorsed her that she wanted to re work nafta, echoing similar comments by dennis williams, president of the united auto workers union. trumka said clinton’s campaign has told him that she would take “a whole new approach” on trade and he said he was convinced that he could trust her on the issue. “she’s not giving lip service to it. she’s committed to it,” he said. consulted about clinton’s talks with unions regard nafta, a senior mexican government official said the tpp already provided the united states with a platform to strengthen the rights of workers compared to nafta, although u.s. union activists say the new pact weakens rather than strengthens workers’ protection. “they have the solution in their hands, if they back it,” the official said, noting congress had yet to ratify the tpp. the official added that it would be in mexico’s interests to strengthen the rules of origin in tpp that determine which country a product comes from, but sometimes allow foreign components in it. he cautioned, however, that re opening trade deals was a highly complex undertaking. morris fiorina, a political science professor at stanford university, said clinton should try to address workers’ concerns but avoid a wholesale dismissal of free trade. “were i advising her i’d suggest she try to thread the needle   explain that free trade has great benefits for the country as a whole, but past and pending agreements do not adequately recognize and compensate the losers. she will remedy that failure,” fiorina said. however, such nuanced approach may prove self defeating in the light of trump’s challenge and internal dissent. robin biro, a field director for the democratic party in atlanta and a clinton supporter, said tpp was a make or break issue for clinton to attract democrats who voted for sanders in the primary. “she’s only going to get the support of the bernie people if she comes out strongly on that issue,” biro said.

" the u.s. interior department on monday finalized a contentious rule to protect streams and forests from the impact of coal mining, one of the obama administration’s last major environmental regulations that the incoming trump administration is likely to target. the stream protection rule, which the coal industry strongly opposes, updates 33 year old regulations with stronger requirements for responsible surface coal mining.       the interior department says the rule will protect 6,000 miles of streams and 52,000 acres of forests over the next two decades. “this updated, scientifically modern rule will make life better for a countless number of americans who live near places where coal is being mined,” said joseph pizarchik, director of the interior department’s office of surface mining reclamation and enforcement, which crafted the rule.  pizarchik said his office received over 150,000 public comments on the proposal. the stream protection rule requires companies to avoid mining practices that could pollute streams and drinking water sources, restore streams, and promise to return mined areas to their original form. it also requires mining companies to replant these areas with native trees and vegetation in certain cases. the rule also requires testing and monitoring of streams near coal mines before, during and after drilling to ensure that miners can detect increased levels of pollution.  industry groups like the national mining association have been vocal opponents of the proposal, saying it places too much of a burden on mining companies. the rule is likely to be reversed by president elect donald trump, who said that in his early days in office he would reverse a number of regulations targeting the coal industry, which he has promised to revive.  the republican majority congress could use the congressional review act to block the rule with a simple majority vote. trump would likely not veto it. republican senator shelley moore capito, who represents coal mining state west virginia, called the stream protection rule a “last ditch effort” by the obama administration to burden her state’s struggling coal industry. “the decision by voters last month makes today’s announcement by the office of surface mining an exercise in futility,” capito said in a statement. “working with president elect trump and our republican congressional majority, i am confident that we will be able to use the congressional review act to stop this rule from taking effect.” ",0

" the u.s. government on friday gave companies an extra year to comply with an obama era regulation meant to crack down on corporations that try to minimize their u.s. tax bills by shifting profits abroad to countries with lower tax rates. the regulation, known in corporate tax circles as the “385 rule,” is intended to combat a tax avoidance technique called earnings stripping, in which multinational corporations transfer taxable income from a u.s. subsidiary to a foreign affiliate in the guise of tax deductible interest payments on internal debt.   the rule, which treasury secretary steven mnuchin is now reviewing as part of the trump administration’s push for deregulation, seeks to eliminate the incentive for earnings stripping by reclassifying certain loans as equity under section 385 of the u.s. tax code. the change converts tax deductible interest payments employed by the schemes into taxable stock dividends. finalized last october, the regulation required corporations to file documentation on their internal loans with the irs by a january 2018 deadline. in a public notice issued on friday, the treasury and internal revenue service pushed the deadline back to january 2019.

" republican u.s. senator mike enzi introduced on tuesday a resolution allowing for the repeal of president barack obama’s signature health insurance program, which provides coverage to millions of americans, enzi’s office said in a statement. the move by the senate’s budget committee chairman on the first day of the new congress set in motion the republican majority’s promise to repeal the 2010 affordable care act, known as obamacare, as its first major legislative item. republicans have said the repeal process could take months and that developing replacement health insurance plans could take years. more than 20 million previously uninsured americans gained health coverage through obamacare. coverage was extended by expanding the medicaid program for the poor and through online exchanges where consumers can receive income based subsidies. republicans have launched repeated courtroom and legislative efforts to dismantle the law, criticizing it as government overreach. democrats have scoffed at republicans’ plans, accusing them of never having united around a replacement strategy.  the republicans are using a budget resolution to provide for obamacare’s repeal, allowing them to act without any democratic votes. budget resolutions require a simple majority to pass in the senate, instead of the 60 votes normally required to clear procedural hurdles. there are 52 republicans in the 100 seat chamber.  the budget resolution contains so called reconciliation instructions, directing committees to dismantle obamacare as part of reconciling taxes and spending with the budget blueprint   and to report back to the budget committee by jan. 27. a senate vote on the resolution could come next week, with action in the house of representatives expected to follow. but the repeal process won’t be complete until the committees finish the reconciliation procedure and votes are taken on their work. “these instructions to committees are provided to facilitate immediate action on repeal, with the intent of sending legislation to the new president’s desk as soon as possible,” the statement from enzi’s office said. u.s. president elect donald trump repeatedly vowed during last year’s presidential campaign to repeal obamacare.

" police on wednesday identified a headless female torso washed ashore in copenhagen as that of swedish reporter kim wall, who they believe was killed by a danish inventor on board his home made submarine. wall, who was researching a story on inventor peter madsen, went missing after he took her out to sea in his 17 metre (56 foot) submarine on aug. 10. he denies killing her, saying she died in an accident. announcing the results of tests on the torso, discovered by a passing cyclist on monday, police spokesman jens moller said it had suffered damage suggesting  an attempt to make sure air and gas inside should leave the body so that it would not rise from the seabed . he added:  there was also some metal attached to the body, allegedly also to make sure the body would sink to the bottom.  the arms, legs and head had been sawn from the body. analysis showed a match with wall s dna, which the police had gathered from a toothbrush and a hairbrush, and with blood found in the submarine, moller said. police still do not know the cause of death, and divers are searching for more body parts. madsen, 46, is charged with manslaughter, which carries a sentence of between five years and life in prison. his lawyer  betina hald engmark told reuters he was maintaining his innocence and sticking to his account that wall s death was accidental. the macabre case has riveted swedish and danish media, and made headlines around the world.  it is with boundless sadness and dismay we received the message that the remains of our daughter and sister kim wall have been found,  wall s mother ingrid wall said on facebook.  during the horrendous days that have passed since kim disappeared, we have received countless evidence of how loved and appreciated she was, both as a person and friend and as a professional journalist. from all corners of the world comes proof of kim as a person who made a difference.  madsen has told a court that following the alleged accident, he  buried  wall at sea   changing his initial statement to police that he dropped her off alive in copenhagen. a day after taking wall out on his uc3 nautilus submarine, the inventor was rescued after the vessel sank. police found nobody else on board. the submarine is one of three constructed by madsen and one of the largest privately built ones in the world. it can carry eight people and weighs 40 tonnes when fully equipped.  madsen was already well known in denmark as an entrepreneur and aerospace engineer, as well as for his submarines. he founded the association copenhagen suborbitals, with the goal of sending a person into space in a home built rocket, and wrote a blog under the nickname  rocket madsen .  he is not violent, he does not drink, does not do drugs,  thomas djursing, who wrote a book about him, told danish tabloid b.t. earlier this month.  on the other hand, he quarrels with everyone and i have argued with him too. but that is how it often is with people who are deeply driven by a passion.  wall, 30, was a freelance journalist whose work had appeared in harper s magazine, the guardian, the new york times, foreign policy, the south china morning post, the atlantic and time.  originally from sweden, she held degrees from new york s columbia university and the london school of economics and was based between new york and beijing. she had written about topics ranging from gender and social justice to pop culture and foreign policy, according to her linkedin profile. she had also received training in hostile environments and emergency first aid, she said on the profile. her mother said she had uncovered stories all over the world.  she gave a voice to the weak, the vulnerable and marginalized people. that voice would have been needed for a long, long time. now it won t be so.

" u.s. chief justice john roberts on monday described as bizarre the legal process used by companies to challenge competitors’ patents as the supreme court heard a case involving a vehicle speedometer that alerts drivers if they are driving too quickly. the eight justices heard an appeal filed by cuozzo speed technologies llc, whose speedometer patent was invalidated in a u.s. patent and trademark office review board procedure after being challenged by gps device maker garmin ltd in 2012. the issue before the justices during a one hour argument in the case was whether the u.s. government has made it too easy for companies to pursue challenges to the patents of other companies.  new jersey based cuozzo challenged the board’s action in federal court, and an appeals court last year upheld the agency’s action. cuozzo then asked the supreme court to reverse the appellate decision. garmin is no longer involved in the case. roberts was the most outspoken critic among the eight justices of the current system in which companies can adopt a dual track strategy by challenging patents simultaneously in federal court and through the agency review board. roberts described the system as a “bizarre way to ... decide a legal question” and a “very extraordinary animal in legal culture to have two different proceedings addressing the same question.” justice stephen breyer appeared more sympathetic to the patent office. he said the 2011 law that set up the review board procedure may have intended to counter criticism that the patent office issues “too many patents that shouldn’t have been issued in the first place.” so called patent trolls, entities that hold patents only for the purpose of suing firms seeking to develop new products, have benefited from that generosity. breyer indicated that the patent office views the law as allowing a second bite at the question of whether a patent should have been issued. breyer called it a “partial groundhog day statute,” referring to the 1993 film “groundhog day” in which bill murray’s character repeatedly re lives the same day. companies that are frequent targets of patent suits, including apple inc and google inc, have turned to the patent office procedure, known as “inter partes review” (ipr), to try to fight off patent challenges. google and apple joined court papers backing the patent office. cuozzo told the justices that in nearly 85 percent of cases some or all of the patents challenged were canceled. a ruling is due by the end of june.

" a syrian man living in germany was jailed for three and a half years on wednesday for his part in the kidnapping of a u.n. peacekeeper near damascus four years ago. the man, who was not named, was found guilty of being an accessory to the abduction, according to a statement from the german court that tried him which did not go into details on what he did. the u.n. peacekeeper, who served in the demilitarized zone between syria and israel on the golan heights, was kidnapped in feb. 2013, the higher regional court in the southwestern german city of stuttgart said.  prosecutors had in january 2016 identified the syrian man as suliman a. s. under german privacy laws and said they suspected him of being a member of the islamic militant nusra front group. they said the group had demanded a ransom from the united nations, the canadian government and the peacekeeper s family in exchange for his release. the court did not give his nationality. the u.n. peacekeeper eventually escaped eight months after his abduction, the court said. it said there was not enough evidence to conclude that nusra front was behind the kidnapping nor that the syrian man was a member of the militant group.  the accused was found guilty under the code on international criminal law of being an accessory to a war crime against a peacekeeping mission that involved kidnapping for ransom, three counts of attempted robbery by blackmail and grievous unlawful detention,  the court wrote in a statement.

" many of the immigration initiatives launched by the trump administration in recent weeks target one kind of migrant: children. the measures are aimed at expelling young people already in the united states illegally and preventing new ones from crossing into the country.      some of the policy shifts have generated headlines, including trump’s decision in september to end the deferred action for childhood arrivals program, or daca. that measure, put in place by former president barack obama in 2012, allowed nearly 800,000 young people brought to the united states illegally as children the ability to live, work and study in the country without fear of deportation.     other proposals and actions have received far less attention. the trump administration has recently intensified scrutiny of abused and neglected foreign minors applying to stay in the united states. it is seeking to restrict who qualifies for special protections granted to children crossing the border alone. and it is stepping up prosecutions of adults who paid smugglers to bring unaccompanied kids to the united states.  the white house also announced this fall it will end a program allowing central american minors to apply for u.s. asylum while still living abroad. at the same time, the administration is exploring ways to scrap legal protections that limit how long and under what conditions children can be held in immigration detention centers. in response to questions about the changes in immigration policy focused on children, the white house said that relevant agencies were reviewing ways to help “law enforcement professionals to do their jobs and keep the country safe.” (for a graphic on trump policies targeting young immigrants, see: tmsnrt.rs/2zat2bk)   trump came to office promising to crack down on immigration. that message grew stronger this week in the wake of a terrorist attack in new york by a 29 year old immigrant awarded a green card through a visa lottery program the president has now vowed to end. some of his messaging on child immigrants also reflects security concerns. in a speech in long island in july, trump called out “alien minors” as responsible for gang related killings in the united states.  “these are animals,” he said of members of the notorious central american gang ms 13. in addition, the administration says it wants to prevent children from undertaking perilous journeys to the united states and eliminate fraud from programs for young immigrants. “the president wants to stop the incentives for vulnerable children to come here illegally,” attorney general jeff sessions said in a speech in texas in october. in another speech last month, he blamed “dirty immigration lawyers” for encouraging clients to game the process. some immigration advocates see the president’s focus on young border crossers differently. children are perceived sympathetically by the public and have more legal protections than other immigrants, giving authorities less flexibility to deport them, they say. it is “in the administration’s interest to paint unaccompanied children as gang bangers and not as asylum seekers fleeing violence and abuse,” said american civil liberties union attorney michael tan. “the administration wants the public to perceive these children as monsters and not people deserving of refuge.” president trump is not the first president to try to crack down on minors crossing the border illegally. obama prioritized the removal of young immigrants after the number of unaccompanied minors apprehended at the u.s. mexico border peaked at more than 68,000 in 2014, most of them from violence torn central america.   trump campaigned on a promise to toughen enforcement further, saying obama’s policies had failed. after he took office early in 2017, apprehensions of unaccompanied minors dropped sharply, to a low of just over 990 in april from more than 4,400 in january. but the number of arrests has begun rising again, with nearly 3,000 unaccompanied minors caught in august, according to government data.  one target of the administration is a legal agreement dating back to 1997 that bars the government from holding child immigrants for long periods.  the so called flores settlement addressed what advocates said were harsh conditions for kids held in immigration detention facilities. to settle a class action lawsuit, the government agreed to release minors quickly to adult relatives or licensed childcare programs, or to put them in the “least restrictive” setting possible if other options were not available. faced with 2014 surge in illegal crossings, the obama administration fought broad legal interpretations of the agreement in court to make it easier to detain families. the trump white house now wants to scrap it altogether. an internal memo dated sept. 8 written by the department of homeland security (dhs) and reviewed by reuters called the two decade old legal agreement “unworkable,” and presented four options to fight or end it. among them: dhs could ask a federal court to dissolve the flores deal, a move the memo acknowledged could prove difficult given past rulings that have bolstered the agreement. a dhs spokesperson said the agency would not comment on “internal working documents.” the administration is focused not just on stopping illegal border crossings by children but also on limiting their ability to stay once they reach the united states. one of its targets is sijs, or special immigrant juvenile status, a program for foreign minors who have been abused, abandoned or neglected.  to qualify, children have to prove their mistreatment in u.s. family court, after which they are protected from deportation and allowed to apply for green cards. sijs applications ballooned following the 2014 surge in unaccompanied minors. the program’s numbers hit 19,475 in the 2016 fiscal year, a more than 1,000 percent increase from 1,646 in fiscal year 2010. the white house and immigration hard liners in congress say lawyers have taken advantage of the program by using it for kids who are not in the kind of peril the statute was intended to address. chief among their complaints is that children abandoned by one parent can apply for sijs even if another parent is providing adequate care. the administration is already taking steps to limit the program. immigration attorneys say government scrutiny of sijs petitions has increased, slowing the approval process and leaving kids in limbo. approvals from april to june totaled 1,862, down more than 50 percent from the previous three month period, according to data from u.s. citizenship and immigration services (uscis).  uscis acknowledged that it has stepped up scrutiny of petitions “to ensure that they meet criteria for approval.” but the agency stressed that the majority of applications are still approved.  from january through june of this year 5,671 sijs petitions were approved while 403 applications were denied. meanwhile pending applications are ballooning, totaling 22,745 through june, as new petitions grow.  the delays are creating confusion for young immigrants such as 20 year old drucilla. she says her mother neglected her after bringing her to the united states illegally from jamaica when she was three years old following her father’s murder. drucilla eventually moved in with an aunt in new york and applied for sijs last year in order to stay in the country. drucilla, who asked only be identified by her first name, said she is nervous about the outcome of her case after u.s. officials recently requested additional documents to substantiate her claims. “growing up, nothing was ever in my control,” she said. “i have a lot of anxiety.” see how the administration’s actions

" japan will delay a decision to develop a new advanced fighter jet, four sources said, as military planners struggle to settle on a design and officials splash out on new u.s. equipment such as ballistic missile interceptors and f 35 stealth planes. faced with a growing military threat from north korea and increased activity by chinese air force jets over the east china sea, japan is under pressure to improve its defenses on two fronts. any delay to the new fighter, known as the f 3, will raise a question mark over the future of what could be one of the world s most lucrative upcoming military contracts, estimated at more than $40 billion to develop and deploy.  a decision after the first half of 2018 would be too late for it to be included as a core program in a new five year defense equipment plan beginning april 2019 that japan will reveal at the end of next year.        the direction is for the f 3 decision to be put back,  said one the sources who have knowledge of the discussion. the people who spoke to reuters asked not to be identified because they are not authorized to talk to the media. they said the decision, on whether to forge ahead as a domestic program or seek international collaboration, would now likely come after 2018.          regarding the f 3 decision, including whether we will delay a choice, we have haven t come to any conclusion,  a spokeswoman for the ministry of defence acquisition technology & logistics agency said. analysts estimate developing the f 3 could cost $40 billion, a figure described another source as an  initial cost.   with a defense budget of around $50 billion that has increased in the past few years at just under an annual 1 percent, that outlay, even spread out over years of development, represents a major undertaking.  it would come at a time when japan is spending a record amounts on u.s. equipment, including lockheed martin corp s f 35 jet, raytheon defense missiles and boeing co and textron inc s tilt rotor osprey troop aircraft.  in 2013, japan procured 118 billion yen ($1 billion) of equipment through the u.s. government s foreign military sales (fms) system. by last year, that outlay had quadrupled to 486 billion yen. president donald trump in tokyo last week called on prime minister shinzo abe to purchase additional u.s. made weapons as his administration pushes washington s allies to contribute more to their joint defense.     for now, that defense is focused on countering the threat posed by north korean ballistic missiles and nuclear weapons.  japan s defense forces, however, want the f 3 to counter growing chinese air power in the skies over the western pacific and east china sea where tokyo and beijing are locked in a territorial dispute. japanese fighters scrambled a record 806 times to intercept chinese planes in the year that ended march 31.  a second role for the yet to be built fighter is to reinforce japan s defense industry by giving mitsubishi heavy industries (mhi) and its suppliers their first fighter jet program since japan built its f 2 fighter two decades ago.  mitsubishi heavy, the maker of the world war two era zero fighter, in january 2016 tested a prototype jet, the atd x. developed for around $350 million, it was seen as the first step toward a new homegrown frontline stealth fighter.  while support for a domestic only program is strong among some government officials, other bureaucrats are worried about the potentially enormous expense of developing components from scratch. they support international collaboration to share costs with overseas partners and tap their technology.   what we have now is a flying box  without all the systems that constitute a fighter such as weapons and sensors, said another of the sources.  possible overseas partners include bae systems, a leading designer of the high altitude eurofighter interceptor backed by the british government, f 35 builder lockheed martin and boeing, maker of the f 18 strike fighter. all have responded to initial requests for information from ministry of defence overseeing f 3 plans.

" south african veteran politician and anti apartheid activist nkosazana dlamini zuma, a leading contender to take over as head of the ruling anc in december, will be sworn in as a member of parliament next week, a senior party official said on friday. dlamini zuma, the ex wife of current anc leader and south african president jacob zuma, does not hold a top position and could use a seat in parliament to raise her profile ahead of the party s december leadership conference.   she is going to be sworn in,  anc secretary general gwede mantashe was quoted as saying by the local ewn news network. the former health and foreign affairs minister s main opponent in the anc leadership race is expected to be deputy president cyril ramaphosa, a trade unionist turned business tycoon whom many investors would prefer to see running a country with serious economic challenges. dlamini zuma is pushing for a more radical redistribution of wealth from whites to blacks, a policy that appeals to many poor people who resent the stark racial inequality that persists 23 years after the end of apartheid. the next head of the anc will be the party s presidential candidate in 2019 general elections.

" the leader of egypt s muslim brotherhood movement, mohamed badie, lost his appeal on wednesday against a life sentence for his role in violent clashes during political turmoil in 2013, judicial sources said. the judgment by the court of cassation against the sentence, handed out in 2016, cannot be appealed. badie, 74, was convicted for his role in violence that broke out in the suez canal city of ismailia days after the army, led by then general abdel fattah al sisi, toppled president mohamed mursi, a member of the brotherhood, following mass demonstrations against him.  sisi was elected president the following year. in the same case, the court on wednesday also upheld life sentences against seven other people and handed 10 year sentences to 39 and three year sentences to 19 others. they were charged with killing three people and attempting to kill 16 others, thuggery, and vandalizing public property among other offences, related to the clashes in ismailia in july 2013. authorities outlawed the brotherhood after mursi was ousted, and arrested thousands of its supporters. they also dissolved its freedom and justice party, which mursi led. mass life and death sentences have been common since then in what rights groups call an unprecedented crackdown by the government of sisi, who promised during campaigning for the presidency to wipe out the brotherhood. badie has also been sentenced to life in eight other cases, only one of which has been confirmed. two were canceled, two are pending appeal and three the subject of retrials.

" republican presidential candidate ted cruz said on friday he would make lifting tax and regulatory burdens a priority if elected president and protect the small banks he said were being hurt by stricter bank regulations. cruz, who is running to become the party’s 2016 nominee in the nov. 8 presidential election, targeted the dodd frank regulatory reform law as enabling the nation’s large banks. “the big banks have all gotten bigger,” cruz said in a cnbc interview. cruz has said he would not bail out big banks if they failed again, as the did during the 2007 8 financial crisis triggered by faulty mortgage lending practices. “the people that have been hammered are the little guys,” he said. “it’s the community banks, it’s the small financial institutions that are going out of business at a record pace.” the lawyers and lobbyist for giant banks were “in the room” with the democratic senators who wrote dodd frank because they could absorb the cost of that while the little banks could not, cruz said. cruz said the nation’s tax structure is helping strangle u.s. economic growth and he would try to scale back taxes including corporate and death taxes. cruz has advocated a flat tax rate, which he acknowledged would be difficult to enact. cruz said he would also try to achieve monetary stability and end the “roller coaster” with the u.s. dollar. the u.s. senator from texas told cnbc that a higher minimum wage would cost u.s. jobs and that setting minimum wage should be left up to states. raising the federal minimum wage has been a cornerstone of the democratic presidential candidates hillary clinton and bernie sanders, although the two disagree on how much it should be raised from the current $7.25. republicans generally do not embrace a high minimum wage and front runner donald trump has embraced a lower federal rate.

" german voters are punishing the pro business free democrats (fdp) for walking out of three way coalition talks last month as a poll showed on thursday support for the party falling and the popularity of its leader christian lindner tumbling. the fdp in mid november quit exploratory talks to form a coalition government with chancellor angela merkel s conservatives and the environmentalist greens. lindner said back then it was better not to govern than to govern the wrong way. some observers speculated that the fdp had planned the move well in advance to boost its standing among voters from the center right political spectrum and to show the party puts policy principles before power. but the monthly deutschlandtrend survey, conducted by infratest dimap pollster for ard public broadcaster, showed that support for the fdp fell 3 percentage points to 9 percent, making it the smallest party in parliament. merkel s conservatives gained 2 percentage points to 32 percent, the social democrats (spd) were unchanged at 21 percent. the far right alternative for germany stood at 13 percent, followed by the greens with 11 percent and the left party with 10 percent. the popularity of fdp leader lindner plunged 17 percentage points to only 28 percent. merkel s popularity fell 3 percentage points to 54 percent, her lowest level in the survey since october 2016. the list of germany s most popular politicians was topped by spd foreign minister sigmar gabriel who shot up 8 percentage points to 65 percent. greens co leader cem ozdemir came in second with an approval rating of 57 percent.

" the senate environment and public works committee on wednesday approved four nominees to key posts at the environmental protection agency, including one appointee with ties to the chemical industry who will head the agency’s office of chemical safety. senator tom carper, the top democrat on the committee, said two of the nominees were of “grave concern”: bill wehrum, nominated for assistant administrator for the office of air and radiation, and michael dourson to head up the office of chemical safety and pollution prevention. carper called dourson “one of the most troubling nominees i have ever considered during my time on this committee.”  senator james inhofe of oil producing oklahoma, the panel’s senior republican, praised the passage of the nominees and urged the full senate to quickly confirm them so they can “improve public health within the scope of the epa’s authority.” republicans say the epa under former president barack obama overstepped its authority to regulate. scott pruitt, president donald trump’s epa administrator, has said the agency had an “activist agenda” under former president barack obama. pruitt has worked to do away with regulations pushed through by the obama administration, and has proposed scrapping the landmark clean power plan that sought to curb emissions linked to climate change. pruitt sued the agency more than a dozen times when he was oklahoma’s attorney general.   jeff holmstead, a former head of the epa air and radiation office under former president george w. bush, said wehrum is the “ideal person to shepherd administrator pruitt’s reforms through the regulatory process.”  environmentalists called on the full senate to reject the nominees. “all four of these nominees, especially wehrum and dourson, would accelerate scott pruitt’s mission to dismantle the epa from the inside,” said sara chieffo, vice president for government affairs at the league of conservation voters. the other nominees approved by the panel are matthew leopold for assistant administrator for the office of general counsel, and david ross, for the office of water.

" german chancellor angela merkel said she has no regrets about her 2015 decision to open the country s borders to hundreds of thousands of refugees and added she will not be deterred from campaigning by angry hecklers. in an interview with the welt am sonntag newspaper on sunday, merkel denied she had made any mistakes with her open door policy even though the arrival of a million refugees over the last two years from syria and iraq opened deep rifts in her conservative party and depressed its support.    four weeks before the sept. 24 election, an emnid opinion poll on sunday showed merkel s conservatives would win 38 percent, or 15 points ahead of the center left social democrats (spd). that is up from 32 percent in february but well below the 41.5 percent her party won in the last election in 2013.  i d make all the important decisions of 2015 the same way again,  merkel said.  it was an extraordinary situation and i made my decision based on what i thought was right from a political and humanitarian standpoint.  those kinds of extraordinary situations happen every once in a while in a country s history,  she added.  the head of government has to act and i did.  her decision to open the borders contributed to a surge in support for the far right alternative for germany (afd) party, which pollsters say could win up to 10 percent in the september election. merkel, seeing a fourth term, has had to contend with loud and sustained heckling from demonstrators strongly opposed to her refugee policies so far on the campaign trail. the volume and intensity of the protests have been especially strong in her home region in formerly communist eastern germany. but the 63 year chancellor said she would not be kept away from areas where animosity towards her runs high.  we re a democracy and everyone can freely express themselves in public the way they want,  she said.  it s important that we don t go out of our way to avoid certain areas only because there are a bunch of people screaming.  support for merkel and her party has recovered somewhat after the influx of refugees slowed in 2016 to 280,000 and fell even further to about 106,000 in the first seven months of this year.  merkel said it was unfair that greece and italy were left on their own carrying the full burden of the refugee crisis  simply because of their geography . she added she would not stop pushing for the fair distribution of refugees across the european union.  that some countries refuse to accept any refugees is not on. that contradicts the spirit of europe. we ll overcome that. it will take time and patience but we will succeed.

" two reuters reporters arrested in myanmar had not passed any information to the united nations, the world body said, rejecting a report published in domestic media which suggested that could be the reason for their detention. a report published online by the irrawaddy magazine on tuesday had cited an unnamed source  who has close ties with military intelligence  as saying that the two men had passed photographs obtained during their reporting on violence in the western state of rakhine to the u.n. asked about the report, u.n. spokesman stephane dujarric said on wednesday:  we can confirm that wa lone and kyaw soe oo do not work for the united nations and have not contacted the united nations regarding the situation in rakhine state.  reuters also denied that wa lone, 31, and kyaw soe oo, 27, who have been in detention since dec. 12, had worked with the u.n. or any other organization.  we reject the assertion that wa lone and kyaw soe oo were working with any organization other than reuters,  said a spokeswoman for the news agency, when asked about the irrawaddy report.  they were engaged only in independent, unbiased reporting consistent with the thomson reuters trust principles.  a government spokesman was not immediately available for comment. myanmar authorities have said the two journalists are being investigated over whether they violated the country s colonial era official secrets act. the act carries a maximum prison sentence of 14 years. the two journalists had worked on reuters coverage of the crisis in rakhine, where an estimated 655,000 rohingya muslims have fled from a fierce military crackdown on militants. a number of governments and human rights and journalist groups have criticized myanmar s authorities for holding the pair incommunicado since their arrest, with no access to a lawyer, colleagues and family members.  a senior government spokesman said on wednesday that the pair were in good health and had been well treated. the authorities have previously said that the arrest of the two men did not represent an attack on press freedom.

" speaking as a folksy physician running for virginia governor, democrat ralph northam vowed in a recent campaign ad to fight donald trump on cuts to education funding, environmental protections and health care access.  but northam said he will work with the republican president when it is in the state’s interest. the balancing act puts northam, a moderate lieutenant governor with a low key campaign style, on the front lines of his party’s search for a strategy to exploit trump’s unpopularity in politically divided states such as virginia. he is running against ed gillespie, former chairman of the republican national committee.  the nov. 7 general election in the competitive southern state is seen as a bellwether for next year’s midterm elections, when voters will decide whether republicans should continue to control the u.s. congress and a majority of state governments. after denouncing trump as a “narcissistic maniac” during the primary campaign, northam has since dialed back the vitriol. his emphasis on workforce education and policy matters heeds criticism that democrats lost the white house because voters did not hear what the party stood for.     “the northam strategy is talk trump, but don’t just talk trump,” said stephen farnsworth, a professor of political science at the university of mary washington, noting that northam seeks to broaden his appeal to uncommitted voters. most polls show northam narrowly ahead in a contest democrats consider a must win. virginia is one of only 15 governors’ mansions still held by the party, and its current governor cannot run for re election due to term limits. former democratic president barack obama returned to the campaign trail this week for the first time since leaving office to stump for candidates in virginia and new jersey, the two states with gubernatorial elections this year. without naming trump, he called on voters to send a message by backing candidates like northam.   a recent poll showed nearly one in three likely virginia voters were factoring trump into their decision in the governor’s race, according to a survey from the wason center for public policy at christopher newport university. northam’s supporters overwhelmingly disapproved of trump. distain for the republican president is why niel manson, a 72 year old retired engineer living near the capital city of richmond, became a democrat nine months ago.  yet the former independent called northam wise to make his campaign about more than merely reacting to trump. “there is no benefit in getting in a discussion with trump, because he changes his mind every 24 hours,” manson said. the northam campaign said it has intentionally focused on policies when talking about trump, seeking to draw parallels to gillespie.  northam starts another recent ad highlighting differences between the gubernatorial candidates on climate change. “now ed’s going right along with donald trump as he tries to roll back our clean air and water protections,” the democrat says from a picnic table at a waterfront park.  the strategy works to connect the president to a republican candidate who is not always in lock step with him, said jennifer duffy, who analyzes gubernatorial races for the non partisan cook political report. she said campaigns gearing up for next year’s midterms will learn from virginia whether such messaging sways independents, or motivates democrats to turn out in greater numbers than typical for non presidential years. “this is our first real election to see how these arguments about trump really do impact republican candidates,” duffy said. gillespie’s campaign declined to comment about trump’s impact on the race. the president endorsed gillespie but has not campaigned with him.  vice president mike pence headlined a recent rally for the candidate in southwest virginia’s heavily republican coal country. democratic voter erin siraguse, 34, said she based her support for northam on issues such as his efforts to address affordable housing for teachers around her home in fairfax county in northern virginia. she admires how northam has handled the president’s shadow over this year’s most competitive state race. “lieutenant governor northam has done a wonderful job of talking about trump without mentioning trump,” she said.

" the lower house of brazil s congress will delay a vote on a bill trimming social security benefits until feb. 19, speaker rodrigo maia said on thursday, pushing a decision on the cornerstone of president michel temer s fiscal reforms into an election year. temer had said he hoped for a vote by next week, but he has struggled to rally lawmaker support for the unpopular pension cuts, which many investors consider essential to reining in brazil s surging public debt. brazil s currency, the real, weakened to a seven month low of 3.34 per u.s. dollar and the benchmark bovespa stock index fell 0.8 percent after maia s comments. investors fear that failure to streamline social security could weaken brazil s recovery from a deep economic downturn, forcing the central bank to raise interest rates from an all time low and potentially triggering new sovereign rating downgrades in 2018.  this raises the possibility that the reform will not be approved next year, given political uncertainty surrounding the presidential elections,  said samar maziad, a senior analyst at moody s investors service, calling the delay  credit negative.  finance minister henrique meirelles said he plans to meet next week with credit rating agencies to discuss the fate of the legislation, adding that he hoped it could be enacted by march.  the bill would require brazilians to work longer before retiring and cut generous pensions for public sector employees. lawmakers may be more reluctant to back that as elections approach in october, but maia suggested they would rise to the challenge.  even though 2018 is an election year, the fiscal crisis is so big that it will be possible to get pension reform approved,  he said. temer s last ditch effort to sell the bill this year was cut short on wednesday, when he had to fly to sao paulo for surgery to treat a narrowing of his urethra. his office said the surgery was successful and that he would remain in the hospital until friday to recover. but it forced temer to cancel meetings to muster votes. it became clear this week that temer did not have the three fifths super majority, or 308 votes, needed to pass the bill in the lower house of congress. while ministers were still working to gather more votes, the government s chief whip in the senate stunned the administration on wednesday by saying the vote had to be put off to february.

" china said on wednesday the north korean nuclear issue should be resolved through dialogue, and that military means were not an option, after u.s. president donald trump warned north korea that any u.s. military option would be  devastating . bellicose statements by trump and north korean leader kim jong un in recent weeks have created fears that a miscalculation could lead to action with untold ramifications, particularly since pyongyang conducted its sixth and most powerful nuclear test on sept. 3. speaking at a daily news briefing, chinese foreign ministry spokesman lu kang reiterated that china has all along upheld the aim of the denuclearisation of the korean peninsula and protecting the international nuclear non proliferation system.   at the same we are resolute in working for the protection of the peninsula s peace and stability and uphold a peaceful resolution for the nuclear issue via dialogue and consultation,  lu said.   we have always believed that military means should not be an option to resolve the nuclear issue on the peninsula. because arms cannot resolve the differences and can only cause a bigger disaster. no side can accept this,  he added.  we hope all sides can avoid words and actions that intensify the problem and may cause the situation to continue to escalate.   north korea will be high on the agenda when u.s. secretary of state rex tillerson visits china later this week. while china has been angered by north korea s repeated nuclear and missile tests and has signed up for increasingly tough united nations sanctions against pyongyang, it has also said efforts must be stepped up to resume talks. during a white house news conference on tuesday, trump also said the use of force was not washington s preferred option for dealiong with the north korea s ballistic and nuclear weapons program. despite the increased tension, the united states has not detected any change in north korea s military posture reflecting an increased threat, marine corps general joseph dunford, chairman of the u.s. joint chiefs of staff, said on tuesday. north korean foreign minister ri yong ho on monday accused trump of declaring war on the north and threatened that pyongyang would shoot down u.s. warplanes flying near the korean peninsula after american bombers flew close to it last saturday. ri was reacting to trump s twitter comments that kim and ri  won t be around much longer  if they acted on their threats toward the united states.

" paul wolfowitz, a republican adviser to former u.s. president george w. bush, plans to vote for democrat hillary clinton in the november presidential election despite his “serious reservations”, der spiegel magazine reported on friday. wolfowitz, who served as deputy defense secretary under bush and also as president of the world bank, said he viewed republican presidential candidate donald trump as a security risk because of his admiration of russian president putin and his views on china, the magazine reported. “it’s important to make it clear how unacceptable he is,” the magazine quoted wolfowitz as saying in an interview. wolfowitz joins a long list of republicans who have said they will not vote for trump. “i wish there was a candidate whom i could support enthusiastically. i will have to vote for hillary clinton, although i have serious reservations about her,” he said. a reuters/ipsos poll this week showed that clinton would win the key swing states of florida, ohio and virginia, and have a 95 percent chance of beating trump if the election were held now. wolfowitz rejected a common description of him as a key architect of the 2003 u.s. war against iraq, saying that if he had truly been the architect many things would have gone differently, the magazine reported. wolfowitz said the goal had been to free the country, not occupy it, creating tensions with many iraqis. he also defended the decision to invade iraq, saying it was based on intelligence that later turned out to be faulty. “of course we would have proceeded differently if we had known that saddam hussein was not stockpiling weapons of mass destruction, but was only planning to do so,” he said. “we would not have invaded.” in an interview with vanity fair magazine in may 2003, several months after the invasion, he suggested there were multiple reasons for it, but the bush administration highlighted iraq’s supposed wmd as the justification for the war as the most politically convenient. “for bureaucratic reasons, we settled on one issue, weapons of mass destruction, because it was the one reason everyone could agree on,” he said at the time.

" north korea’s nuclear threat looms large this week over the annual gathering of world leaders at the united nations in new york, where diplomats are eager to hear u.s. president donald trump address the 193 member body for the first time.  north korean diplomats will have a front row seat in the u.n. general assembly for trump’s speech on tuesday morning, which will touch on the escalating crisis that has seen trump and pyongyang trade threats of military action.  despite his skepticism about the value of international organizations and the united nations in particular, trump will seek support for tough measures against north korea, while pressing his “america first” message to the world body. “this is not an issue between the united states and north korea. this is an issue between the world and north korea,” trump’s national security adviser, h.r. mcmaster, said on friday. u.n. secretary general antonio guterres   who, like trump, took office in january   plans to meet separately with “concerned parties,” including north korean foreign minister ri yong ho, on the sidelines of the 72nd general assembly. “the solution can only be political. military action could cause devastation on a scale that would take generations to overcome,” guterres warned on wednesday.  a week ago, the 15 member u.n. security council unanimously adopted its ninth sanctions resolution since 2006 over north korea’s nuclear and ballistic missile programs.  u.s. ambassador to the united nations nikki haley said u.n. sanctions had banned 90 percent of the asian state’s publicly reported exports, saying of pyongyang on friday: “this is totally in their hands on how they respond.” haley told cnn’s “state of the union” program on sunday that washington had “pretty much exhausted” its options on north korea at the security council. ri is due to address the general assembly on friday. some leaders will also push trump not to give up on a 2015 deal curbing iran’s nuclear ambitions in return for a lifting of u.n., u.s. and european sanctions, while israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu said it was time to “fix it   or cancel it.” the foreign ministers of iran, the united states, britain, germany, russia, china and france   the parties to the agreement   are due to meet on wednesday ahead of an october deadline for trump to tell congress if he believes tehran is sticking to what he has described as “the worst deal ever negotiated.” when asked on friday what moscow’s message would be for washington, russia’s u.n. ambassador, vassily nebenzia, said: “stay in the jcpoa (the nuclear deal).” a senior u.n. security council diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity, said: “we are faced with real uncertainties with respect to north korea and it’s a bit dangerous ... to add another source of uncertainty with respect to iran.” iran’s supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei said on sunday his country would not be bullied by the united states and would react strongly to any “wrong move” by washington on the nuclear deal.  iran and north korea will also feature heavily during a ministerial security council meeting on thursday, at the request of the united states, to discuss the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.  while leaders and diplomats are also due to meet on longer running crises including libya, syria, south sudan, mali, central african republic, yemen and iraq, a last minute addition has been myanmar, where the united nations has branded violence against rohingya muslims as “ethnic cleansing.”  britain is due to host a ministerial meeting on monday to seek a way to get myanmar authorities to end a military offensive in the country’s rakhine state that has sent more than 400,000 minority rohingya muslims fleeing to bangladesh. following trump’s announcement that the united states would withdraw from a landmark 2015 global agreement to fight climate change, several high level gatherings are planned on the sidelines of the general assembly to bolster the deal. “climate change is a serious threat,” guterres told reporters. “hurricanes and floods around the world remind us that extreme weather events are expected to become more frequent and severe, due to climate change.” u.s. secretary of state rex tillerson appeared to hold the door open for the united states to remain in the paris climate accord “under the right conditions.” “the president said he is open to finding those conditions where we can remain engaged with others on what we all agree is still a challenging issue,” tillerson said on cbs’ “face the nation” program on sunday.  trump will seek to boost support for reforming the united nations, which he once called “a club for people to get together, talk and have a good time.” the united states is the largest u.n. contributor and trump has complained that washington pays too much. “the united nations, of course, holds tremendous potential to realize its founding ideals, but only if it’s run more efficiently and effectively,” mcmaster said on friday.

" a roadside bomb killed at least seven people on sunday   mostly women farmers   in an area outside the somali capital dominated by islamist insurgents who have defied public protests to end years of violence, residents and the army said. a truck bombing in mogadishu last weekend killed at least 358 people, with 56 people still missing. almost all of the dead were civilians and the attack triggered angry demonstrations in the capital.  sunday s bombing hit a minibus in daniga village about 40 km (25 miles) to the northwest of mogadishu.   we heard a huge crash today and we went to the scene, we saw a ruined minibus and at least seven dead bodies, mostly women. we could not identify some people, they were just pieces of human flesh,  farmer nur abdullahi told reuters by phone. the area of the bombing is close to areas held by al shabaab, the al qaeda linked insurgents who want to overthrow the weak u.n. backed government and impose strict islamic law.   we are scared,  abdullahi said  hundreds of masked militants are everywhere and we anticipate the government will attack here. they also planted mines everywhere and today we pack our clothes to flee.  an army officer said the death toll might be higher.  we know the minibus left afgooye (town) this morning and it was carrying farmers, mostly women,  said captain isa osman of the somali national army.   it was carrying more than 10 people. we cannot get many details because the area is not controlled by government.  after last saturday s attack, the government promised new offensives against the insurgency.  somalia has been riven by civil war since 1991, when clan warlords overthrew a dictator then turned on each other.

" u.s. government officials declined on tuesday to characterize the treatment of myanmar’s rohingya muslims as ethnic cleansing, but listed new measures including targeted sanctions washington is considering to address the crisis. “i’m not in a position ... to characterize it today, but to me this very closely resembles some of the worst kind of atrocities that i’ve seen during a long career,” mark storella deputy assistant secretary of state from the bureau of population, refugees and migration said at a senate hearing, when pressed to say whether he viewed the situation as ethnic cleansing. hundreds of thousands of rohingya muslims have fled myanmar’s rakhine state since security forces responded to rohingya militants’ attacks on aug. 25 by launching a crackdown the united nations has denounced as ethnic cleansing. myanmar, also known as burma, rejects that accusation, insisting action was needed to combat “terrorists” who killed civilians. but it has left the world community counting the cost as international organizations and the government of bangladesh, which has taken in the vast majority of the refugees, race to provide food, water and medical care. many u.s. lawmakers have clamored for a strong u.s. response to the crisis and criticized government leader aung san suu kyi, a nobel peace laureate once hugely popular in washington, for failing to do more. “she’s an impressive person, but she’s not taking on the challenge,” said senator ben cardin, the ranking democrat on the senate foreign relations committee. cardin said he considered the treatment of the rohingya genocide. the state department said on monday that washington is taking steps and considering a range of further actions over myanmar’s treatment of the rohingya, including targeted sanctions under its global magnitsky law. [l2n1mz01t] at the foreign relations committee hearing, patrick murphy, deputy assistant secretary of state for east asian and pacific affairs, said broader sanctions were also being considered, but cautioned that doing so could lessen the u.s. government’s ability to influence the myanmar government to change.

" u.s. president donald trump said on monday he had a  great relationship  with his philippine counterpart, rodrigo duterte, while a white house official said human rights got only a brief mention when the two met on the sidelines of an asian summit. a spokesman for duterte said there was no mention at all of human rights or extrajudicial killings during their conversation.  the meeting between the two presidents was one of the most anticipated at the summit of east and southeast asian leaders in manila, with human rights groups pressing trump to take a tough line on duterte over his bloody war on drugs, in which thousands of people have been killed.  the conversation focused on isis (islamic state), illegal drugs, and trade,  said white house spokeswoman sarah sanders.  human rights briefly came up in the context of the philippines  fight against illegal drugs.  duterte s spokesman, harry roque, told a news conference the philippine president had explained his antidrug policy at length to trump, who  seemed to be appreciative of his efforts.   there was no mention of human rights, no mention of extralegal killings,  he said. a joint statement released later by the white house listed human rights as the third of 14 topics discussed.  the two sides underscored that human rights and the dignity of human life are essential, and agreed to continue mainstreaming the human rights agenda in their national programs to promote the welfare of all sectors, including the most vulnerable groups,  the statement said. they discussed the philippine campaign against crime, including illegal drugs, it said, and  committed to share best practices in the areas of prevention; enforcement, including capacity building and transparency in investigations; and rehabilitation.   more than 3,900 people have been killed in a war on drugs that duterte declared when he took office last year. his government says the police act in self defense, but critics say executions are taking place with no accountability.  we are your ally. we are an important ally,  duterte told trump at the beginning of their talks, according to reporters allowed in to the meeting room. trump replied:  we ve had a great relationship. this has been very successful. and the asean (association of southeast asian nations) conference has been handled beautifully by the president in the philippines.  duterte, who has been called the  trump of the east  for his brash style and provocative language, said last week he would tell the u.s. president to  lay off  if he were to raise accusations of rights violations. trump was criticized in may for praising duterte during a phone call for the  great job  he was doing to counter illegal narcotics. the united states and the philippines, a former u.s. colony, have been strategic allies since world war two. but their relations have been strained by anti u.s. outbursts from duterte and his enthusiasm for better ties with russia and china. however, duterte clearly appears to be getting on better with trump than he did with the american president s predecessor, barack obama. trump and duterte seem to have warmed to each other after meeting for the first time on saturday at an asia pacific economic cooperation (apec) group meeting in vietnam. on sunday, duterte crooned hit filipino love song  ikaw  (you) at a gala dinner for summit leaders in manila, saying it was on  the orders  of trump. one of the song s verses, translated from filipino, begins:  you are the light in my world, a half of this heart of mine .  ladies and gentlemen, i sang uninvited, upon the orders of the commander in chief of the united states,  duterte said later, according to the abs cbn news channel. roque described the relationship between trump and duterte as  warm, friendly and candid.   it s very apparent that both of them have a person who they consider as not a best friend,  he added.   they have similar feelings toward former u.s. president barack obama.   duterte s anger was unleashed last year when obama raised concern about possible human rights abuses in the war on drugs. duterte said obama could  go to hell  and called him a  son of a bitch.

" czech lawmakers voted on wednesday to let police bring fraud charges against andrej babis, the leading candidate to become prime minister in next month s elections. babis, a billionaire businessman and founder of the poll leading ano party, denies allegations that he hid ownership of one of his firms to receive a 50 million czech crown ($2.29 million) eu subsidy meant for small business in 2008. the 63 year old former finance minister has dismissed a police investigation into the case as a ploy by political and business adversaries to chase him out of politics.  you will not silence me, intimidate me, stop me. and you will not get rid of me,  babis told parliament before mps overwhelmingly voted to lift the immunity from prosecution granted to lawmakers. he ended up backing the motion himself, saying he wanted to clear his name, though other ano party deputies boycotted the vote.  so, give me up. i ask you to lift my immunity so that the truth can be revealed,  he told the lower house.  wednesday s decision, backed by 123 to four, does not stop babis from standing in the oct. 20 21 election. but it could dent his support. several potential coalition partners have said they could not work with a prime minister charged with a crime. babis s ano party, a junior member in a social democrat led government, leads opinion polls by a double digit margin   though there have been no major surveys taken since the police requested his immunity be lifted on aug. 10. the party has promised to revamp politics and root out what babis calls mafia like networks of business and political interests. governments led by the traditional parties   the center right civic democrats and the center left social democrats   brought the country into nato and the european union but lost many voters in recent years amid a series of corruption scandals. babis s adversaries argue he got rich in the environment that he now criticizes, often doing business with the state. his agrofert group is the biggest czech private employer with more than 30,000 staff. the subsidy under investigation, was paid for building a conference center near prague called stork nest, before babis entered politics. the police investigation is expected to last well beyond the october vote and babis will win immunity again if reelected to parliament, as expected, which would force the police to ask again for permission to charge him.

" cuba s top diplomat warned the united states on tuesday against taking hasty decisions over alleged incidents that have harmed u.s. embassy staff in havana and urged its authorities to cooperate on the investigation into the mysterious affair. cuban foreign minister bruno rodriguez had called for tuesday s meeting with u.s. secretary of state rex tillerson in washington to discuss the case, which has been threatening the already fragile detente between the two former cold war foes. the highest level meeting to take place between the two countries since u.s. president donald trump took office came 10 days after tillerson said the united states was considering closing its recently re opened embassy in havana.  the foreign minister reaffirmed that the investigation to resolve this matter is still in progress,  the cuban foreign ministry said in a statement, noting that  effective cooperation  of u.s. authorities was essential.   it would be regrettable that a matter of this nature is politicized and that hasty decisions not supported by conclusive evidence and investigation results are taken.  the meeting  took place in a respectful ambiance , the  cuban foreign ministry said. the u.s. state department said the conversation was  firm and frank  and tillerson  conveyed the gravity of the situation and underscored the cuban authorities  obligations to protect embassy staff.  washington earlier this year expelled two cuban diplomats over the alleged incidents, which it says caused symptoms from hearing loss to nausea in u.s. embassy staff and their families in havana, although it has so far not laid blame on cuba. cuba reiterated on tuesday that it  has never perpetrated nor will it ever perpetrate attacks of any kind against diplomats,  and said it had implemented additional measures to protect u.s. personnel since they reported the incidents. the case has brought simmering tensions between the two countries since trump took office to the boil. trump, who in june vowed to partially roll back the detente with cuba agreed by his democratic predecessor, president barack obama, called the communist run nation  corrupt and destabilizing  in his address to the united nations general assembly last week.  he said he would not lift the u.s. trade embargo on the caribbean island until it made  fundamental reforms.  cuba described his comments as  unacceptable and meddling.   cuba s investigation had uncovered  no evidence so far of the cause or the origin of the health disorders reported by the u.s. diplomats,  the country s foreign ministry said. experts agree it is hard to see how any attacks could have been carried out or what the motivation could be. theories abound, from surveillance technology gone awry to a sophisticated acoustic weapon in the hands of cuban american exiles or third party state actors such as russia, iran or north korea, but most flounder. audiologists, for example, have raised doubt over the possibility of whether any sonic weapon exists that can be used covertly to bring about the range of symptoms mentioned by diplomats.

" libya’s u.n. backed government has criticized u.s. president donald trump’s temporary ban on its nationals and those of six other countries entering the united states, which put in question attendance at a high profile conference on libya planned in washington for mid february.   the executive order by trump comes at a time of uncertainty over u.s. policy in libya, which remains mired in the chaos that followed the nato backed 2011 uprising against long time leader muammar gaddafi. the u.n. backed government of national accord (gna), was strongly supported by former u.s. president barack obama’s administration, but has struggled to assert its authority in tripoli and beyond.  factions in eastern libya aligned with a rival government and with powerful military commander khalifa haftar welcomed trump’s election, hoping for more support for their anti islamist stance. trump’s travel ban has angered some libyans, including students studying or planning to study in the united states. gna foreign minister mohammed siyala called it an “unjust decision” that should be reviewed.  “these actions represent racial discrimination on the basis of religion and are incompatible with human rights,” he told local tv station libya’s channel.  authorities in eastern libya declined to comment on the ban for days. a spokesman for the eastern based government said on wednesday however the order “could not be rejected”, given libya’s own institutional confusion. a member of the eastern parliament, youssef al fakhri, said that despite libya’s political and security problems, the measure was “not appropriate”.  the order appeared to put in jeopardy the participation of libyans invited to a feb. 16 conference titled “libya u.s. relations 2017: new vision, hope and opportunities”.  the event, co hosted by the national council on u.s. libya relations, lists libyan speakers including two former prime ministers and the head of the national oil corporation (noc). several speakers are loyal to or connected with eastern based factions. “we are clearly concerned with the risk of denial of entrance to some of our key speakers and participants from libya,” hani shennib, the council’s president, said in an email. “however, we are working diligently with authorities here in the usa and we are hopeful that a resolution to facilitate  entrance of our conference participants will [be] present in the next 2 3 days.” a gna spokesman, ashraf al tulti, told reuters libya’s foreign ministry would request exceptions from the u.s. department of state for libyan attendees.  exceptions to the travel ban can be made on a case by case basis, and diplomatic visas are exempt. tulti, who was invited to attend the washington conference and holds a diplomatic passport, said he was still waiting for a visa. one libyan speaker said she had a visa, but was still investigating whether she would be able to attend. under the order released on friday, travelers from iran, iraq, libya, somalia, sudan, syria and yemen are banned from entering the united states for at least 90 days. homeland security secretary john kelly said some countries “may not be taken off the list anytime soon, if they are countries that are in various states of collapse”.

" a north korean soldier who suffered critical gunshot wounds during a defection dash across the border to south korea has been transferred to a military hospital, a south korean intelligence official said on saturday. the north korean soldier, 24 year old oh chong song, was transferred to the military hospital on friday from a trauma center at ajou university hospital south of seoul, where his treatment for gunshot wounds and pre existing conditions included two major operations.   oh has been transferred to south korea s military hospital and south korea s intelligence services will soon schedule the security questioning process depending on oh s condition,  the intelligence official told reuters. the official, who declined to be identified, also declined to provide a specific schedule for oh s questioning.   oh was shot and badly wounded by his fellow north korean soldiers while fleeing across the border into the south in november.  three south korean soldiers brought oh to safety and he was immediately taken aboard a u.s. black hawk military helicopter and rushed into surgery.  medical staff at the armed forces hospital will continue to provide proper care and treatment for oh,  a south korean defense ministry official. surgeon john cook jong lee accompanied oh, along with a few south korean intelligence services agents and other medical crew, as he was airlifted by a south korean military helicopter to the korean armed forces capital hospital in seongnam, south of seoul.  oh is still recovering from two major surgeries and other minor injuries. he has not gained full strength yet, but his condition has been much stabilized,  said a person familiar with oh s condition, who declined to be identified.

" the u.s. house of representatives intelligence committee said on friday it had invited fbi, nsa and obama administration officials to testify as it restarts its investigation into  alleged russian meddling in the 2016 u.s. election. after stalling over the committee chairman’s ties to president donald trump’s white house and disagreements over who should testify, the bipartisan committee said it sent a letter inviting james comey, director of the federal bureau of investigation, and admiral mike rogers, director of the national security agency, to appear behind closed doors on may 2. a second letter invited three officials who left the government as president barack obama’s administration ended    former cia director john brennan, former director of national intelligence james clapper and former deputy attorney general sally yates   to appear at a public hearing to be scheduled after may 2. the planned hearings are the first the committee has announced since its chairman, republican representative devin nunes, recused himself from the russia investigation on april 6 after receiving information at the white house about surveillance that swept up some information about members of trump’s transition team. echoing trump, nunes suggested that obama’s administration had handled that information incorrectly. nunes remains the committee’s chairman. comey and rogers testified in a public hearing on march 20. at that hearing, comey confirmed for the first time that the fbi was investigating possible ties between trump’s presidential campaign and russia as moscow sought to influence the election. nunes was a supporter of trump’s campaign and a member of his transition team. his decision two days after the public hearing to hold a press conference about the information and discuss it with trump before disclosing it to democrats raised questions about whether he could lead a credible investigation. committee democrats also were angered when nunes scrapped a scheduled public hearing with brennan, yates and clapper. a planned closed hearing with comey and rogers also was put off. the house panel is examining whether russia tried to influence the election in trump’s favor, mostly by hacking democratic operatives’ emails and releasing embarrassing information, or possibly by colluding with trump associates. russia denies the allegations, which trump also dismisses. the senate intelligence committee is conducting a separate, similar investigation. senate investigators currently are interviewing analysts and intelligence agents who prepared public and classified reports in january that concluded that russia had interfered in last year’s election on trump’s behalf, an official familiar with the congressional activity said. at this point they are a long way from scheduling interviews or hearings with any principal witnesses from either the obama or trump administrations, the official said.

" while attention in asia has been distracted by the north korean nuclear crisis in the past year, china has continued to install high frequency radar and other facilities that can be used for military purposes on its man made islands in the south china sea, a u.s. think tank said on thursday. chinese activity has involved work on facilities covering 72 acres (29 hectares) of the spratly and paracel islands, territory contested with several other asian nations, according to the asia maritime transparency initiative of washington s center for strategic and international studies. the report cited satellite images.  the united states and its allies oppose china s building of artificial islands in the south china sea and their militarization, given concerns beijing plans to use them to deny access to strategic routes.  it s completely normal for china to conduct peaceful construction and build essential defense equipment on its own sovereign territory,  china s foreign ministry spokesman lu kang told a regular press briefing on friday, in response to a question about the report.  we believe certain people who have ulterior motives are making mountains out of molehills and stirring up trouble.  the report said that in the last several months china had constructed what appeared to be a new high frequency radar array at the northern end of fiery cross reef in the spratlys. subi reef had seen tunnels completed that were likely for ammunition storage and another radar antenna array and radar domes, the report said. construction on mischief reef included underground storage for ammunition and hangars, missile shelters and radar arrays. smaller scale work had continued in the paracel islands, including a new helipad and wind turbines on tree island and two large radar towers on triton island. it said the latter were especially important as waters around triton had been the scene of recent incidents between china and vietnam and multiple u.s. freedom of navigation operations, which the u.s. navy has used to assert what it sees as its right to free passage in international waters. woody island, china s military and administrative headquarters in the south china sea, saw two first time air deployments  that hint at things to come at the three spratly island air bases farther south,  the report said. at the end of october, the chinese military released images showing j 11b fighters at woody island for exercises, while on nov. 15, amti spotted what appeared to be y 8 transport planes, a type that can be configured for electronic surveillance. the pentagon has conducted several patrols near chinese held south china sea territory this year, even as it has sought china s help in northeast asia to press north korea to give up its nuclear weapons program. on tuesday, u.s. secretary of state rex tillerson  reiterated a call for a  freeze  in china s island building and said it was unacceptable to continue their militarization.

" republican leaders are aiming to send their tax bill to president donald trump for his signature by the end of the year. to do that, negotiators from the u.s. house of representatives and the senate will need to iron out differences between their two versions of the legislation. here are some of the main points they will need to address. the senate bill repeals a provision of the affordable care act, also known as obamacare, that levies a penalty on taxpayers who do not purchase health insurance. the house bill did not repeal the mandate’s penalty but leaders there have indicated they would be open to doing so it if the senate could pass it. the house bill consolidates seven individual income tax rates into four but keeps the top rate at 39.6 percent. the senate version keeps seven brackets and sets the top rate at 38.5 percent.  pass through businesses the house legislation capped at 25 percent the tax rate on 30 percent of pass through business income, with the remaining 70 percent taxed at individual wage rates. the house excluded taxpayers in professional services, who would continue paying individual tax rates on all income. the senate bill leaves all pass through income in the individual system but establishes a deduction for 23 percent of pass through income. the senate version allows those in services professions to use the deduction if their income is less than $250,000 per year, or $500,000 for a married couple. pass through businesses include partnerships and other companies not organized as public corporations, encompassing most american business enterprises from mom and pop concerns to large financial and real estate organizations. the house bill repeals the deduction for medical expenses that exceed 10 percent of a taxpayer’s annual income. the senate version retains the deduction for two years and drops the threshold to 7.5 percent of income. the house bill repeals the individual and corporate alternative minimum taxes, or amt, which are intended to make sure high income taxpayers do not unduly lower their tax liabilities by combining numerous credits and deductions. the senate bill repeals the individual amt but keeps the 20 percent corporate amt. by also cutting the corporate tax rate to 20 percent from 35 percent, some corporations have said this means they would not be able to use popular tax breaks such as the research and development credit. the house bill limited a popular individual tax deduction to interest on home mortgages of $500,000 or less. the senate bill would allow taxpayers to deduct interest on mortgages of $1,000,000 or less. the house bill would allow companies to fully deduct the value of machinery and equipment and other costs for five years. the senate bill allows businesses to do the same but then phases it out over five years.

" president donald trump’s executive order on thursday making it easier for churches to dabble in politics kept faith with his promise to evangelical christians who helped him win the white house, but could end up benefiting his opponents as well. leaders of the u.s. religious left, a rising force of opposition to trump’s hard line stance on immigration and healthcare, said they were poised to benefit from the move, which lifts the risk of religious groups losing their tax exempt status if they advocate for particular candidates. “this is going to backfire on trump,” said the rev. jennifer butler, chief executive of progressive policy group faith in public life. “we are morally outraged at what is going on and we are appalled at the weaponization of religion.” the group plans to mobilize voters who view some of trump’s policies as immoral. while the group does not endorse candidates, those voters in the 2018 midterm elections would back candidates who oppose those policies. trump’s order gives religious groups more liberty to do so without jeopardizing tax exempt status. “we’re going to be mobilizing millions of voters to turn out at the polls and vote their values,” butler said.  sojourners, a washington based progressive christian network that advocates for immigrants and the poor, also believes more of its members will now feel free to speak out against trump’s policies. “i wouldn’t tell people who to vote for but i would tell them what to vote against and this might encourage more churches to speak out against him,” said jim wallis, the group’s founder. “donald trump’s use of racism and racial bigotry is unchristian. his attack on refugees is anti christian.” trump has repeatedly and angrily denied allegations that his policies are racist, calling immigration limits essential for national security. before signing the order, the republican president cited historically black churches and slain civil rights leader martin luther king jr. as drivers of u.s. social progress. evangelical and roman catholic leaders as well as a prominent u.s. rabbi joined trump when he signed the order instructing the internal revenue service to “alleviate the burden of the johnson amendment,” the 1954 law prohibiting organizations with tax free status, including churches, from participating in political campaigns or supporting particular candidates. the move by trump, who appealed to religious conservatives in his 2016 presidential run, was widely praised by religious organizations that felt hemmed in by the law or openly violated it. “we will not allow people of faith to be targeted, bullied or silenced any more,” trump, who criticized the johnson amendment during his campaign, said at the ceremony. rescinding the law would require an act of congress. ralph reed, a longtime leader of the religious right and chairman of the faith & freedom coalition, praised trump’s executive order in a statement, saying it removed a “sword of damocles that has hung over the faith community for decades.” several prominent leaders of the religious left noted that neither republican nor democratic policy stances lined up neatly with any major religion’s teaching and said the move could fracture congregations by encouraging leaders to take sides. “once faith leaders become partisan, it hijacks their moral authority and their impartiality in this hyper partisan environment,” said rabbi jonah pesner, director of the religious action center of reform judaism. the american civil liberties union had threatened a lawsuit to stop the order, but later backed off, saying the most onerous provisions had yet to be enacted and that it fell far short of meeting trump’s pledge to “totally destroy” the johnson amendment. several leaders interviewed said they worried that trump’s move could be unevenly enforced, allowing conservative christian churches to promote political candidates without extending the same exemptions to other views or other denominations. “the biggest religious liberty issue now for me is how christians are going to protect the liberty of muslims,” said wallis, of sojourners. “that’s the top issue, more than whether they have to hire gay people.” ibrahim hooper, spokesman for the council on american islamic relations, said his group would keep urging u.s. imams to speak out on moral issues with political consequences, but would urge them to remain nonpartisan. he wondered if all religious leaders would follow that guidance. “these kind of moves, particularly by this administration, have a vast ocean of unintended consequences,” he said.

" u.s. president barack obama is expected to sign a bill to provide financial incentives to companies developing treatments for the zika virus, a white house spokeswoman said, but the bill passed by the house of representatives on tuesday is insufficient to meet the challenge. “we hope that this legislation encourages private sector partners to address the challenge of zika, but it contains no funding and is ultimately insufficient on its own, since it doesn’t provide the $1.9 billion in funding that our public health experts have said is needed right now to prepare americans for the imminent local transmission of zika in this country,” spokeswoman katie hill said.

" norway said on friday it planned to send an armored battalion near its arctic border with russia and buy more tanks and artillery to respond to growing threats. defence minister ine eriksen soereide did not mention russia as she described her minority government s defense plan, and said she did not see a specific, current military threat. but the nato member and other nearby countries have grown increasingly alarmed about moscow s ambitions, particularly following its annexation of ukraine s crimea region in 2014 and its naval and air force maneuvers in the region.  the security situation has become more challenging and less predictable. this has consequences for how we organize the military,  soereide told journalists. the plan calls for the armored unit   still referred to as a cavalry battalion   to be stationed in the remote porsanger district, in the far north on the edge of a long fjord leading into the barents sea, which also borders russia. it also includes more investment in tanks, artillery and long range precision weapons in the area and other locations further south, together with an extension of the time people have to spend in some national service positions to 16 from 12 months.  we must be able to defend all parts of our country ... this is a clear signal that we have a particular responsibility in the north,  soereide said. the russian embassy in oslo was not immediately available for comment.  norway s minority government will need to get support from other parties to get the proposals through parliament, but there is a broad consensus on strengthening defenses in the arctic north. in june, russia said norway s decision to extend the presence of u.s. marines on its soil would worsen relations and could escalate tensions on nato s northern flank.

" a swiss federal court has dismissed the asylum appeal of a woman convicted in spain of supporting the basque separatist group eta, but said she was now free to remain in switzerland after madrid dropped her sentence. the case of nekane txapartegi, who said she was tortured while in custody in spain before fleeing in 2007, has drawn considerable attention in switzerland, with members of a  free nekane  movement staging rallies in zurich and other cities. the united nations  special rapporteur on torture and amnesty international had also urged swiss authorities not to extradite txapartegi to spain. on friday the swiss court said the asylum issue was no longer relevant because spain s high court had ruled that her sentence   initially 11 years in jail, later reduced to 3 1/2 years   had reached its statute of limitations.  as with every european citizen, ms. txapartegi may stay in switzerland within the rules of free movement,  a spokesman for the state secretariat for migration said. switzerland is not in the european union but eu citizens can settle there provided they are in gainful employment or can prove they have sufficient funds to support themselves. swiss authorities arrested txapartegi in zurich in april 2016 after they discovered she had been living under an assumed name in switzerland since 2009. they agreed in march this year to extradite her but freed her in september after the spanish decision to drop her jail sentence. txapartegi had told swiss authorities she was tortured into confessing support for eta while in spanish custody. the swiss federal office of justice said at the time she  could  not credibly show that she was actually tortured . on friday the swiss court said that, given the conditions prevailing in spain at the time of her arrest, she may well have been subjected to physical and psychological abuse, but said it no longer needed to evaluate her claims. eta, which killed more than 850 people in a decades long campaign to carve out a separate state, effectively ended its armed resistance this year when it surrendered its weapons.

" a newly unveiled presidential contender for mexico s ruling party attacked his main leftist rival on tuesday, accusing him of being obsessed by power, afraid of debate and unable to tackle corruption when he held public office. jose antonio meade, who resigned as finance minister on monday to run for the institutional revolutionary party (pri), sought to discredit former mexico city mayor andres manuel lopez obrador, the early front runner in the july 2018 election.  i m not afraid of andres manuel, i m sure i m going to beat him ... because there s a fundamental difference,  meade told mexican radio.  what he s about is hunger for power, and with me it s about wanting to serve and construct.  graft scandals have battered the pri s credibility under president enrique pena nieto, and senior officials regard meade as a strong candidate because he has avoided the taint of corruption in office   and does not belong to the party. the pri does not begin registering candidates until dec. 3 and will not elect its contender until feb. 18. however, all the indications are that meade will run to replace pena nieto, who is constitutionally barred from seeking re election. lopez obrador, runner up in the past two elections, has spent years railing against graft, which promises to be a key campaign issue. right after meade signaled his intention to run, lopez obrador branded the pri as corrupt and predictable. meade offered little detail of how he planned to root out corruption beyond pledging to strengthen institutions, echoing the rhetoric of pena nieto, whose approval ratings plumbed multi year lows, partly due to failure to tackle the issue. instead meade, 48, accused lopez obrador of seeking to avoid debate, and argued that his rival failed to root out corruption when he had the chance, as mayor of the capital.  whoever thinks that the answers to mexico s problems are about one person ... (or) are about being messianic ... is simplifying the complexity of building institutions that give us a nation of laws,  he said in another radio interview. meade, who has held most of the top cabinet jobs across two rival administrations, was at pains to stress his honesty, and said he had no skeletons in his closet.  that s why i feel very proud to look my children in the eyes, with them knowing that their dad has worked for mexico with integrity and honor,  he said.

" north korea violated an armistice agreement with south korea this month when north korean soldiers shot and wounded a north korean soldier as he defected across their border and it must not do so again, south korea s defense minister said on monday. the defector, a north korean soldier identified only by his surname, oh, was critically wounded but has been recovering in hospital in south korea. the incident comes at a time of heightened tension between north korea and the international community over its nuclear weapons program, but the north has not publicly responded to the defection at the sensitive border. south korean minister of defence song young moo issued his warning to the north while on a visit to the border where he commended south korean soldiers at a joint security area (jsa), in the so called truce village of panmunjom, in the demilitarized zone, for rescuing the defector. a north korean border guard briefly crossed the border with the south in the chase for the defector on nov. 13   a video released by the u.n. command (unc) in seoul showed   a violation of the ceasefire accord between north and south at the end of the 1950 53 korean war.       shooting towards the south at a defecting person, that s a violation of the armistice agreement,  song said.  crossing the military demarcation line, a violation. carrying automatic rifles (in the jsa), another violation,  he added as he stood near where south korean soldiers had found oh, collapsed and bleeding from his wounds.  north korea should be informed this sort of thing should never occur again.  since the defection, north korea has reportedly replaced guards stationed there. soldiers have fortified a section of the area seen aimed at blocking any more defections by digging a trench and planting trees.         as song was speaking 10 meters away from the trees north korean soldiers planted, four north korean soldiers were spotted listening closely. south korean military officials pointed out two bullet holes in a metal wall on a south korean building, from north korean shots fired at oh as he ran. oh has undergone several operations in hospital to remove bullets. his lead surgeon, lee cook jong, told reuters his patient has suffers from nightmares about being returned to the north. in south korea, six soldiers, three south korean and three american, were given awards by the u.s. forces korea last week in recognition for their efforts in rescuing the defector. after inspecting the site on monday, song met troops stationed there for lunch and praised them for acting  promptly and appropriately . south korea has been broadcasting news of the soldier s defection towards north korea via loudspeakers, according to the south s yonhap news agency.  south korean military officials have declined to confirm that.

" negotiators from canada, mexico and the united states will kick off an ambitious first round of trade talks on wednesday as the countries try to fast track a deal to modernize the north american free trade agreement by early next year. the key issues facing negotiators include: rules of origin: nafta says in order for a good to be traded duty free within the three countries, it must contain a certain percentage of north american content, which differs for various products. the rule of origin is most contentious in the auto industry; cars must contain at least 62.5 percent american, canadian or mexican content. the united states wants to increase the content threshold for nafta goods in a bid to return manufacturing jobs to the united states, and the auto industry has conceded that the rules should be updated to account for auto components that did not exist when the original deal was signed. canada has said it is prepared to discuss some strengthening of rule of origin in the auto sector, but that any change must apply equally to all three countries. mexico is willing to look at strengthening rules, but warns that going to far will make the region less competitive. dispute resolution: the united states has sought to ditch the so called chapter 19 tool, under which binational panels hear complaints about illegal subsidies and dumping and then issue binding decisions. the united states has frequently lost such cases since nafta came into effect in 1994, and the mechanism has hindered it from pursing anti dumping and anti subsidy cases against canadian and mexican companies. washington also argues that chapter 19 infringes on the sovereignty of its domestic laws. canada has said chapter 19 can be updated, but said a dispute settlement mechanism is its “red line” and must be part of any updated nafta. mexico also says dispute settlement mechanisms are a vital part of the deal to give investors security. supply management: quotas are a feature of nafta in several agricultural commodities including dairy and sugar, but washington is seeking to eliminate non tariff barriers to u.s. agricultural exports. most notably, u.s. president donald trump has called canada’s restrictions on dairy imports a “disgrace.” although dairy was excluded from the original 1994 deal, the united states is seeking to eliminate non tariff barriers to its agricultural exports.  currency manipulation: the united states is seeking a provision to deter currency manipulation. while washington wants a mechanism to ensure the nafta countries avoid tinkering with exchange rates to gain a competitive advantage, neither canada nor mexico is on the u.s. treasury’s currency manipulation watch list. critics say the u.s. demand is an attempt to get currency manipulation into a global trade agreement to establish a precedent with other trading partners, including china. government procurement: the united states is pushing for national, state and local governments in canada and mexico to open up their tender processes to u.s. made products but at the same time is defending existing “buy american” procurement laws. the buy american provisions have blocked the use of canadian steel to build u.s. bridges, and canada is pushing for a freer market for government procurement. mexico says it expects government procurement, already included in nafta, to be part of the renegotiation. investor state dispute settlement: the united states has proposed minor tweaking of the nafta chapter 11 provisions, which are designed to ensure firms that invest abroad receive “fair and equitable” treatment by foreign governments. as with chapter 19, opponents of the provisions argue they infringe on sovereignty which benefits multinational corporations. canada wants to update the mechanism to allow governments to regulate in the interest of the environment or labor, as in the comprehensive economic and trade agreement that canada recently negotiated with the european union.

" u.s. republican senator marco rubio reluctantly backed president donald trump’s nominee for secretary of state, rex tillerson, in a move that all but secures senate confirmation of the former exxon mobil corp chief executive as the nation’s top diplomat later on monday.  rubio said he was troubled by tillerson’s recent responses before lawmakers regarding russia as well as other countries, but that he ultimately decided he would vote to approve the nominee in deference to trump, as well as to fill a critical top job. “despite my reservations, i will support mr. tillerson’s nomination in committee and in the full senate,” rubio said in a statement ahead of the senate foreign relations committee’s vote on tillerson.  a vote in the republican controlled senate was expected shortly after the committee vote. tillerson was expected to win confirmation, despite opposition from democrats.  rubio, a onetime rival to trump for the republican presidential nomination, said he would not be so deferential regarding trump’s other nominees for top state department posts.   at a confirmation hearing earlier this month, tillerson’s views appeared to be at odds with trump’s on key foreign policy issues such as nuclear proliferation, trade deals, climate change and relations with mexico. the nominee also had a tense exchange with rubio on whether he believed russian president vladimir putin was a war criminal, in reference to russia’s military actions in support of syria’s government. tillerson said he would not use that term.  tillerson, 64, also sidestepped questions on human rights, declining to condemn countries like saudi arabia and the philippines for rights abuses.    over the weekend, fellow republican senators john mccain and lindsey graham said they would back tillerson despite their concerns over his relationship with putin as ceo of one of the world’s largest corporations.     republican senator rob portman on monday also voiced his support and said he was reassured by tillerson’s commitment at the jan. 11 hearing to support nato, an organization that trump has voiced differing opinions about. earlier on monday, the most senior democrat on the senate foreign relations committee, ben cardin, said he would not support tillerson. “the power of the secretary of state to call out wrong, to name and shame, and to fight each day on behalf of the american people and freedom seeking people the world over is an enduring symbol,” cardin said in a prepared statement.

" the trump administration plans to admit up to 45,000 refugees to the united states in the fiscal year starting oct. 1, a former u.s. official said on tuesday, a ceiling that would keep admissions to their lowest level in over a decade. the white house settled on the figure after a contentious debate between officials who wanted a lower ceiling and those who wanted a higher one, said the former official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. on one side of the debate were officials who tended to look at the issue through a domestic political prism given president donald trump’s focus on curbing immigration during the 2016 u.s.  presidential campaign.  on the other were foreign policy experts who argued that taking refugees into the united states is vital to ensure other nations keep their borders open. the plan to set the cap at 45,000 was earlier reported by the wall street journal newspaper. the former official, who favored a higher number, said the decision will undermine the u.s. ability to persuade nations such as jordan, turkey and lebanon that have accepted huge flows of syrian refugees to keep admitting them as well as to convince donor nations to keep up financial contributions for refugees. “we have no standing to play that role when we cut our own humanitarian assistance and when we are halving our refugee admissions,” said the former official. in his two travel ban executive orders, trump directed the united states to accept a maximum of 50,000 refugees for permanent resettlement in the fiscal 2017 year ending sept. 30, less than half the 110,000 president barack obama authorized. in part because of court challenges to those orders, the united states ultimately accepted more than 50,000 refugees during the current fiscal year. according to state department data, the united states took in 51,392 refugees through august. if the united states accepts 45,000 in fiscal 2018, it would be the lowest level admitted since fiscal 2006, when it took in 41,223, according to state department data. a state department spokesman declined comment on the 45,000 figure, saying only that secretary of state rex tillerson and acting secretary of homeland security elaine duke would consult congress on wednesday. “each year, the president makes an annual determination, after appropriate consultation with congress, regarding the refugee admissions ceiling for the following fiscal year. secretary tillerson and dhs acting secretary duke will consult with congress tomorrow,” he said.",0

" u.s. president donald trump could find democratic support for a corporate tax reform package if a comprehensive tax code overhaul runs aground over republican infighting, a democratic lawmaker told reuters on friday. representative john yarmuth, top democrat on the house of representatives budget committee, predicted trump’s promise to deliver the biggest tax reform since ronald reagan would have to be scaled back if the republican controlled senate fails next week to adopt legislation dismantling obamacare, formally known as the affordable care act. the trump administration and republican congressional leaders are trying to agree in closed door talks on a comprehensive 2017 tax reform bill that would cut taxes for individuals and businesses and overhaul the u.s. tax code. their aim is to unveil legislation in september.  but a republican effort to dismantle the affordable care act, which would could ease the path to tax reform, faces difficulties in the senate, where a healthcare measure is opposed by enough lawmakers to block passage. yarmuth, a kentucky democrat, said there are also few signs that house and senate republicans can unify their fractured caucuses to pass a fiscal 2018 budget resolution, which they must do to enact tax reform without democratic votes. “tax reform is going to be really difficult,” yarmuth said. “if they limited it to corporate tax reform, i think there’s an opportunity to get it home and get it done on a bipartisan basis.” trump wants to cut business tax rates to 15 percent. yarmuth said “a fair amount of democrats” agree that the current 35 percent corporate tax rate is too high and should be more competitive with other countries. a bipartisan package could lower the corporate tax rate to 25 percent or 28 percent and include measures to help small businesses, yarmuth said.    republicans have thus far balked at the idea of a narrow corporate tax deal. on thursday, house ways and means committee chairman kevin brady said republicans would reject tax legislation that left the corporate rate at around 28 percent.   but tax rate targets have eluded republican efforts to hammer out a deal. some lawmakers say a defeat for the senate healthcare bill would make tax reform harder by leaving in place hundreds of billions of dollars in obamacare taxes meanwhile, the house budget committee hopes to send a budget proposal to the floor next week that would include a procedural path for tax reform to proceed with only republican votes, panel members said. they warned that any republican deal within the committee did not ensure speedy passage in the republican led house, where conservative republicans want a budget that includes steep cuts to domestic spending, which more moderate republicans oppose. yarmuth said republicans, at one point, considered using language in a 2018 budget proposal   known as reconciliation instructions   for both tax reform and healthcare, a move that could keep hopes for dismantling obamacare alive if the senate fails to pass a bill.

" u.s. president donald trump on wednesday denied a report from nbc news that he told his national security advisers in july he wanted to increase the country’s nuclear arsenal by nearly tenfold, saying he argued for its modernization. nbc news said the president called for the increase after he was shown a chart indicating the stockpile of u.s. nuclear weapons had slid from a high of 32,000 in the 1960s. trump said he wanted to have that same number now, nbc reported. speaking to reporters at the white house during a meeting with canadian prime minister justin trudeau, trump said the report was not true. “i never discussed increasing it. i want it in perfect shape. that was just fake news by nbc,” he said. “we don’t need an increase. but i want modernization and i want total rehabilitation. it’s got to be in tip top shape.” the president’s denial was buttressed by a statement from his defense chief. “recent reports that the president called for an increase in the u.s. nuclear arsenal are absolutely false.  this kind of erroneous reporting is irresponsible,” defense secretary jim mattis said. although u.s. presidents have modernized weapon stockpiles over the years, any meaningful addition to the nuclear arsenal would violate treaty agreements. the federation of american scientists says the united states currently has about 4,000 nuclear warheads earmarked for use in its military stockpile. after the meeting in july, secretary of state rex tillerson referred to trump as a “moron,” according to nbc. u.s. news reports have painted the relationship between trump and tillerson as tense. the nbc report comes during a time of high tension between the united states and north korea over pyongyang’s nuclear weapons and missile programs, and just ahead of an expected announcement from trump on whether to decertify the international deal on iran’s nuclear program. trump told reuters in february that he wanted to ensure that the u.s. nuclear arsenal was at the “top of the pack.” msnbc reported in 2016 that as a candidate, trump asked a foreign policy adviser three times in a one hour meeting why the united states could not deploy its nuclear weapons.

" president donald trump’s proposals to slash federal aid to the poor, the sick and people living in rural areas reflect conservatives’ demands for a smaller federal government but target many of the very people who voted for him last november. in his first detailed budget submission to congress on tuesday, trump requested major reductions to programs that help poor families afford groceries and poor and disabled people get healthcare.  job training for unemployed coal miners would be threatened and drug treatment programs would face cuts at a time when heroin and prescription pill addictions are tearing at rural america. subsidies for commercial air travel in rural areas would be cut by more than half. the white house said many of the proposed cuts were aimed at ineffective programs and that the savings were needed to help balance the budget in 10 years and finance increased spending for defense and other programs. some republicans in congress cheered trump’s budget. representative mark meadows, who heads the house of representatives’ hard right freedom caucus, called it “a great step forward” for conservatives, adding: “it’s all about economic growth.”  but many other republican lawmakers, seeing a budget they think will be tough to sell back home, greeted it warily. “these cuts that are being proposed are draconian. they’re not mere savings. they’re really deep, deep cuts,” said republican representative hal rogers, whose eastern kentucky  district relies heavily on federal aid. trump trounced democrat hillary clinton in the 2016 election in kentucky, 63 percent to 33 percent, winning every region except the urban louisville and lexington areas. rogers, a 36 year congressman, said the republican president remained popular in his district, but added: “we have not yet had a chance to see how (voters) will react to his budget proposals.” it is unclear if the republican controlled house and senate will be able to pass a budget blueprint for the fiscal year starting on oct. 1. democratic votes would also likely be needed to pass the fiscal 2018 spending bills needed to carry out budget priorities. but the proposed reductions could trigger a backlash for republicans, complicating efforts to keep control of the u.s. congress in the 2018 midterm elections. trump’s own base of political support also could be undermined. republican representative tom cole, who represents an oklahoma district that the almanac of american politics described as “countrified,” predicted “congress would look at some of those things differently” from the trump administration’s budget. cole oversees spending on health and social welfare programs as chairman of a house appropriations panel and has a medical research facility important to his district that relies on federal funding. “the national institutes of health is not likely to be cut. i think cdc (centers for disease control) is not likely to be cut. i think that is ill advised personally,” cole told reporters. atop rogers’ list of worries is trump’s proposed elimination of the $146 million appalachian regional commission that has helped bring projects such as job training to unemployed coal miners, a broadband technology center to kentucky and high tech medical equipment to impoverished regions. the food stamp program, which helps low income and disabled people buy groceries, would be reduced by $200 billion over 10 years. according to u.s. department of agriculture figures, bedrock republican states that trump won have long food stamp rolls: 3.8 million people in texas, 682,077 in vice president mike pence’s home state of indiana, 815,000 in alabama and 1.6 million in georgia, for example. trump got broad support in last november’s election in counties with high numbers of white voters who receive food stamps. he was victorious in 991 of the 1,093 counties studied by the u.s. census bureau where the percentage of white households receiving food stamps exceeds the national average. overall, according to a reuters analysis, states would see federal aid shrink under the proposals by 3 percent in the next fiscal year, with cuts falling more heavily on states that voted for clinton. states that voted for trump would see federal aid decline by 1.2 percent, while those that supported clinton would collectively see a drop of 4.8 percent. liberal california would be hit hardest, with a 9.8 percent drop. kentucky, a conservative state that signed on to the affordable care act’s medicaid expansion, would also be hit hard, with assistance dropping by 9.7 percent.  some republican lawmakers welcomed the budget cuts. “i think we’re way over in the number of people who have been able to qualify for food stamps,” said john carter, who represents a central texas district. trump’s proposed budget cuts would help pay for a 10 percent buildup in defense spending for next year, and help finance a wall on the southwest border that trump previously had promised would be paid for by mexico, something the mexican government has adamantly said it will not do. the medicaid healthcare plan for the poor is slated for about an $800 billion cut, reversing the expansion that former democratic president barack obama’s signature affordable care act, popularly known as obamacare, brought to republican states like west virginia, arkansas and kentucky with large populations of poor people. “most of the (budget) cuts will focus on programs for low  income folks and public investments,” said maya macguineas, president of the committee for a responsible federal budget, which pushes for long term fixes to washington’s debt problems. levi russell, spokesman for americans for prosperity, the conservative group backed by billionaire charles koch, applauded trump’s call to balance the budget within 10 years, cut taxes and roll back regulations   moves he said would stimulate job growth. “it sends all of the right signals for the first time in nearly a decade   a budget that actually is focused on the best interests of the american taxpayer rather than what’s popular in washington,” he said.

" thousands of indonesians, led by islamist groups, held a rally near the myanmar embassy in jakarta on wednesday to protest against the treatment of rohingya muslims and demand the snapping of ties between the two countries.    indonesia has the world s largest population of muslims and there have been several anti myanmar protests in jakarta and the malaysian capital of kuala lumpur over the treatment of buddhist majority myanmar s roughly 1.1 million rohingyas.  roads were blocked and barbed wire barriers put up around the embassy, in a leafy district of the capital, which was patrolled by police in riot gear who set up water cannons. some protesters chanted  allahu akbar  (god is greatest), while others shouted slogans such as  slaughter myanmar  and  burn the embassy . buddhists should respect muslims in myanmar in the same way that muslims respected buddhists in indonesia, one speaker told the crowd, using a loud hailer.    almost 125,000 rohingyas have been forced to flee clashes between rohingya insurgents and the army in myanmar s northwestern state of rakhine. tens of thousands have crossed the border into neighboring bangladesh. indonesian foreign minister retno marsudi met myanmar leader aung san suu kyi and top security officials this week to urge a halt to the bloodshed. marsudi also visited dhaka, capital of bangladesh on tuesday, to offer help in tackling the crisis. some protesters at the jakarta rally called for the expulsion of the myanmar ambassador over the issue, as well as for diplomatic ties between the two countries to be severed. myanmar embassy staff would be safe, however, said a foreign ministry spokesman, armanatha nasir.   it is the responsibility of the host countries to ensure the safety of all diplomatic missions and their personnel,  the spokesman said.  indonesia takes this responsibility seriously.   at the weekend, a petrol bomb was thrown at the embassy causing a small fire. indonesian police have also pledged to bar islamist groups from staging a rally on friday at the borobudur buddhist temple in central java to protest against the treatment of myanmar s rohingya muslims.

" u.s. president donald trump on thursday ordered the unveiling of 2,800 documents related to the 1963 assassination of president john f. kennedy but yielded to pressure from the fbi and cia to block the release of other records to be reviewed further.  congress had ordered in 1992 that all remaining sealed files pertaining to the investigation into kennedy’s death should be fully opened to the public through the national archives in 25 years, by oct. 26, 2017, except for those the president authorized for further withholding. trump had confirmed on saturday that he would allow for the release of the final batch of once classified records, amounting to tens of thousands of pages, “subject to the receipt of further information.” but as the deadline neared, the administration decided at the last minute to stagger the final release over the next 180 days while government agencies studied whether any documents should stay sealed or redacted. the law allows the president to keep material under wraps if it is determined that harm to intelligence operations, national defense, law enforcement or the conduct of foreign relations would outweigh the public’s interest in full disclosure. more than 2,800 uncensored documents were posted immediately to the national archives website on thursday evening   a staggering, disparate cache that news outlets began poring through seeking new insights into a tragedy that has been endlessly dissected for decades by investigators, scholars and conspiracy theorists. the rest will be released “on a rolling basis,” with “redactions in only the rarest of circumstances,” by the end of the review on april 26, 2018, the white house said in a statement. in a memo to government agency heads, trump said the american people deserved as much access as possible to the records. “therefore, i am ordering today that the veil finally be lifted,” he wrote, adding that he had no choice but to accept the requested redactions for now.  a central intelligence agency spokesman told reuters that every single one of approximately 18,000 remaining cia records in the collection would ultimately be released, with just 1 percent of the material left redacted. cia director mike pompeo was a lead advocate in arguing to the white house for keeping some materials secret, one senior administration official said. while kennedy was killed over half a century ago, the document file included material from investigations during the 1970s through the 1990s. intelligence and law enforcement officials argued their release could thus put at risk some more recent “law enforcement equities” and other materials that still have relevance, the official said. trump was resistant but “acceded to it with deep insistence that this stuff is going to be reviewed and released in the next six months,” the official added. academics who have studied kennedy’s slaying on nov. 22, 1963, said they expected nothing in the final batch of files would alter the official conclusion of investigators that lee harvey oswald was the lone assassin who fired on the president’s open limousine that day in dallas from an upper window of the texas book depository building overlooking the motorcade route. they likewise anticipated that the latest releases would do little to quell long held conspiracy theories that the 46 year old democratic president’s killing was organized by the mafia, by cuba, or a cabal of rogue agents. of the roughly 5 million pages of jfk assassination related records held by the national archives, 88 percent have been available to the public without restriction since the late 1990s, and 11 percent more have been released with sensitive portions redacted. only about 1 percent have remain withheld in full, according to the national archives. thousands of books, articles, tv shows and films have explored the idea that kennedy’s assassination was the result of an elaborate conspiracy. none have produced conclusive proof that oswald, who was fatally shot by a nightclub owner two days after killing kennedy, worked with anyone else, although they retain a powerful cultural currency. “my students are really skeptical that oswald was the lone assassin,” said patrick maney, a professor of history at boston college. “it’s hard to get our minds around this, that someone like a loner, a loser, could on his own have murdered kennedy and changed the course of world history. but that’s where the evidence is.” kennedy’s assassination was the first in a string of politically motivated killings, including those of his brother robert f. kennedy and civil rights leader martin luther king jr., that stunned the united states during the turbulent 1960s. he remains one of the most admired u.s. presidents.

" the u.s. house on wednesday unanimously approved a sweeping proposal to speed the deployment of self driving cars without human controls by putting federal regulators in the driver’s seat and barring states from blocking autonomous vehicles. the house measure, the first significant federal legislation aimed at speeding self driving cars to market, would allow automakers to obtain exemptions to deploy up to 25,000 vehicles without meeting existing auto safety standards in the first year. the cap would rise over three years to 100,000 vehicles annually. representative doris matsui said the bill “puts us on a path towards innovation which, up until recently, seemed unimaginable.” automakers, business groups, and advocates for the blind praised the house measure. but one consumer group said the house bill did not do enough to ensure self driving cars would be safe. under the bill, manufacturers seeking exemptions must demonstrate self driving cars are at least as safe as existing vehicles. states could still set rules on registration, licensing, liability, insurance and safety inspections, but not performance standards. automakers would have to submit safety assessment reports to regulators, but the bill would not require pre market approval of advanced vehicle technologies. the measure now goes to the senate, where a bipartisan group of lawmakers has been working on similar legislation.  automakers and technology companies, including general motors co and alphabet inc’s  self driving unit waymo, hope to begin deploying vehicles around 2020. they have been pushing for new federal rules making it easier to deploy self driving technology, but some consumer groups have sought additional safeguards.  current federal rules bar self driving cars without human controls on u.s. roads. states have issued a variety of different rules in the absence of clear federal guidance, and automakers have complained that california’s rules are too restrictive. u.s. senators might circulate their draft legislation this week. one sticking point is how to handle commercial self driving trucks, which are not included in the house measure. the senate version may also soften the provisions preempting state rules.  volkswagen ag (vowg_p.de) and other automakers have been lobbying congress to act, often bringing test vehicles to capitol hill so lawmakers can test out driverless cars. advocates hope self driving cars can help reduce u.s. road deaths, which rose 7.7 percent in 2015, the highest annual jump since 1966. the u.s. national highway traffic safety administration said in a 2014 study that u.s. traffic crashes cost society $836 billion a year in economic loss, with human error behind 94 percent of crashes. consumer advocates want to give the national highway traffic safety administration quicker access to crash data and more funding to oversee self driving cars. “the autonomous vehicle bill just passed by the house leaves a wild west without adequate safety protections for consumers. it pre empts any state safety standards, but there are none at the national level,” the consumer watchdog group said in a statement. the policy group transportation for america said cities are worried the house “legislation will preempt local authorities from managing their own streets and fail to give local leaders the confidence that manufacturers and operators will be aware of and follow local laws and regulations.” on tuesday, reuters reported that u.s. transportation secretary elaine chao will unveil revised self driving guidelines next tuesday in ann arbor, michigan, citing sources, and the department confirmed plans to unveil the new guidelines next week. the house bill would require compliance with the guidelines. gm said in a statement that “while more work is needed,” the house measure is “good progress toward a law that will facilitate realization of the safety, mobility, and environmental benefits of self driving vehicles.” the house bill would also require automakers to add a driver alert to check rear seating in an effort to prevent children from being left behind, and to consider performance standards for headlights.

" canada laid down a tough line ahead of talks on modernizing nafta on monday, suggesting it could walk away if the united states pushed to remove a key dispute settlement mechanism in the trade deal. foreign minister chrystia freeland, giving the most substantive outline yet of canada’s goals, said she was “very optimistic” the negotiations would be a success.  north american free trade agreement members canada, mexico and the united states hold their first session in washington on wednesday. canada, heavily reliant on exports to the united states, opposes washington’s push to scrap the so called chapter 19 dispute settlement mechanism, under which binational panels make binding decisions on complaints about illegal subsidies and dumping. the united states has frequently lost such cases. “canada will uphold and preserve the elements in nafta that canadians deem key to our national interest – including a process to ensure anti dumping and countervailing duties are only applied fairly when truly warranted,” freeland said in a speech at the university of ottawa. noting that canada had withdrawn its chief negotiator from 1987 talks on a bilateral trade treaty with the united states over the same issue, freeland said “our government will be equally resolute.” freeland later sidestepped reporters’ questions about whether maintaining chapter 19 was a make or break issue for canada, saying she would let her u.s. counterparts know how important the matter was to ottawa. trade among the three nations has quadrupled since nafta came into effect in 1994, surpassing $1 trillion in 2015. but u.s. president donald trump regularly calls the treaty a disaster and has threatened to walk away from it unless major changes are made, citing u.s. job losses and a trade deficit with mexico. toronto trade lawyer mark warner said there few surprises in freeland’s announcement, given ottawa had already signaled its stance on major issues. “it’s the beginning of a negotiation. everybody expects posturing,” he said by phone, noting washington had reacted calmly to previous canadian statements about the importance of dispute settlement. freeland, who predicted there would be moments of drama during the talks, said canada wanted a progressive trade deal featuring stricter environmental and labor standards as well as a focus on climate change, a concept trump has little time for. canada, like mexico, sends the majority of its exports to the united states and would be hurt by u.s. protectionist moves. the united states runs a slight surplus in trade of goods and services with canada, which has mounted a major outreach campaign to persuade u.s. business leaders and politicians that nafta is a success. “american partners have been listening,” freeland said. “they understand ... our relationship, the greatest economic partnership in the world, is balanced and mutually beneficial.” freeland stressed that canada would protect tariffs and quotas that keep domestic dairy prices high and imports low. u.s. dairy farmers strongly dislike the system. a modernized nafta should take into account technological advances and make it easier for professionals to move from one member nation to another, she added.

" eberhard van der laan, amsterdam s popular mayor, has died of lung cancer, the city said on friday.  van der laan informed city residents of his illness in january, saying the prognosis left  little reason for optimism . when he retreated from public life three weeks ago, thousands gathered in front of his canal side house to applaud for several minutes in a display of support. van der laan, 62, was known as an effective, pragmatic and sometimes combative mayor with a sense of humor.  when an  occupy  tent camp arose in front of the stock market in october 2011, van der laan was a frequent visitor, engaging protesters in discussion. he allowed the tents to remain until a court ordered them cleared months later. one of his most remarkable moments on an international stage was in 2013 when van der laan said he was too busy to meet vladimir putin during the russian president s visit to amsterdam, and ordered a rainbow flag flown from city hall in protest at russian policies against homosexuals.  the former lawyer served briefly as housing minister and shortly after becoming mayor in 2010 enforced a law banning squatting, sparking minor riots and banishing a long amsterdam tradition to the fringes. van der laan is survived by his wife and five children from two marriages.

" mexico s president on monday threw himself into areas badly hit by last week s devastating earthquake amid frustration at delays in getting food and water to stricken communities where at least 96 people died and 2.5 million were left in need of aid. accompanied by several cabinet ministers, president enrique pena nieto took on a busy schedule as he toured the battered southern state of chiapas, seeking to inspire confidence in the government s relief effort. pena nieto s approval ratings have plumbed depths lower than any recent president, and his institutional revolutionary party (pri) faces a major struggle to retain power in presidential elections next july. the law bars him from seeking re election. speaking in the hard hit city of tonala, pena nieto urged construction companies to aid rebuilding efforts.  if construction firms commit to showing solidarity by building a few homes ... construction efforts can be carried out quicker,  he said.  don t let anyone take advantage of you, or take control of your affairs. the government is here.  mexican cement producer cemex said on monday it would donate $1 million worth of aid to reconstruction efforts. the final cost of the quake is likely to be far higher. among those with pena nieto were interior minister miguel angel osorio chong and finance minister jose antonio meade, both potential pri candidates for the presidency. the quake killed at least sixteen people in chiapas and four others in tabasco. the vast majority of deaths so far reported were the 76 in neighboring oaxaca state. many oaxaca fatalities were in the town of juchitan, where more than 5,000 homes were destroyed. tens of thousands of others were damaged in the region. government officials delivered bags of simple rations including water and canned food on sunday, but many juchitan residents complained about the slow pace of assistance.  we don t have food or water, we re desperate,  said jesus ramirez, 27, who works in a plastics factory.  we re trying to eat whatever we can find, any kind of food.  much of juchitan and its surroundings had no running water, and piles of rubble were still restricting access to streets. electricity was returning, but residents complained officials were slow to conduct house by house damage assessments. alfredo jimenez, a 19 year old engineering student, said he and neighbors banded together to help victims of seven flattened homes in the area, feeling unable to count on the government.   we see government people passing by, the army and the marines, but they haven t offered us anything,  he said. margarita lopez, 56, a domestic worker, lined up for assistance in one juchitan neighborhood where nearly every house was severely damaged.  almost nothing has arrived from the government, and we don t know what else we can do,  lopez said. thursday s 8.1 magnitude quake was the most powerful to hit mexico in 85 years, surpassing a 1985 temblor that killed thousands in mexico city and triggered public outcry over the government response. that disaster hurt the pri s reputation and some analysts believe it contributed to its removal from power in a 2000 vote, ending 71 consecutive years of one party rule. under pressure to do more at home, the government on monday withdrew an offer to help victims of hurricane harvey in texas. mexico has been coping with heavy rains and the impact from hurricane katia on the gulf state of veracruz. the quake struck off the coast of chiapas, and mexico s national seismological institute said more than 1,000 aftershocks have since been reported. state run oil company pemex said on monday it has not restarted its salina cruz refinery due to the aftershocks.

" numerous voting machines in heavily democratic detroit showed a greater number of ballots than poll workers records said were  cast in the nov. 8 presidential election, the detroit news reported on tuesday. about 37 percent of precincts in wayne county, michigan, where detroit is located, showed such discrepancies, the newspaper reported, citing records prepared at its request by the county. voting irregularities in detroit have prompted the state to audit the election results in the city, the newspaper said. michigan was one of three rust belt states in which the campaign of green party presidential candidate jill stein  requested a recount of the presidential election. those efforts came to an end in michigan on friday when the michigan supreme court refused to review an appeal of a lower court order barring a recount. on monday, all three efforts were suspended after weeks of legal wrangling yielded a recount in wisconsin only, and it favored republican winner donald trump. a federal judge in pennsylvania rejected stein’s request for a recount and an examination of that state’s voting machines for evidence of hacking in the election. meanwhile, wisconsin election officials said on monday they had completed a 10 day recount that found trump’s margin of victory over democrat hillary clinton had increased by 131 votes.

" iraqi forces launched on thursday an offensive to recapture the last patch of iraqi territory still in the hands of islamic state, on the border area with syria, prime minister haider al abadi said.  daesh members have to choose between death and surrender,  he said in a statement announcing the offensive on region of al qaim and rawa. the iraqi airforce dropped thousands of leaflets on the border area calling on the militants to surrender and urging the population to stay away from their positions, according to a statement from the joint operations command in baghdad. the militant group also holds parts of the syrian side of the border, but the area under their control is shrinking as they retreat in the face of two sets of hostile forces   a u.s. backed, kurdish led coalition and syrian government troops with foreign shi ite militias backed by iran and russia. islamic state s self declared cross border caliphate effectively collapsed in july, when u.s. backed iraqi forces captured mosul, the group s de facto capital in iraq, in a grueling battle which lasted nine months. the militants  syrian stronghold, raqqa, fell to u.s. backed forces last week. islamic state leader abu bakr al baghdadi, who declared the caliphate from mosul in mid 2014, released an audio recording on sept. 28 that indicated he was alive, after several reports he had been killed. he urged his followers to keep up the fight despite setbacks.  tell those among your children and relatives who took up a weapon against the state to throw it aside immediately, and to go to any house on top of which a white flag have been raised when the liberation forces enter al qaim,  said the leaflets dropped by the iraqi airforce. regular army units, sunni tribal forces and iranian backed popular mobilisation are taking part in the offensive toward the syrian border, the joint operations command said.

" nazareth, the israeli arab city where jesus is thought to have been raised, has canceled some christmas celebrations in protest at u.s. president donald trump s recognition of jerusalem as israel s capital, an official said. trump announced the move last week, reversing decades of u.s. policy and recognized jerusalem as the capital of israel, jeopardizing middle east peace efforts and upsetting the arab world and western allies alike. nazareth, the largest arab town in israel with a muslim and christian population of 76,000, is one of the holy land s focal points of christmas festivities.  we have decided to cancel the traditional christmas singing and dancing because we are in a time of dispute, because of what trump has said about jerusalem,  city spokesman salem sharara said. nazareth is traditionally thought to be where jesus grew up. the imposing basilica of the annunciation in central nazareth is built on a site which many christian faithful believe was the childhood home of jesus  mother, mary.  sharara said the town s market stalls and the traditional christmas church services would be held as they are every year. within an hour of the announcement, the palestinian towns of bethlehem, jesus s traditional birthplace, and ramallah in the israeli occupied west bank briefly switched off their christmas lights in protest.  there was no word from the bethlehem municipality whether it was also weighing a cutback on its celebrations at a crucial time of year for the town s tourist trade.

" u.s. president barack obama and australian prime minister malcolm turnbull pledged on tuesday to increase cooperation on counterterrorism and the fight against islamic state. obama praised australia for its support in afghanistan and thanked the prime minister for his country’s troops’ sacrifices around the world. “we’re going to talk about how we can strengthen our cooperation both in syria and iraq, the state of affairs in afghanistan, but also countering violent extremism globally,” obama told reporters in the oval office at the start of the meeting. “australia will be a very important partner in that process,” he said. turnbull said it was critical to improve efforts to fight islamic state. “we have to constantly lift our game in the way we engage with and tackle these extremists, particularly isil   but there are many others   as they operate in the cyber sphere,” he said, referring to islamic state with an acronym. “archaic and barbaric though they may be, their use regrettably of the internet is very sophisticated. and so i’m pleased that we’re going to be working on even closer collaboration there.” the two leaders also discussed their backing of the trans pacific partnership trade pact. “it is going to be good for our economy. it is going to be good for our workers and our businesses, and it reaffirms that in order for us to thrive in the 21st century ... it’s important for us to be making the rules in this region, and that’s exactly what tpp does,” obama said. turnbull congratulated obama on the implementation of the iran nuclear deal.

" criminal justice reform advocates said they expect donald trump will embrace moderate change once he is in the white house, toning down the punitive but undefined “law and order” image he projected on the campaign trail. in another instance of experts trying to pin down trump on an issue he used on the stump without offering much detail, two groups that have met recently with his staff said they expect him to back mainstream sentencing and corrections reforms. a trump spokeswoman did not respond to requests for comment. in a meeting a few weeks ago, trump’s staff was “very receptive” to arguments that crime rates have dropped in states that have reduced prison populations through sentencing reform, said holly harris, executive director of the u.s. justice action network, a bipartisan coalition that spearheads legislative efforts to lower sentences for nonviolent offenders. democratic president barack obama, many republicans in congress and several of trump’s conservative mentors have embraced changing sentencing standards and better prisons. during the campaign, trump denounced obama as being too soft on inner city violence and for extremist plots against the united states and attacks on police officers. for instance, in the oct. 19 presidential debate with democratic opponent hillary clinton, trump said: “we need law and order, but we need justice, too. our inner cities are a disaster. you get shot walking to the store. they have no education. they have no jobs.” but in the same month, trump’s vice presidential running mate, mike pence, said he was proud that indiana approved criminal justice reform during his tenure as governor.  “we have got to do a better job recognizing and correcting the errors in the system that do reflect an institutional bias in criminal justice,” he said. tim head, executive director of the conservative christian faith and freedom coalition, said his group has held advisory talks with the president elect’s staff in recent days. head said trump’s justice department is likely to emphasize greater “support for law enforcement, maybe deference for law enforcement” than obama did. but head and harris also both noted that republicans close to trump, such as former house speaker newt gingrich and new jersey governor chris christie have advocated for reforms such as lowering sentences for some nonviolent crimes, improving prison conditions and helping former prisoners find jobs and housing. christie and former new york city mayor rudy giuliani are reportedly on a short list of conservatives whom trump is considering for u.s. attorney general. inimai chettiar, director of justice programs at the brennan center for justice of new york university, said trump made some  “troubling” campaign trail claims. one, she said, was arguing that rising crime justifies stop and frisk tactics and other police methods that critics say unfairly target minorities. however, she said, she also hoped the president elect would fall in line with members of the republican party who support bipartisan criminal justice reform.

" illinois governor bruce rauner said on monday he was holding off  issuance of up to $6 billion of bonds to help pay down the state’s more than $14 billion in overdue bills despite the state comptroller’s public plea for the debt sale.  the republican governor called on illinois comptroller susana mendoza to tap more than $600 million in various state accounts first to pay bills. authorization for the general obligation bonds and for using money parked in the accounts was included in the fiscal 2018 budget the democratic controlled legislature enacted in july over the governor’s vetoes. [nl1n1jx20r] rauner also said the state cannot go to market with the debt until he works with state lawmakers to identify an appropriation or plan to pay off the new bonds.  “this bonding in and of itself is not the answer,” rauner told reporters. in a video and statement on monday, mendoza said illinois’ bill backlog is costing residents $2 million a day in late payment penalties that can reach as much as 12 percent a year. the bond authorization, which expires on dec. 31, was aimed at having rauner’s budget office sell the 12 year bonds at a lower interest rate.  the debt is covered under the illinois go bond act, which constitutes an irrevocable and continuing appropriation for principal and interest payments on all of the state’s outstanding bonds, according to budget legislation. illinois’ unprecedented two year budget impasse ballooned the unpaid bill total to a record $15.4 billion in june. as of friday, the backlog stood at $14.35 billion.  abdon pallasch, a spokesman for the democratic comptroller, said inter fund transfers were already underway. “what we need right now is movement by the governor’s office and a solid timetable for refinancing the debt so that our office can establish a comprehensive cash management plan for the remainder of fiscal year 2018,” he said. on monday, illinois bonds due in 12 years were yielding  4.13 percent, according to municipal market data, a unit of thomson reuters. illinois has the lowest credit ratings and pays the highest borrowing costs among the 50 u.s. states. since enacting its first budget in two years along with a $5 billion income tax hike, and subsequently evading junk bond ratings, the state’s so called credit spread over mmd’s benchmark triple a yield scale has narrowed. mendoza’s office said the new borrowing will provide some relief to service providers and businesses that have been waiting months for payment.  “over the past two years without a budget, they have had to exhaust their lines of credit, lay off employees and, in some cases, turn away illinois citizens in need of services,” a  statement from the comptroller said.

" iraq demanded on thursday that the u.s. government backtrack on a decision to recognize jerusalem as israel s capital and summoned the u.s. ambassador in baghdad to protest the decision. u.s. president donald trump reversed decades of u.s. policy on wednesday and recognized jerusalem as the capital of israel, imperiling middle east peace efforts and upsetting the arab world and western allies alike. shi ite majority iraq is the only country to have an alliance with regional powerhouse iran and the united states, who do not see eye to eye. the iraqi foreign ministry said it had summoned the u.s. ambassador in baghdad and that it would hand him a memo protesting trump s decision.  we caution against the dangerous repercussions of this  decision on the stability of the region and the world,  an iraqi government statement said.   the u.s. administration has to backtrack on this decision to stop any dangerous escalation that would fuel extremism and create conditions favorable to terrorism,  it said. iraq s top shi ite cleric grand ayatollah ali al sistani condemned the decision and called on the  umma , or islamic nation, to unite its efforts and reclaim jerusalem.  this decision is condemned and decried, it hurt the feelings of hundreds of millions of arabs and muslims,  his office said in a statement.  but it won t change the reality that jerusalem is an occupied land which should return to the sovereignty of its palestinian owners no matter how long it takes,  it said. dozens of iraqis protested the decision in baghdad, carrying signs saying  jerusalem is arab  and vowing to return in greater numbers the following day after friday prayers. a prominent iraqi militia, the iran backed harakat hezbollah al nujaba, said trump s decision could become a  legitimate reason  to attack u.s. forces in iraq.  trump s stupid decision to make jerusalem a capital for the zionist will be the big spark for removing this entity from the body of the islamic nation, and a legitimate reason to target american forces,  said the group s leader akram al kaabi. the united states is leading an international coalition helping iraq fight islamic state and has provided air and ground support. it has more than 5,000 troops in iraq. nujaba, which has about 10,000 fighters, is one of the most important militias in iraq. though made up of iraqis, it is loyal to iran and is helping tehran create a supply route through iraq to damascus. it fights under the umbrella of the popular mobilisation forces (pmf), a mostly iranian backed coalition of shi ite militias that played a role in combating islamic state. the pmf is government sanctioned and formally reports to prime minister haider al abadi s office.

" the united states is encouraged by china’s efforts to restrain north korea but washington will not accept beijing’s militarization of islands in the south china sea, u.s. defense secretary jim mattis said on saturday. the comments by mattis, during the annual shangri la dialogue, show how u.s. president donald trump’s administration is looking to balance working with china to restrain north korea’s advancing missile and nuclear programs while dealing with beijing’s activities in the south china sea. u.s. allies have been worried by trump’s actively courting chinese president xi jinping to restrain north korea, fearing washington might allow china a more free rein elsewhere in the region. some allies have also expressed concern that washington’s withdrawal from the trans pacific trade partnership and the paris global climate accord signals the united states is diluting its global leadership role. speaking at the dialogue, asia’s premier security forum, mattis said the united states remained fully engaged with its partners.  “like it or not, we are a part of the world...what a crummy world if we all retreat inside our borders,” he said.  “once we have exhausted all possible alternatives, the americans will do the right thing,” mattis added, paraphrasing a quotation by british wartime leader winston churchill. “so we will still be there and we will be there with you.” nevertheless, reversing or slowing north korea’s nuclear and missile programs has become a security priority for washington, given pyongyang’s vow to develop a nuclear tipped missile capable of hitting the u.s. mainland. the trump administration has been pressing china aggressively to rein in its reclusive neighbor, warning all options are on the table if north korea persists with its weapons programs. “the trump administration is encouraged by china’s renewed commitment to work with the international community toward denuclearization,” mattis said.  “ultimately, we believe china will come to recognize north korea as a strategic liability, not an asset.” however, mattis said seeking china’s cooperation on north korea did not mean washington would not challenge beijing’s activities in the south china sea. the u.n. security council on friday expanded targeted sanctions against north korea after its repeated missile tests, adopting the first such resolution agreed by the united states and china since trump took office. in another sign of increased pressure on north korea, japan’s navy and air force began a three day military exercise with two u.s. aircraft carriers in the sea of japan on thursday. japanese defense minister tomomi inada, speaking at the singapore forum, said tokyo backed the united states using any option to deal with north korea, including military strikes, and was seeking a deeper alliance with washington. but she also said she was concerned about the situation in the south china sea and in the east china sea.    china’s claims in the south china sea, through which about $5 trillion in ship borne trade passes each year, are contested by brunei, malaysia, the philippines, taiwan and vietnam. china and japan both claim islands in the east china sea. low key china, which sent only a low key delegation to the forum,  said its ties with the united states were vital for the region. “i believe that if china and the united states can ensure no conflict, as well as maintain mutual respect, cooperation and trust, it will contribute greatly to security in the asia pacific and the world,” lt gen he lei, the head of beijing’s delegation, told reporters.     allies around the world have been concerned about the commitment of the united states since trump took office on jan. 20 because of his “america first” rhetoric and expectations that he would concentrate on a domestic agenda. “we are still trying to figure out his (trump’s) policy in our region,” said malaysian defense minister hishammuddin hussein. “i would like to know very clearly what are the true intentions of the new administration.”    mattis sought to ease concerns for allies in the asia pacific, saying the region was a priority and the primary effort was alliance building. he added, however, that countries must “contribute sufficiently to their own security.” in a sign of the u.s. commitment to the region, mattis said that soon about 60 percent of overseas tactical aviation assets would be assigned to the region and he would work with the u.s. congress on an asia pacific stability initiative. mattis said the united states welcomed china’s economic development, but he anticipated “friction” between the two countries. “while competition between the u.s. and china, the world’s two largest economies, is bound to occur, conflict is not inevitable,” mattis said.  while eager to work with china in dealing with north korea, mattis said the united states did not accept china placing weapons and other military assets on man made islands in the south china sea.  “we oppose countries militarizing artificial islands and enforcing excessive maritime claims,” mattis said. “we cannot and will not accept unilateral, coercive changes to the status quo.” ",0
" the alarming volume of hate speech during australia s ballot over whether to legalize same sex marriage spurred parliament  to pass emergency legislation on wednesday to outlaw opponents spewing their vitriol while the vote was in progress. australia began a non compulsory postal vote on tuesday that will determine whether it becomes the 25th country to legalize same sex marriage. but with an emotionally charged campaign raising concerns about the welfare of vulnerable australians, the government moved to strengthen laws preventing hate speech. the opposition labor party supported the amendment, though it had rejected the need for a ballot on the issue. until voting ends on november 7, anyone found guilty of intimidation, or threats to cause harm on the basis of the sexual orientation, gender identity, intersex status   people who are born with genetic, hormonal or physical sex characteristics that are not typically male or female   or the religious convictions of someone will be liable to fines of a$12,500 (over $10,000) and a court injunction.  this bill cannot stop all of the hurt, all of the prejudice that is being expressed, all of the lack of acceptance that is being communicated to lgbti australians, to same sex couple families. but it provides limited protections,  said penny wong, leader of the opposition in the senate.

" the trump administration put new requirements in place on friday for the 38 countries participating in the u.s. visa waiver program, including that they use u.s. counterterrorism data to screen travelers, officials said. the program allows citizens of mainly european countries to travel to the united states for up to 90 days without a visa. citizens from the 38 countries are required to obtain a so called travel authorization to enter the united states. president donald trump has sought to tighten the rules for those seeking to visit or live in the united states in several ways, saying restrictions are necessary for security reasons. the changes will apply to all countries in the program. one change is that they will be required to use u.s. information to screen travelers crossing their borders from third countries. many countries in the program already do that, one administration official said. countries whose citizens stay longer than authorized during visits to the united states at a relatively higher rate will be required to conduct public awareness campaigns on the consequences of overstays, the officials said. one existing penalty is that people who overstay a visit may not travel visa free to the united states in the future. the threshold for the overstay rate triggering the public information campaign requirement is two percent, the officials said. in the 2016 fiscal year, of the vwp countries, greece, hungary, portugal, and san marino, a wealthy enclave landlocked inside central italy, had total overstay rates higher than two percent, according to a report by the department of homeland security. the overall overstay rate for vwp countries is 0.68 percent, lower than non vwp countries excluding canada and mexico, which is at 2.07 percent, according to the dhs report. members of congress have expressed concern about the security risks of overstays. a may 2017 report by the dhs inspector general found the department lacked a comprehensive system to gather information on departing visitors, forcing it to rely on third party data to confirm departures, which is sometimes faulty. the united states will also start assessing vwp countries on their safeguards against “insider threats” at their airports, especially those with direct flights to the united states, officials said. the goal is to ensure countries “make sure that airport employees, aviation workers et cetera, aren’t corrupted or are co opted to pose a threat to aircraft, especially those that are u.s. bound,” an official said.

" the obama administration reversed course on tuesday on a proposal to open the southeastern atlantic coast to drilling as an oil price slump and strong opposition in coastal communities raised doubts about the plan. besides market and environmental concerns, the u.s. interior department said it also based its decision on conflicts with competing commercial and military ocean uses. the decision, which is sure to reverberate in the presidential election campaign, reverses a january 2015 proposal for new leases in the atlantic as part of the department’s five year plan to set new boundaries for oil development in federal waters through 2022. “we heard from many corners that now is not the time to offer oil and gas leasing off the atlantic coast,” interior secretary sally jewell said.  “when you factor in conflicts with national defense, economic activities such as fishing and tourism, and opposition from many local communities, it simply doesn’t make sense to move forward with any lease sales in the coming five years.” hillary clinton, the front runner in the race for the democratic party’s nomination to run in the nov. 8 presidential election, has moved to the left on environment under pressure from green groups. she tweeted: “relieved atlantic drilling is now off the table. time to do the next right thing and protect the arctic, too.” donald trump, the businessman and former reality tv personality who is the republican front runner, has raised questions about whether more offshore drilling is necessary given the abundance of onshore shale production. the proposal would have opened up drilling sites more than 50 miles off virginia, north and south carolina, and georgia to oil drilling by 2021.  coastal communities in these states protested the administration’s plan, fearing the possibility of an oil spill like the bp horizon accident in 2010 on the u.s. gulf coast, and its effects on tourism and their economies. “with this decision coastal communities have won a ‘david vs. goliath’ fight against the richest companies on the planet, and that is a cause for tremendous optimism for the well being of future generations,” said jacqueline savitz, environmental group oceana’s vice president for u.s. oceans. virginia officials had welcomed the initial plan to allow offshore drilling, saying it would bring economic benefits. on tuesday, senator tim kaine, a democrat from virginia, said he was surprised that the department of defense had raised concerns about naval installations, one of which is off the state’s coast. “the dod has been relatively quiet during this public debate and has never shared their objections with me before,” he said. major oil companies, including exxon mobil corp, shell and chevron, had pushed for an open atlantic. shell oil company spokeswoman natalie mazey said the decision was “short sighted” and would “jeopardize the abundance of affordable domestic energy the economy has become dependent on.”     the american petroleum institute said the decision goes against the will of voters, governors and members of congress who support more development. “the decision appeases extremists who seek to stop oil and natural gas production which would increase the cost of energy for american consumers and close the door for years to creating new jobs, new investments and boosting energy security,” said api president jack gerard. the interior department also announced tuesday that it would evaluate 13 other potential lease sales in other areas of the country   10 in the gulf of mexico and three off the coast of alaska. “the proposal focuses potential lease sales in areas with the highest resource potential, greatest industry interest, and established infrastructure,” jewell said. the interior department said that in the gulf, resource potential and industry interest are high and infrastructure already exists.  it proposes two annual lease sales that include the western, central, and part of the eastern gulf of mexico not subject to the current congressional moratorium.  it also includes a potential sale each in the chukchi sea, beaufort sea, and cook inlet planning areas in alaska. the department would take comments on other options, including an alternative that includes no new leasing. while green groups praised the decision to keep the atlantic off limits for now, they raised concerns that the united states would keep the door open for drilling in the vulnerable u.s. arctic. “the administration must take arctic leases out of the final five year plan,” said cindy shogan, executive director of the alaska wilderness league. “no place has potentially more to lose due to climate change than the arctic.” the interior department will open the five year proposal to a 90 day comment period.

" an islamist attack on a hotel in mogadishu ended on sunday after 29 people were killed during a siege lasting nearly 12 hours, police said, prompting the government to sack two top security officials over their failure to stop repeated attacks. the attack proved once again that insurgents can carry out deadly assaults in the heart of the somali capital. twin bombings in mogadishu two weeks ago killed more than 350 people, the worst such attacks in the country s history. more than 50 people are still missing. islamist militants al shabaab claimed responsibility for  this weekend s attack, which took place ahead of a planned meeting to try to defuse tensions between the federal government and regional states. government officials had begun to meet at the hotel to discuss strategy.   so far i am sure 29 people died   the death toll may rise,  abdullahi nur, a police officer, told reuters. at least 12 of the dead were police officers, nur said. a woman was beheaded while her  three children were shot dead , he said. a reuters witness saw seven bodies lying inside the hotel. (click tmsnrt.rs/2gtg1ds for a graphic showing map where explosion took place) three militants were captured alive and two others blew themselves up after they were shot, police said. some militants may have disguised themselves and escaped with the residents who were rescued from the hotel, one police officer said. the attack began around at 5 p.m. on saturday when a car bomb rammed the gates of nasahablod two hotel, which is close to the presidential palace, and destroyed the hotel s defenses. then gunmen stormed the building. the explosion destroyed the front of the three storey hotel and damaged the hotel next door. many somali officials live in fortified hotels for the security they offer.  the attack presents a further challenge to the new government of president mohamed abdullahi mohamed, whose defense minister and chief of army staff resigned this month. they did not give their reasons for leaving.  on sunday, the government sacked the country s police commander, abdihakin dahir saiid, and the director general of the national intelligence security agency, abdullahi mohamed ali, the prime minister s office announced. abdikadir abdirahman, director of amin ambulances, complained the emergency service had been denied access to the blast sight.   after the hotel operation was over, we wanted to transport the casualties ... all entrances of the scene were blocked by security forces. al shabaab said 40 people had been killed, including three of its fighters who stormed the hotel. the government and al shabaab typically give different figures for victims in such attacks.  the twin bombings in mogadishu on oct. 14 killed at least 358 people and ignited nationwide outrage. al shabaab has not claimed responsibility for that attack, but the method    a large truck bomb   is one it has often used. the militant group wants to overthrow the weak, u.n. backed government and impose a strict form of islamic law.

" the united states would  badly  like to lift sanctions against russia but will not do so until moscow has pulled its forces out of eastern ukraine and crimea, secretary of state rex tillerson said on thursday, calling that the main obstacle to normal ties. tillerson is on a visit to europe during which he has reassured allies with tougher rhetoric against moscow than that of u.s. president donald trump, who has sought better relations with russian president vladimir putin. speaking at a meeting of the organization for security and cooperation in europe (osce), also attended by his russian counterpart, tillerson said moscow was to blame for increased violence in eastern ukraine and that had to stop.  we ve made this clear to russia from the very beginning, that we must address ukraine,  tillerson told a news conference with his austrian counterpart sebastian kurz.  it stands as the single most difficult obstacle to us renormalizing the relationship with russia, which we badly would like to do.  on wednesday, tillerson met nato foreign ministers and criticized russia for the mix of state sponsored computer hacks and internet disinformation campaigns that nato allies  intelligence agencies say is targeted at the west. the conflict between ukrainian forces and russian backed separatists in eastern ukraine has claimed more than 10,000 lives since it erupted in 2014. russia denies accusations that it fomented the conflict and provided arms and fighters. russian foreign minister sergei lavrov told the osce conference that  all the responsibility is with ukraine  as far as violence in the east was concerned. in his speech to the gathering, tillerson went even further in spelling out russia s involvement in the conflict and the consequences it faced than he had the day before in brussels.   we should be clear about the source of this violence,  tillerson said, referring to increasing ceasefire violations recorded by osce monitors in eastern ukraine.  russia is arming, leading, training and fighting alongside anti government forces. we call on russia and its proxies to end its harassment, intimidation and its attacks on the osce special monitoring mission.  while both sides have called for a u.n. peacekeeping force in eastern ukraine, they disagree on the terms of its deployment, and there was little sign of concrete progress at thursday s meeting.  we will continue to work with russia to see if we could not agree a peacekeeping force that could enter ukraine (and) reduce the violence,  tillerson told the news conference. he and lavrov met on the sidelines of the conference, though both ignored reporters  questions when the meeting began. asked later what commitments he had received at the meeting, tillerson said:  i m not going to tell you specifically what we get. we get progress, that s what we get. we get dialogue, we get cooperation, we don t have it solved. you don t solve it in one meeting.   in his speech, he referred to the 2015 minsk ceasefire agreement, brokered in the belarussian capital by france, germany, russia and ukraine.  in eastern ukraine, we join our european partners in maintaining sanctions until russia withdraws its forces from the donbass (region) and meets its minsk commitments,  tillerson said. he also made clear that washington did not accept russia s seizure of the crimean peninsula from ukraine in 2014.  we will never accept russia s occupation and attempted annexation of crimea. crimea related sanctions will remain in place until russia returns full control of the peninsula to ukraine,  he said.

" california governor jerry brown announced on tuesday that state lawmakers had reached an agreement about the state’s 2017 2018  budget.  both houses of the state legislature will likely vote on the new budget on thursday, the constitutional deadline for lawmakers to adopt a budget bill. california’s department of finance had not totaled the final budget numbers as of tuesday morning, according to department spokesperson h.d. palmer. the budget adds $1.8 billion to the state’s rainy day fund, expands access to california’s earned income tax credit and boosts funding for schools and infrastructure repairs, according to the governor’s office. it also sends more money to the nation’s largest public pension fund, california public employees’ retirement system (calpers), to help reduce the fund’s unfunded liability. “this budget keeps california on a sound fiscal path and continues to support struggling families and make investments in our schools,” brown said in a statement on tuesday.  “this budget makes historic investments in healthcare, education, and childcare, and lays down a multi billion dollar investment to start fixing our roads and infrastructure,” said senate president pro tem kevin de león. brown proposed a state budget in january for the new fiscal year and revised his budget up 2.2 percent to $183.4 billion in may.

" u.s. presidential candidate donald trump thrust himself into the heart of britain’s vote to leave the european union on friday, calling it a “great” development and drawing parallels to his own insurgent campaign. in scotland to reopen a golf resort he owns, the wealthy new york businessman wasted no time interpreting the outcome of the “brexit” vote as an example of a global uprising against the established order. it’s an argument he said fit in with his own campaign to shake up washington by renegotiating free trade deals and stopping illegal immigration. “people want to take their country back. they want to have independence in a sense. you see it with europe, all over europe,” trump, 70, the presumptive republican nominee, told a news conference at the trump turnberry golf course.  he said the economic shock from the vote would ebb over time and that more european countries might want to break with the 28 nation european union. americans, he said, would have a chance “to re declare their independence” and “reject today’s rule by the global elite” when they vote on nov. 8. “so i think you’re going to have this happen more and more. i really believe that, and i think that it’s happening in the united states. it’s happening by the fact that i’ve done so well in the polls,” he said. trump’s rival, democratic candidate hillary clinton, said in a statement: “this time of uncertainty only underscores the need for calm, steady, experienced leadership in the white house to protect americans’ pocketbooks and livelihoods, to support our friends and allies, to stand up to our adversaries, and to defend our interests.   “it also underscores the need for us to pull together to solve our challenges as a country, not tear each other down,” said clinton, 68, a former u.s. secretary of state, who had openly favored britain’s remaining in the eu.     more than half a million britons signed a petition earlier this year to bar trump from entering britain, where he has business interests, in response to his call to temporarily ban muslims from entering the united states. british lawmakers decided against a ban as a violation of free speech. trump assailed as inappropriate democratic president barack obama’s open appeals to britain not to split off. shaking off a tradition of not commenting on u.s. politics from foreign soil, trump said obama had been embarrassed. “it’s something he shouldn’t have done. it’s not his country. it’s not his part of the world. he shouldn’t have done it. and i actually think that his recommendation perhaps caused it to fail,” trump said. democrats and republicans both took stock of a decision that seemed to indicate trump’s campaign had tapped into a global wave that might be hard to contain. joined by his sons don jr. and eric and daughter ivanka, who help manage his business affairs, trump arrived in his signature helicopter near his clubhouse resort, a scottish flag blowing in the wind. the candidate praised his children’s business acumen, his scottish born mother and the golf course itself, dismissing complaints from republicans that he should have stuck to the campaign trail at home. as it happened, by turning up when he did, trump drew global televised attention to his views on the brexit vote within hours of britons waking up to the surprising result. “i said this was going to happen and i think that it’s a great thing,” said trump, who weeks ago said he would be inclined to leave the eu. trump had exchanged insults with british prime minister david cameron, who supported staying in the eu and said on friday after the vote he would resign by october. cameron had called trump’s anti immigrant policy ideas divisive and wrong. “i think david cameron is a good man. he was wrong on this.  he didn’t get the mood of his country right. he was surprised,” trump said, predicting that britain and the united states would remain “great allies.” wearing a white hat emblazoned with his “make america great again” campaign slogan, trump walked up to the news conference with bagpipers heralding his arrival. his visit to turnberry, to be followed by a stop at his resort in aberdeen on saturday, coincided with a vote that exposed deep divisions in britain and dealt the biggest blow to the european project of greater unity since world war two. some scots who are turnberry members and who sat in the front row at trump’s news conference muttered “no” whenever the subject of scotland leaving the eu came up. scotland voted by a margin of 62 percent to 38 percent to remain in the eu, a result sharply at odds with britain as a whole, which voted 52 percent to 48 percent to leave. trump, who has yet to hold public office and rates unfavorably with 70 percent of americans in an opinion poll, defeated a crowded field of opponents for the republican nomination while weathering one controversy after another. the latest was over the firing of his campaign manager this week, a month before the party convention. trump invested $290 million in renovating the resort and golf course on scotland’s west coast, 85 km (53 miles) southwest of glasgow.

" michigan governor rick snyder has met with wall street credit rating agencies this week, telling them michigan’s economy is doing “very well” in the face of a lowered credit outlook, snyder said on thursday.  “we had a good, healthy discussion,” snyder told reuters after speaking at a cuny graduate school of journalism event in new york city. “michigan economically is doing very well.” two weeks ago, just before michigan’s most recent bond offering, standard & poor’s ratings services lowered the outlook on michigan’s credit rating to stable from positive. it cited burgeoning costs associated with a lead tainted water crisis in the city of flint and with the cash strapped detroit public schools (dps).  those rising expenses “will limit the state’s ability to build reserves over the nest two fiscal years,” s&p analyst carol spain said on march 17. despite the outlook change, michigan was able to sell about $82 billion of general obligation bonds with a true interest cost of 1.54 percent, showing little sign that the u.s. municipal bond market wanted to punish the state with exorbitantly high interest rates. one encouraging economic sign in michigan is the 4.8 percent unemployment rate reported in february versus the national jobless rate of 4.9 percent. snyder said it was a good time to meet with credit rating agencies because the state is not currently in the market. he tries to do it at least once a year.

" republican donald trump on thursday said he would accept a “clear” election result but reserved the right to file a legal challenge, clarifying his stance a day after he refused to promise he would trust the outcome if he loses on nov. 8. “of course, i would accept a clear election result, but i would also reserve my right to contest or file a legal challenge in the case of a questionable result,” trump said at a rally in ohio. asked on wednesday at his final debate with democrat hillary clinton if he would accept a losing outcome, trump said he would “keep you in suspense.” ",0
" u.s. president donald trump will not necessarily insist on including funding for a border wall with mexico in legislation to address protections for children brought to the united states illegally, a senior aide said on tuesday. white house legislative director marc short, speaking to reporters at a christian science monitor breakfast, said the administration will lay out its priorities for a fix for the deferred action on childhood arrivals (daca) program in the next couple of weeks. while trump remains committed to his campaign promise to build the wall along the u.s. border with mexico, “whether or not that is specifically part of a daca package or a different legislative package, i am not going to prejudge here today,” short said. “i don’t want to bind ourselves into a construct that makes reaching a conclusion on daca impossible,” short said. short’s comments were the latest signal that the republican president wants to see if he can engage democrats as well as republicans in trying to enact his agenda. on tuesday evening, he is scheduled to have dinner with a bipartisan group of senators whose support he hopes to win on legislation to overhaul the tax code. democrats welcomed short’s daca comments, saying they cleared away a major stumbling to legislation to help daca recipients, known as dreamers. democrats have insisted they will not allow border funding to be part of any legislation and would likely have the votes in the senate to block a provision to which they objected. “that’s an important position because we cannot make a 2,200 mile (3,540 km) wall a condition for passing the dream act and we’ve been very clear from the start,” said senator dick durbin, a senior democrat who has been working for the past 16 years to legislate protections for the dreamers. democrats are willing to work with the white house and congressional republicans on other border security measures as part of the legislation, durbin added. but mark krikorian, executive director of the center for immigration studies, which seeks to limit legal and illegal immigration, criticized the potential shift on daca, saying the white house forfeited leverage it needs to tighten border enforcement. krikorian said the administration seemed to be looking for an “escape hatch” on the controversial daca program. “it does suggest how much trump wants this daca issue to go away,” he said. trump said last week he was ending an obama era program that protects from the deportation of immigrants brought illegally into the united states as children, but he gave u.s. lawmakers six months to act on the issue. the move put the onus on congress to address the nearly 800,000 dreamers now facing uncertainty about their status in a country that for many is the only one they have known.

" a fraud trial against the brother and son of guatemalan president jimmy morales began on wednesday amid a scandal touched off by the president s attempt to expel the leader of a u.n. backed anti corruption unit investigating the case. guatemala s top tribunal, the constitutional court, ruled definitively on tuesday against morales  internationally criticized push to expel from the country ivan velasquez, the colombian who leads the international commission against impunity in guatemala (cicig).[nl8n1lf4ry] the cicig and the prosecutor s office accuse samuel  sammy  morales, the president s brother and one of his closest advisers, and jose manuel morales, one of the leader s four sons, of facilitating false receipts that defrauded the national property registry in 2013, two years before morales was elected. they deny any wrongdoing. neither of the two gave a declaration before a judge on wednesday, where they appeared together with another 20 other defendants. the scandal has hurt the popularity of jimmy morales, a former comedian, who won election in late 2015 after riding a wave of public discontent over the corruption scandals that brought down his predecessor otto perez molina. the president has said the investigation into his family was not related to his controversial decision to declare velasquez  persona non grata.  last week, velasquez and guatemalan attorney general thelma aldana asked to remove morales  immunity, in order to investigate him for accusations of illegal campaign financing. the case involves payments linked to the mother of jose manuel morales  then girlfriend in 2013. she allegedly sent the national property registry a $12,000 bill made out in the name of a local restaurant for 564 breakfasts, according to the attorney general. the breakfasts were never delivered. samuel morales recognized the acts as a  favor  to his nephew, but he denied that he had benefited or been implicated in the network of fraud that deprived the institution of thousands of dollars. both were detained in january, then put under house arrest and barred from leaving the country.

" egypt will raise the price of tickets on cairo s loss making metro system from next july, tripling the present fare for many commuters, the state owned newspaper al ahram said on sunday. commuters will be charged a base fare of 2 egyptian pounds  (11 u.s. cents) for the first 9 stops, and an additional pound for 9 more stations, the newspaper, quoting transport minister hisham arafat, said.  a maximum fare of 6 egyptian pounds will be charged for commuters who ride one line from start to finish, though discounted rates for government workers and students will be maintained. currently, commuters can cover an unlimited number of stops and can even switch lines for the same base fare of 2 egyptian pounds. the move comes as part of an effort by the transport authority to cover operational costs after the floatation of the egyptian pound, the newspaper said. the government angered cairo residents, already hit by a sharp rise in living costs, when it doubled the price of metro tickets in march for millions of commuters, an increase which followed losses of 500 million egyptian pounds which have put the network at risk, media reported in march.

" a second federal judge has taken the rare step of allowing a group suing for records from hillary clinton’s time as u.s. secretary of state to seek sworn testimony from officials, saying there was “evidence of government wrong doing and bad faith.” the language in judge royce lamberth’s order undercut the democratic presidential contender’s assertion she was allowed to set up a private email server in her home for her work as the country’s top diplomat and that the arrangement was not particularly unusual. he described clinton’s email arrangement as “extraordinary” in his order filed on tuesday in federal district court in washington. referring to the state department, clinton and clinton’s aides, he said there had been “constantly shifting admissions by the government and the former government officials.” spokesmen for clinton did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  the case is a civil matter, but the order adds to the legal uncertainty that has overshadowed clinton’s campaign to be the democratic nominee in the nov. 8 presidential election. the fbi is also conducting a criminal inquiry into the arrangement after it emerged that classified government secrets ended up in clinton’s unsecured email account. clinton has said she does not think she will be charged with a crime.  lamberth’s order granted the request by judicial watch, a conservative watchdog group suing the department under open records laws, to gather evidence, including sworn testimony. the group has filed several lawsuits, including one seeking records about the 2012 attack in benghazi, libya, that killed u.s. ambassador christopher stevens and three other americans. “where there is evidence of government wrong doing and bad faith, as here, limited discovery is appropriate, even though it is exceedingly rare in foia (freedom of information) cases,” lamberth noted in his order. the government is normally given the benefit of the doubt that it properly searched and produced records.  since the email arrangement came to public knowledge a year ago, the state department has found itself defending clinton in scores of lawsuits from groups, individuals and news outlets who say they were wrongly denied access to clinton’s federal records. clinton left the department in 2013, but did not return her email records to the government until nearly two years later.  last month, judge emmet sullivan, who is overseeing a separate judicial watch lawsuit over other clinton related records, allowed a similar motion for discovery.

" the republican controlled u.s. house of representatives, under mounting pressure to advance gun control legislation, will vote next week on a measure to keep guns out of the hands of people on government terrorism watch lists. republican and gun lobby sources said the legislation, due to be introduced as part of a terrorism package, was likely to be a national rifle association backed bill brought by representative lee zeldin of new york as the companion to a senate republican measure from senator john cornyn of texas. house democrats, who last week staged a 25 hour sit in on the house floor to push for gun control after the june 12 mass shooting in orlando, condemned the cornyn zeldin measure as the handiwork of the nra. senate democrats blocked the same legislation last week.   “house democrats will keep up our efforts to push for the majority to allow a vote on gun violence legislation, but bringing up a bill authored by the nra just isn’t going to cut it,” said drew hammill, an aide to house democratic leader nancy pelosi. the nra denied writing the legislation.  house speaker paul ryan announced the plan in a conference call with lawmakers. republican leadership aides declined to provide details. one said the package was still being negotiated. after the orlando, florida, shooting that killed 49 people and wounded 53 more at a gay nightclub [nl1n19l1wh], gun control proponents ratcheted up pressure for meaningful legislation.  “we are going to get something done this year, i predict,” senate democratic leader harry reid told reporters. “i think we’re going to take a bite out of the nra.” reid said he was hopeful for a bill introduced by republican senator susan collins of maine, and a bipartisan house companion bill backed by republicans including representative carlos curbelo of florida, to prevent gun sales to anyone on the government’s “no fly list” for terrorism suspects or the “selectee list” for extra airport screening.   before thursday’s announcement, representative bob dold of illinois, a republican backer of the collins curbelo bill, urged ryan and house majority leader kevin mccarthy to opt for the bipartisan measure, according to a dold aide. but hopes for a vote on that measure could be dashed if house republicans move first on the cornyn zeldin bill, which would allow party leaders to say they had acted on gun control.   “it would really be a sharp blow,” said representative scott rigell, a virginia republican and nra member who supports the collins curbelo measure. the nra backed measure would give officials three days to decide whether a gun sale should be blocked. democrats argue the timetable is insufficient and say the government would have to persuade a court that a would be buyer “has committed or will commit an act of terrorism” before it could block a gun sale. under the collins curbelo bills, a court would have 14 days to decide on appeals.

" chancellor angela merkel s conservatives said they were willing to open formal talks on forming a government with germany s social democrats (spd)   but her chosen partner was expected to take two more days to decide how to proceed. weakened by heavy election losses to the far right and then by the collapse last month of talks on a three way alliance, merkel is pinning her hopes on the spd for a fourth term as chancellor and to avoid new elections. leaders of merkel s christian democrats (cdu) and her bavarian conservative allies (csu) sought to persuade their spd counterparts to drop their objections to a renewal of the  grand coalition  the two parties have been governing in since 2013.  the cdu and csu representatives made clear that they wanted to begin exploratory talks with the spd on creating a stable government,  the conservative camp said in a statement. but an spd official said the party first needed to hold consultations before announcing a decision on friday. after four years of governing with merkel, the center left party scored its worst election result since 1933   and few members want to repeat that experience. sensing that merkel s lack of alternatives leaves it in a strong position, the spd has said it would agree to share power only if it wins commitments on more generous social policy.  a decisive point for the spd is that the social agenda has more prominence in germany,  leading social democrat carsten schneider told german television ahead of the talks, demanding  fairness for ordinary heroes.  but the mood between the two parties is still sour and merkel herself has been a frequent target of criticism by the social democrats. the secrecy surrounding the talks underlined their sensitivity. with both sides having a lot to lose, the parties plan no public statements when talks conclude on wednesday evening. spd leader martin schulz has made a pitch for eu integration leading to a  united states of europe  by 2025, and the spd wants a big spending boost on education, more nursery spots and a big healthcare reform. merkel wants to maintain germany s solid finances, cut some taxes and expand the digital infrastructure.  the spd had vowed to go into opposition after its dismal election result and only softened its approach, agreeing to meet merkel, due to pressure from president frank walter steinmeier, who wants to avoid new elections. the spd pulled no punches in attacking merkel during the election campaign. schulz has described merkel, known for pragmatism rather than vision, as a vacuum cleaner of ideas and has also accused her of silencing debate on issues.  a row last month over a conservative minister breaking protocol to back an extension for an eu license for a weed killer despite spd opposition hurt ties at a crucial time.    one of the spd s deputies, ralf stegner, adopted a combative tone on wednesday, saying nobody could dictate the terms to the spd as the conservative bloc needed the party to rule.  some in the spd are prepared to contemplate another grand coalition, albeit with a clear spd signature, but others prefer the idea of tolerating a minority government under merkel.  one other option is a  koko  (cooperation coalition) agreement under which the spd would agree to work with merkel in some areas, such as the budget and european and foreign affairs, but force her to seek ad hoc majorities for other policies. this idea is unpopular with conservatives who prefer a grand coalition.  we have to try it   but please, seriously,  carsten linnemann, head of a group representing small and medium sized businesses in the conservative bloc, told ard television.

"the obama administration plans to announce on thursday a series of retaliatory measures against russia for hacking into u.s. political institutions and individuals and leaking information in an effort to help president-elect donald trump and other republican candidates, two u.s. officials said on wednesday.both officials declined to specify what actions president barack obama has approved, but said targeted economic sanctions, indictments, leaking information to embarrass russian officials or oligarchs, and restrictions on russian diplomats in the united states are among steps that have been discussed.one decision that has been made, they said, speaking on the condition of anonymity, is to avoid any moves that exceed the russian election hacking and risk an escalating cyber conflict that could spiral out of control. one example of an excessive step might be interfering with russian internet messaging.russia has repeatedly denied hacking accusations. trump has dismissed the assessments of the u.s. intelligence community.obama, in an interview earlier this month with npr, said,  we need to take action and we will  against russia for interfering in the u.s. election.trump seemed to suggest the united states should not impose sanctions on russia. i think we ought to get on with our lives,  trump told reporters in florida on wednesday when asked about remarks by republican senator lindsey graham, who said russia and president vladimir putin should expect tough sanctions for the cyber attacks.russia s foreign ministry spokeswoman, maria zakharova, promised retaliation on wednesday against washington in the event of new economic sanctions.jim lewis, a cyber security expert with the center for strategic and international studies think tank, said further sanctions may be an effective u.s. tool in part because they would be difficult for trump to roll back and because russia  hates  dealing with them. for the rest of the world, it s like having  scumball  stamped on your forehead,  lewis said.how to respond to the growing problem of cyber attacks carried out or sponsored by foreign powers has bedeviled obama, whose eight years in office witnessed a torrent of major hacks against the u.s. government and private organizations that were attributed to china, north korea, iran and russia.in past cases, administration officials have decided to publicly blame north korea and indict members of china s military for hacking because they decided the net benefit of public shaming   and increased awareness brought to cyber security   outweighed potential risks.but determining an appropriate response to russia s actions has proven more complicated in part because russia s cyber capabilities are more advanced and due to fears about disrupting other geopolitical issues, such as the civil war in syria.obama may choose to invoke an april 2015 executive order that empowered him to levy sanctions in response to cyber attacks perpetrated by foreign groups targeting infrastructure, such as transportation, or done for economic purposes.another option would be further economic sanctions against russia. washington has already sanctioned russia over the past two years to punish moscow for its role in annexing crimea. but former u.s. officials say the existing measures leave washington plenty of room to slap new, tougher sanction on russia in response to cyber intrusions.  reutersin recent months, wikileaks and i personally have come under enormous pressure to stop publishing what the clinton campaign says about itself to itself. that pressure has come from the campaign s allies, including the obama administration, and from liberals who are anxious about who will be elected us president.on the eve of the election, it is important to restate why we have published what we have.the right to receive and impart true information is the guiding principle of wikileaks   an organization that has a staff and organizational mission far beyond myself. our organization defends the public s right to be informed.this is why, irrespective of the outcome of the 2016 us presidential election, the real victor is the us public which is better informed as a result of our work.the us public has thoroughly engaged with wikileaks  election related publications which number more than one hundred thousand documents. millions of americans have pored over the leaks and passed on their citations to each other and to us. it is an open model of journalism that gatekeepers are uncomfortable with, but which is perfectly harmonious with the first amendment.we publish material given to us if it is of political, diplomatic, historical or ethical importance and which has not been published elsewhere. when we have material that fulfills this criteria, we publish. we had information that fit our editorial criteria which related to the sanders and clinton campaign (dnc leaks) and the clinton political campaign and foundation (podesta emails). no-one disputes the public importance of these publications. it would be unconscionable for wikileaks to withhold such an archive from the public during an election.at the same time, we cannot publish what we do not have. to date, we have not received information on donald trump s campaign, or jill stein s campaign, or gary johnson s campaign or any of the other candidates that fufills our stated editorial criteria. as a result of publishing clinton s cables and indexing her emails we are seen as domain experts on clinton archives. so it is natural that clinton sources come to us.we publish as fast as our resources will allow and as fast as the public can absorb it.that is our commitment to ourselves, to our sources, and to the public.this is not due to a personal desire to influence the outcome of the election. the democratic and republican candidates have both expressed hostility towards whistleblowers. i spoke at the launch of the campaign for jill stein, the green party candidate, because her platform addresses the need to protect them. this is an issue that is close to my heart because of the obama administration s inhuman and degrading treatment of one of our alleged sources, chelsea manning. but wikileaks publications are not an attempt to get jill stein elected or to take revenge over ms manning s treatment either.publishing is what we do. to withhold the publication of such information until after the election would have been to favour one of the candidates above the public s right to know.this is after all what happened when the new york times withheld evidence of illegal mass surveillance of the us population for a year until after the 2004 election, denying the public a critical understanding of the incumbent president george w bush, which probably secured his reelection. the current editor of the new york times has distanced himself from that decision and rightly so.the us public defends free speech more passionately, but the first amendment only truly lives through its repeated exercise. the first amendment explicitly prevents the executive from attempting to restrict anyone s ability to speak and publish freely. the first amendment does not privilege old media, with its corporate advertisers and dependencies on incumbent power factions, over wikileaks  model of scientific journalism or an individual s decision to inform their friends on social media. the first amendment unapologetically nurtures the democratization of knowledge. with the internet, it has reached its full potential.yet, some weeks ago, in a tactic reminiscent of senator mccarthy and the red scare, wikileaks, green party candidate stein, glenn greenwald and clinton s main opponent were painted with a broad, red brush. the clinton campaign, when they were not spreading obvious untruths, pointed to unnamed sources or to speculative and vague statements from the intelligence community to suggest a nefarious allegiance with russia. the campaign was unable to invoke evidence about our publications because none exists.in the end, those who have attempted to malign our groundbreaking work over the past four months seek to inhibit public understanding perhaps because it is embarrassing to them   a reason for censorship the first amendment cannot tolerate. only unsuccessfully do they try to claim that our publications are inaccurate.wikileaks  decade-long pristine record for authentication remains. our key publications this round have even been proven through the cryptographic signatures of the companies they passed through, such as google. it is not every day you can mathematically prove that your publications are perfect but this day is one of them.we have endured intense criticism, primarily from clinton supporters, for our publications. many long-term supporters have been frustrated because we have not addressed this criticism in a systematic way or responded to a number of false narratives about wikileaks  motivation or sources. ultimately, however, if wl reacted to every false claim, we would have to divert resources from our primary work.wikileaks, like all publishers, is ultimately accountable to its funders. those funders are you. our resources are entirely made up of contributions from the public and our book sales. this allows us to be principled, independent and free in a way no other influential media organization is. but it also means that we do not have the resources of cnn, msnbc or the clinton campaign to constantly rebuff criticism.yet if the press obeys considerations above informing the public, we are no longer talking about a free press, and we are no longer talking about an informed public.wikileaks remains committed to publishing information that informs the public, even if many, especially those in power, would prefer not to see it. wikileaks must publish. it must publish and be damned.",1
" iran, u.s. allies in europe and russia on friday defended the 2015 nuclear agreement with tehran and said they would stick by it, after u.s. president donald trump threatened to terminate the agreement. trump said in a washington speech that he would not certify that iran is complying with its agreement with six world powers and the european union, despite a determination by the u.n. s nuclear watchdog that tehran is meeting the deal s terms. the republican president threw the issue to the u.s. congress, which has 60 days to decide whether to reinstate u.s. sanctions. he warned that if  we are not able to reach a solution working with congress and our allies, then the agreement will be terminated.  trump s actions appeared to leave the united states relatively isolated on the world stage. his hawkish new stance toward iran, including steps against the islamic revolutionary guard corps, received strong backing only from israel and gulf states such as saudi arabia. iranian president hassan rouhani said iran will remain committed to the multinational deal as long as it serves the country s national interests. trump s decision to decertify the deal will isolate the united states, as other signatories of the accord remained committed to it, rouhani said in a live television address. the deal was not renegotiable, he said. the agreement, negotiated by trump s democratic predecessor barack obama, eased sanctions on tehran in returns for strict limits on its nuclear program. trump s stance put him at odds with key u.s. allies, including britain, france and germany who, along with russia and china, negotiated the deal with iran alongside the european union. in brussels, eu foreign policy chief federica mogherini said washington could not unilaterally cancel the agreement.  we cannot afford as the international community to dismantle a nuclear agreement that is working,  said mogherini, who chaired the final stages of the landmark talks.  this deal is not a bilateral agreement.  the international community, and the european union with it, has clearly indicated that the deal is, and will continue to be, in place,  mogherini told reporters in brussels. the leaders of britain, france and germany issued a joint statement warning the united states against taking decisions that could harm the nuclear deal such as re imposing sanctions. the three leaders also said they shared u.s. concerns over iran s ballistic missile program and regional destabilizing activities and were ready to work with washington to address those concerns. french president emmanuel macron s office said he had spoken with rouhani by telephone and assured him of france s commitment to the deal, but that tehran must strictly comply with it. russia s foreign ministry said there was no place in international diplomacy for threatening and aggressive rhetoric, and said such methods were doomed to fail, in a statement issued after trump s speech. the ministry said trump s decision to de certify the deal would not have a direct impact on implementation of the agreement but that it ran counter to its spirit. there was no immediate reaction from china, though alexei pushkov, a pro kremlin lawmaker in the upper house of the russian parliament, said neither moscow nor beijing backed trump s stance.  russia of course does not support the u.s. position, nor does china. so trump will be left in proud isolation in an attempt to improve his image among his own supporters,  pushkov told russia s state run rossiya 24 tv station.  the head of the u.n. s international atomic energy agency said iran was complying with the accord, formally known as the joint comprehensive plan of action, under the world s  most robust nuclear verification regime.   the nuclear related commitments undertaken by iran under  the jcpoa are being implemented,  yukiya amano, director general of the iaea said in a statement.  what has been agreed ... must be fully implemented. it is a very important deal, i m sorry to see what is now happening,  former united nations secretary general ban ki moon told reporters at the united nations on friday. ban, who stepped down at the end of 2016, was u.n. chief when the deal was agreed. trump received support from israel, saudi arabia, the united arab emirates and bahrain, all of which oppose what they say are iran s expansionary moves in the middle east.  president trump has just created an opportunity to fix this bad deal, to roll back iran s aggression and to confront its criminal support of terrorism,  israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu said in a video statement. in their comments, the gulf states focused on trump s overall iran policy rather than the nuclear deal itself. saudi arabia welcomed what it called trump s  decisive strategy  toward iran and said lifting sanctions had allowed tehran to develop its ballistic missile program, step up its support for militant groups including hezbollah and the houthis in yemen, and attack global shipping lanes.   the riyadh government said in a statement it had supported the nuclear agreement,  but iran took advantage of the economic gain from raising sanctions and used it to continue destabilizing the region . the united arab emirates said it fully supported the new u.s. policy toward iran and renewed its commitment to work with washington to counter iran s support of extremism, the state news agency wam reported.  the uae announces its full support to the new u.s. strategy to deal with the iranian policies undermining security and  stability,  wam said on its twitter account.

" years before donald trump dominated the news cycle with his style of angry politics, maine governor paul lepage made headlines with a similarly brash approach. since he was elected in 2010, the republican has told critics of his decision to skip a civil rights breakfast to “kiss my butt” and accused a democratic rival of forcing budget measures on taxpayers “without vaseline.” but when lepage, the second u.s. governor to endorse trump, recently left an obscenity laced voicemail message for a lawmaker who he believed had called him a racist, he put his career in jeopardy. lepage’s widely circulated verbal attack, in which he called democratic state representative drew gattine a “little son of a bitch, socialist cocksucker,” sparked the most intense firestorm of criticism the second term governor has seen. even legislative leaders from his own party called him into a closed door meeting to discuss his future. the reaction shows that not all politicians can get away with the kind of bellicose approach that helped trump wipe out his primary rivals and win the support of angry voters who feel u.s. politicians do not care about their problems. “trump is a master of media and lepage is not. they are very different at the end of the day,” said michael franz, chairman of the government and legal studies department at maine’s bowdoin college. “trump says he hates the media, but he works it very well. lepage just hates it.” the governor infamously joked in 2013 that he would like to blow up the offices of the portland press herald newspaper, which he felt treated him unfairly. on wednesday, lepage told reporters he had met with gattine and apologized, and that he had no plans to resign from office. asked what might change about his governing style, lepage responded that he would no longer speak with reporters. “i will no longer speak to the press ever again after today,” lepage said. “i’m serious. everything will be put in writing. i am tired of being caught, the gotcha moments.” that came a day after lepage openly discussed the idea of stepping down in a regular monthly interview with a maine radio station. he later backed away from his comments, and paraphrasing mark twain, said in a twitter post, “the reports of my political demise are greatly exaggerated.” lepage endorsed trump’s run in february, shortly after new jersey governor chris christie did.  “i was donald trump before donald trump became popular,” lepage said at the time, saying that the wealthy new york businessman and reality tv star “could be one of the greatest presidents if he sits down and puts together a good team.” trump has also praised lepage, saying that he would offer him a role in his administration “if he were available.” both men describe their political styles as authentic and off the cuff and accuse more measured rivals of being career politicians who are out of touch with the needs of average voters. lepage’s brusqueness played well in maine until recently. he won re election in a three way 2014 race with the support of 48 percent of voters with a wider margin of victory than the 38 percent he garnered in his first run, also a three way race. neil levesque, executive director of the new hampshire institute of politics said that success, coupled with trump’s rise, could have emboldened lepage to double down on attack politics. “almost anything goes now. you can call your opponents almost anything, you can threaten them,” levesque said. “this is the new norm in american politics.” ",0
" the european union will not transfer a final tranche of loans worth 28 million euros ($33 million) to support moldovan justice reforms as the authorities have not fulfilled the required conditions, the eu delegation to moldova said on wednesday. the european union is the ex soviet nation s largest external donor, but payments have been frozen or repeatedly delayed by slow reform progress and political upheaval.  the eu has closely observed the reform process and noted that the moldovan authorities showed insufficient commitment to reforming the justice sector,  the delegation said in an online statement.  the moldovan authorities have not fulfilled the eu s conditions for receiving the last financial transfer under the justice reform program, which amounts to 28 million euros,  it said. the disbursement of other eu funding, including a 100 million euro ($117 million) macro financial assistance package of loans and grants for 2017 2018, has also been delayed. last week, prime minister pavel filip said moldova would not receive any financing under the agreement this year. the eu has said a basic precondition for the financial assistance is a respect for the democratic process and the rule of law. nevertheless moldova this year introduced a new electoral law that a pan european rights body ruled could make the system more susceptible to undue influence by vested interests. moldova s economy grew 4.1 percent last year, recovering from a contraction of 0.4 percent in 2015 due in part to an economic crisis in nearby russia that hit exports and remittances from moldovans working there. the country, europe s poorest, has also been rocked by a scandal that saw the equivalent of an eighth of its gross domestic product stolen from three of its largest banks between 2012 2014. the world bank and international monetary fund have forecast growth of between 4 and 4.5 percent in 2017.

" the u.s. navy on monday confirmed recovery of the remains of all  10 sailors killed after the warship john s. mccain collided with a merchant vessel in waters near singapore and malaysia.  the guided missile destroyer collided with the alnic mc east of singapore last week while approaching the city state on a routine port visit.  the u.s. navy and marine corps divers have now recovered the remains of all 10 uss john s.mccain sailors,  the seventh fleet said in a statement on its website.  the news follows the navy s thursday announcement that it had suspended wider search and rescue operations after finding and identifying the remains of one sailor. the navy found the remains of missing sailors inside sealed sections of the damaged hull of the warship, which is moored at singapore s changi naval base.  the incident is under investigation to determine the facts and circumstances of the collision,  the statement added. aircraft, divers and vessels from australia, indonesia, malaysia, singapore, and the united states joined a search and rescue operation for the missing sailors over an area of about 5,500 sq. km. (2,124 square miles) around the crash site. the pre dawn collision, the fourth major accident for the u.s. pacific fleet this year, has prompted a review of its operations. the navy has removed seventh fleet commander vice admiral joseph aucoin from his post, citing  a loss of confidence in his ability to command  after the run of accidents. rear admiral phil sawyer takes command of the fleet from aucoin, who had been due to step down next month.  the u.s. navy has also flagged plans for temporary and staggered halts in operations across its global fleet to allow staff to focus on safety. in a one day operational pause last wednesday, officers and crew of seventh fleet ships deployed at a facility in yokosuka, japan, received fresh training in risk management and communications. the seventh fleet, headquartered in japan, operates as many as 70 ships, including the u.s. navy s only forward deployed aircraft carrier, and has about 140 aircraft and 20,000 sailors.

" saudi arabia s corruption investigations are linked to a just few individuals and will not hinder investments in the kingdom, its energy minister said on thursday. khalid al falih said the crackdown was way overdue and would also not have any impact on plans to float shares in oil giant saudi aramco.   everybody understands that this is a limited, domestic affair that the government is simply cleaning house,  he said on the sidelines of the u.n. climate conference in bonn, germany. saudi arabia s future king has tightened his grip on power through an anti corruption purge by arresting royals, ministers and investors including billionaire alwaleed bin talal who is one of the kingdom s most prominent businessmen. the move by prince mohammed bin salman against saudi s political and business elite also targeted the head of the national guard, prince miteb bin abdullah, who was detained and replaced as minister of the powerful national guard by prince khaled bin ayyaf. the energy minister said many foreign investors who had been have been doing business in saudi arabia for decades  will tell you that they have not seen corruption in their interactions with the saudi government or with the saudi entities .  it (the crackdown) has no impact on foreign direct investment. it has no impact whatsoever on the kingdom s openness, capital flows and our wide open investment environment,  he added. saudi arabia s plan to float around 5 percent of aramco in an initial public offering (ipo) is a centerpiece of vision 2030, a wide ranging reform plan to diversify the saudi economy beyond oil. falih said a decision is yet to be made on where the listing would be made.  on the upcoming meeting of the organization of the petroleum exporting countries in vienna at the end of the month to decide the fate of a global oil production cut, falih said an extension beyond the march 2018 expiry was needed to rebalance the oil market. opec and ten other oil producers led by russia agreed last year to curb production by some 1.8 million barrels per day to get rid of an oversupply in the market.

" the u.s. senate on friday backed a plan to name a plaza in front of the chinese embassy for a pro democracy dissident after what congressional sources called a tit for tat deal that led senator ted cruz to stop blocking president barack obama’s diplomatic nominations. by unanimous voice vote, the senate approved a bill introduced by cruz, a leading contender for the 2016 republican presidential nomination, to name the plaza in washington after liu xiaobo, a nobel peace prize winner. “it’s provocative and counterproductive. we strongly urge the u.s. side to stop such actions,” chinese embassy spokesman zhu haiquan said in an emailed statement. cruz spokesman phil novack said the senator had ended his holds on nominees including obama’s new ambassadors to norway and sweden and two top state department officials. the senate also confirmed those nominations on friday. senate rules allow any member to block a nomination by a procedure known as a “hold.” cruz had imposed the holds last year after washington and other world powers reached a deal with iran in which it agreed to curb its nuclear program in exchange for sanctions relief. novack said cruz lifted his holds because he had successfully drawn attention to what he considers deep problems with the nuclear pact. he declined comment on whether there was an agreement over the plaza bill. “i am not going to comment or say anything about process,” novack said. several senate sources, including high level republicans and democrats knowledgeable about the process, said cruz had dropped the holds after obama’s fellow democrats said they would not oppose the plaza naming measure. novack said the issues “go hand in hand” in that china and iran are both criticized for rights violations. a white house spokesman said obama’s senior advisers would recommend that he veto the bill, adding: “while we continue to impress upon china the imperative of respecting human rights and releasing liu xiaobo, as well as other political prisoners, we do not believe senator cruz’s ploy to rename a street in washington, dc is an effective way to achieve either goal.” the nominees held by cruz and confirmed friday included brian egan to be state’s legal advisor, thomas shannon as under secretary of state for political affairs, azita raji to be ambassador to sweden, samuel heins to be ambassador to norway, john estrada to be ambassador to trinidad and tobago and david mckean as ambassador to luxembourg.

" disgraced former u.s. representative anthony weiner has checked into a rehab facility that treats sex addiction, the dailymail.com reported on wednesday. the online version of the british newspaper said electronic devices are banned at the facility, which separates men from women and treats a range of addictions related to cyber sex, exhibitionism and anonymous sex and other acts. the facility was not named in the report. reuters could not independently verify the report. weiner could not be reached for comment. federal prosecutors and new york police announced last month they were investigating weiner following a separate report by the dailymail.com that he engaged in sexually explicit cellphone and online messages with a 15 year old girl from north carolina. weiner, 52, did not respond at the time to reuters’ requests for comment on the texting report but told the associated press last month that he had “likely been the subject of a hoax.” an investigation into those messages also triggered a new fbi probe of democratic presidential candidate hillary clinton’s emails, as some of her emails were found on a device related to the weiner investigation, sources close to the matter said. once a popular congressman, weiner resigned in 2011 after saying he had accidentally sent a lewd picture over twitter. two years later, his campaign for new york city mayor was derailed after explicit photos he had sent under the pseudonym “carlos danger” to a young woman in indiana surfaced. weiner’s wife, huma abedin, one of clinton’s top aides, said in august she was separating from her husband after yet another scandal. abedin’s announcement followed a new york post report that weiner had recently sent photos of his boxer brief clad genitals – one while he was in bed with their toddler son – via twitter to another woman. an attorney for abedin could not be reached on wednesday to comment on the dailymail.com report.

" taiwan hopes to find a  natural way  to exchange views with chinese president xi jinping at a summit of asia pacific leaders that starts in vietnam this week, the self ruled island s envoy to the meeting said on monday. relations between beijing and taipei have nosedived since president tsai ing wen was elected last year. china believes she wants formal independence for taiwan, a red line for beijing. for her part, tsai says she wants to maintain peace with china but will defend taiwan s democracy and security. china regards taiwan as its sovereign territory. china has suspended a regular dialogue mechanism with taiwan, stepped up military drills around the island and boosted diplomatic pressure by siphoning off its remaining diplomatic allies. speaking to reporters before leaving for vietnam, taiwan s apec envoy james soong said tsai had both pointed out to him and said publicly that taiwan was willing to engage with china.  moreover, we also need to say that both sides of the taiwan strait should have some constructive dialogue,  soong said.   president tsai has clearly said to us to use a natural way with xi jinping at this apec meeting to have the opportunity to exchange views,  he added, without elaborating on how the two might meet. at the last apec summit in the peruvian capital of lima, xi and soong chatted briefly on the sidelines, but had no formal bilateral meeting. the china born soong heads the china friendly people first party, has met xi twice before and has visited china. he referred to his past meetings with xi and also tsai s recent reiteration that peace and sincerity should mark engagement by both sides.  i will have the opportunity to express this view again to the other side,  soong said. china has not said if xi plans to meet soong. asked last week about the possibility of a xi soong meeting, chinese vice foreign minister li baodong would say only that china hoped taiwan s  activities  at apec would accord with the grouping s rules and not affect the summit.  despite taiwan s lack of diplomatic recognition from the vast majority of countries, apec allows the island to participate as a separate economic, rather than political, entity. in 2013, xi told taiwan s envoy at an apec summit in indonesia that a political solution for taiwan could not wait forever.

" a cameroonian journalist jailed for over two years for contact with islamist militant group boko haram is set to be freed after a court on thursday shortened his sentence, his lawyer said.  radio france internationale reporter ahmed abba was arrested in july 2015 and sentenced in april this year to 10 years on terrorism charges that rights groups denounced as a sham. authorities said they found evidence on abba s computer of  attacks planned by boko haram, whose islamist insurgency in nigeria, cameroon and neighboring countries has cost the lives of at least 20,000 people since 2009.   abba has denied knowledge of attacks and protested his innocence. the sentence was reduced to two years on thursday when an appeals court dropped the terrorism charges but upheld less serious charges of  non denunciation  of terrorism.   technically, mr. ahmed can be outside today, tomorrow or the day after tomorrow,  given that he has already been in jail for over two years, his lawyer charles tchoungang told reuters. abba s forthcoming release comes amid a crackdown on dissent by president paul biya who is seeking to extend his 35 year rule in elections next year. the government is confronting a growing separatist insurgency in the country s anglophone regions as well as the threat from boko haram.  patrice nganang, a prize winning cameroonian author who lives in new york, was arrested during a visit to cameroon this month for writing a facebook post critical of biya. nganang is being held in jail until court proceedings next month.  rights groups and rfi welcomed thursday s ruling.   this ruling is a victory for ahmed abba who has been detained for more than two years simply for doing his job as a journalist,  said amnesty international researcher ilaria allegrozzi.

" japan will propose changes to its safeguard mechanism on frozen u.s. beef imports that will shorten review periods and allow importers to voluntarily lower import volumes to prevent tariffs from automatically kicking in, two government sources said on thursday. the proposal will be made at the second round of the u.s. japan economic dialogue in washington on oct. 16, but it is uncertain if the u.s. side will go along, said the two sources, who have direct knowledge of the matter. if successful, the proposal could help ward off trade friction with the united states, which is renegotiating free trade agreements with other countries to protect jobs and lower its trade deficit. under current measures, japan automatically imposes higher tariffs if quarterly imports of specific beef products from any country rise more than 17 percent from the previous year. japan hiked tariffs from aug. 1 on imports of frozen beef, popular in beef bowl dishes, from countries including the united states to 50 percent from 38.5 percent. the move followed u.s. president donald trump’s withdraw from the long planned trans pacific partnership trade deal earlier this year. japan says the tariff hike, set to be in place until next march, is a “safeguard” mechanism to protect domestic farmers, but it has prompted some concern in washington. instead of reviewing import data on a quarterly basis, japan will propose shortening this period to every 10 days, the sources said. this will make it easier for companies that import beef to adjust volumes and avoid triggering tariffs, the sources said. however, the plan is far from certain to work because frozen u.s. beef imports could surge next year in april after the current tariff increase expires, one source said. “once the safeguard is triggered, there is a concern that it will repeatedly be triggered in the future,” the source said. the first round of the u.s. japan economic dialogue, which was held in tokyo in april, ended largely without incident. however, there is some concern among japanese officials that the u.s. side could strongly push for trade concession during the second dialogue meeting. japan had a $69 billion trade surplus with the united states last year, according to the u.s. treasury department, which has expressed concern over what it called the “persistence” of the imbalance. japanese officials counter that tokyo accounts for a much smaller slice of the u.s. deficit than in the past, while china’s imbalance is much bigger.

" the u.s. senate on thursday confirmed former congressman mark green as president donald trump’s choice to lead the u.s. agency for international development at a time the administration is proposing cuts in foreign aid and a reorganization of the agency. green was a republican u.s. representative from wisconsin from 1999 to 2007, ambassador to tanzania under former president george w. bush, and president of the international republican institute, where he sought to promote democracy and governance overseas. his term at the main u.s. aid agency starts amid trump administration plans for a 31 percent cut in the budget of usaid and the state department, a major refugee crisis spilling into europe and the middle east from wars in syria and iraq, and famine and drought in parts of africa that have displaced tens of thousands of people. the agency announced on thursday the second round of funding for more drought stricken countries in africa. green’s appointment has been widely applauded by development experts and aid groups. “green’s confirmation is a sign of hope that if we are entering a period of triage when it comes to many usaid programs, we will at least have a responsible actor overseeing this difficult and fraught process, and hopefully one who will stand firm on behalf of his agency’s critical mission,” said scott morris, a senior fellow at the center for global development and a former u.s. treasury official. abby maxman, president of the oxfam america development group, said green had a long track record in international development that was needed at a time of “unprecedented global crisis from refugees to hunger and climate changes.” ",0

" four years ago, frances broaddus crutchfield, 74, gave $500 to the campaign of virginia’s democratic attorney general mark herring.  this election cycle, the lifelong democrat who lives on a farm in powhatan county, virginia, upped the ante, donating $6,500 so far to herring’s re election bid. “these are desperate times,” she said.  like many democratic state attorneys general, herring has made legal challenges to the agenda of president donald trump a priority. he joined with attorneys general in other states to challenge trump’s executive order banning travel to the united states from six predominately muslim countries and to defend former president barack obama’s clean power plan, which aims to slash carbon emissions.  those fights, and the prospect of others, are drawing record amounts of campaign contributions into attorney general races in a number of states, according to campaign finance records and more than a dozen interviews with attorneys general, challengers, political operatives and donors.  attorneys general, who as the top elected legal officers in each state are charged with defending state agencies from lawsuits as well as initiating litigation on their own, have always helped shape national politics.  but their influence grew during the obama administration, when republican attorneys general regularly sued the administration over immigration and the environment. now, with republicans controlling the white house and congress, democrats are using the same playbook to challenge some of trump’s initiatives in the courts.  donors from both parties have taken notice and are pouring money into upcoming attorneys general campaigns. in his most recent campaign filings, herring reported raising about $2.8 million through the end of june   over three times more than he had at this point during his campaign four years ago.  “what i am seeing is a lot of energy,” herring said.  herring’s republican challenger this november, john adams, has also done well. a corporate defense lawyer who worked in george w. bush’s white house, adams has raised about $1.5 million, roughly 26 percent more at this point than the republican candidate in virginia had in 2013.  “when i first ran in 2012 i would tell people this is one of the most consequential offices, and people would give me a funny look,” said bob ferguson, washington state’s attorney general who successfully sued to block trump’s first travel ban. “i don’t get that look anymore.”  the national fundraising arm for republican attorneys general, raga, announced raising a record $7.4 million in the first six months of 2017, 45 percent more than at this point during the last election cycle in 2015. republican ags have filed legal briefs defending trump’s travel ban and other policies.  “the substantive work we are doing helping the trump administration, but also weighing in on a lot of regulatory issues, is motivating people,” said west virginia attorney general patrick morrisey, raga’s chairman.  meanwhile, the democratic ag’s counterpart, daga, raised about $3.1 million between january and june, daga executive director sean rankin said, 73 percent more than in the first half of 2015.  daga hired full time finance staff for the first time this year, rankin said, and launched its first candidate recruiting program. “four years ago people weren’t moving at this pace,” he said.  to be sure, some donors are motivated by more than simply whether a candidate supports or opposes trump. c. boyden gray, who served as a white house counsel and then ambassador to the european union under two republican presidents, doubled his donation in the virginia ag’s race this year, largely because he thinks adams has the talent to aspire to even higher office.  but gray also said he recognizes the growing stature of attorneys general.  “they’ve upped their game over the last decade,” gray said.  raga decided this year to end a longstanding custom to avoid spending money against democratic incumbents, and daga followed suit. neither committee has yet filed individual donor lists for the first half of 2017; the deadline is monday.  republicans currently hold 29 state ag seats across the country. next year, 32 ag elections are scheduled including the district of columbia.  in wisconsin, republican attorney general brad schimel has raised about $454,000 through the end of june, even though he is not up for reelection until november 2018. in his 2014 campaign schimel had not raised that much until about three months before his election.  a representative for schimel did not return requests for comment.  schimel faces josh kaul, an attorney who has raised about $175,000 since he launched his run in april. kaul’s law firm, perkins coie, served as top election law adviser to hillary clinton’s campaign last year.  kaul’s campaign has already drawn raga’s attention, which funded a web site targeting him. raga has also funded online ads against iowa attorney general tom miller, who is expected to run for reelection next year, and set up a website attacking aaron ford, a democratic state senator in nevada eyeing an ag run in 2018.  in colorado, four democrats are currently vying for the ag nomination. the fundraising leader, phil weiser, served as a technology advisor in the obama white house and has raised about $355,000 through the end of june, almost four times more than the democratic candidate had raised at this point in 2013.  the incumbent, republican cynthia coffman, has disclosed about $40,000 in contributions to her ag committee. however, coffman is also mulling a run for governor, and it is unclear whether donors are awaiting her decision before they write checks.  coffman did not respond to a request for comment.  weiser, who has made fighting trump the centerpiece of his messaging, says democratic donors are making a “sophisticated investment” to confront the administration.  “i’m pushing on an open door,” weiser said.

" u.s. house speaker paul ryan is expected to cruise to re election in his wisconsin congressional district on nov. 8, the day before his real political problems are likely to start. that is when ryan will know the shape of the new house of representatives. if, as some analysts foresee, it becomes even more conservative than it is now, ryan’s difficulties in managing the lower chamber of congress could worsen. for the highest ranking elected u.s. republican, that could spell trouble as the former vice presidential nominee looks ahead to a possible presidential run in 2020. some staunch house conservatives, questioning ryan’s commitment to them and their agenda, are looking less kindly on the idea of re electing him as speaker early next year. but his real test, assuming he retains the speaker’s gavel, would be getting legislative results with a more conservative house. compounding that could be the u.s. senate switching to democratic from republican control and possibly a democratic president, hillary clinton, if she beats republican donald trump in the november election. “next year, almost no matter what, is going to be a very tough one for paul ryan,” said political scientist norman ornstein of the american enterprise institute think tank. the 2016 election results could cast a shadow over ryan’s presidential ambitions in 2020 and 2024, assuming he harbors them. “it may well be that he decides it’s just not worth it, partly given what he sees within his own party,” ornstein said. ryan’s aides were reluctant on monday to discuss the possible challenges of the next congress. “the focus over the next 57 days is defending and strengthening our house majority. we are in a good position,”  said ryan’s political spokesman, zack roday. republicans hold 246 of the 435 house seats, their biggest majority in decades. but analysts expect the party will lose seats in november, especially if trump hurts fellow republicans. house members serve two year terms and most are easily re elected. the political prediction newsletter “sabato’s crystal ball” has tagged only 16 races as too close to call. ten of those are currently held by moderates or pragmatists who have been fairly reliable supporters of legislation backed by republican leaders including ryan. five of the 10 are retiring from the house. if trump’s performance damages candidates down the ticket, moderates may bear the brunt. the result could be a smaller house republican majority more dominated by politically secure conservatives of the sort who have in recent years defied ryan on some legislation. “a shrinking gop conference is no doubt going to be more conservative in the new congress, raising the challenge for speaker ryan to form majorities with a slimmer and more conservative rank and file,” said sarah binder, professor of political science at george washington university. if a number of moderates lose their seats, while most conservatives hold theirs, “then the house freedom caucus becomes more powerful,” said kyle kondik, managing editor of “sabato’s crystal ball.” the freedom caucus is the house’s most conservative bloc, with about 40 members. it helped eject ryan’s predecessor, john boehner, a year ago, leading to ryan’s election as speaker. the freedom caucus initially welcomed ryan, a budget and fiscal policy specialist seen as more willing to listen to their agenda. but some freedom caucus members are unhappy with him since one of their members, representative tim huelskamp of kansas, lost a primary election last month. ryan could have done more to help huelskamp, some critics said. “there was huge disappointment in that,” said representative john fleming, a freedom caucus member from louisiana who is running for the u.s. senate in november. the huelskamp fallout has driven speculation that some conservatives who previously backed ryan will oppose him when the house elects a new speaker in january, although none of them has said so publicly. “i don’t think most members feel yet that ryan is undeserving of more time (as speaker), but frustration with the leadership is certainly growing,” said dan holler of heritage action, the political wing of the heritage foundation conservative think tank.

" advisers to republican presidential nominee donald trump pledged to u.s. agricultural groups that he will give growers and states a say on national farm policy should he be elected, two association leaders said on friday. eleven groups representing farmers, seed companies and other players in the sector met for the first time with trump’s top agricultural advisers in washington on monday to make recommendations on policy, following a similar meeting with representatives of rival democratic nominee hillary clinton in june. the presidential candidates’ agriculture policies are crucial, agricultural groups say, because net u.s. farm income this year is forecast to drop to its lowest since 2002, largely due to a decline in grain prices. if that happens, incomes will be down 56 percent from a recent high of $123.3 billion in 2013. for trump’s team, the meeting came as he has tried to be more disciplined and on message as he seeks to reset his campaign against clinton for the nov. 8 election. he reshuffled top campaign leaders this week, and on friday accepted the resignation of campaign chairman paul manafort. agricultural trade, labor, crop insurance and food safety were among the topics discussed at the meeting with farm groups, which included charles herbster, national chairman of trump’s agricultural advisory committee, and sam clovis, trump’s chief policy advisor, participants told reuters. former nebraska governor dave heineman, who is on trump’s advisory committee, also attended, they said. “there was an assertion that farmers will be at the tables to make decisions, and that was well received by myself and our colleagues,” said barb glenn, chief executive officer of the national association of state departments of agriculture.  also, there was a focus on “the concept that the states need to be brought in to work with the federal government,” she said. clinton’s campaign staff have previously made similar comments to farm groups, said jay vroom, chief executive officer of pesticide association croplife america, who attended meetings with representatives of both candidates. “both of them are quite interested in understanding where american ag is at,” he said. trump on tuesday named 64 people to his agricultural advisory committee, including six u.s. governors, a former u.s. department of agriculture secretary, and the chairmen of the u.s. house and senate agriculture committees. the latest realclearpolitics average of national opinion polls puts clinton 6 percentage points ahead of trump, at 47.2 percent to 41.7 percent.

" the united nations plans to move up to 10,000 illegal migrants from libya next year, a senior u.n. official said on tuesday, in a bid to relieve the plight of thousands stranded in deteriorating conditions in detention centers there. libya is the main departure point for migrants fleeing poverty or war to reach europe by boat as smugglers exploit turmoil gripping the country since the 2011 overthrow of muammar gaddafi. illegal migrant arrivals in italy have fallen by two thirds since july from the same period last year since the u.n. backed government in tripoli, italy s partner, cut back human smuggling at one major hub. italy also helps in the libyan coast guard s operations. but activists say the push has led to worsening of conditions in detention centers, where human rights watch and other groups say migrants face overcrowding, abuse, lack of medical facilities and a shortage of food. the u.n. is repatriating migrants to african countries willing to take them back but it was also in talks with european countries and canada to take in some refugees, roberto mignone, chief mission of the u.n. refugee agency, said.  this week we are going to send out of libya 350 refugees, until the end of january we will send out at least 1000,  he told reuters in an interview.  in 2018 we are planning to send out of libya between 5,000 to 10,000 refugees. we give priority to women, children, elderly, disabled, persons who suffered very seriously.  a total of 44,306 had been registered as refugees and asylum seekers in libya, he said. libyan officials deny abuses and say they are simply overwhelmed by a surge in arrivals amid little funds to accommodate them as public finances have been hit by a loss of oil revenues. the issue of repatriations has got higher attention abroad  since cnn published a video showing what it said was an auction of men offered to libyan buyers as farmhands and sold for $400. in november, libya s u.n. backed government said it was investigating the report and promised to bring the perpetrators to justice. but it has struggled to make an impact as the country is effect controlled by armed factions.

" the israeli military said it attacked a hamas training compound in gaza on monday in response to rocket strikes from the palestinian enclave, which have surged since u.s. president donald trump recognized jerusalem as israel s capital on dec 6. neither side reported any casualties in the overnight shelling exchange, which occurred days before u.s. vice president mike pence visits israel and neighboring egypt, which also borders gaza and is involved in its internal politics. militants in gaza, territory controlled by the hamas islamist group, have launched more than a dozen rockets into southern israel over the last two weeks, the most intensive attacks since a seven week long gaza war in 2014. two rockets were fired late on sunday, one of them exploding inside an israeli border community and the other hitting an open area, the military said. another rocket launched early on monday fell short inside gaza, it said. three structures in a hamas training camp were hit in the israeli counter strike, the military said. hamas usually evacuates such facilities when tensions rise, and israel s choice of the low profile target appeared to signal a desire to avoid more serious confrontation with the group.  israel does not seek escalation,  justice minister ayelet shaked said on army radio. but zeev elkin, another member of prime minister benjamin netanyahu s security cabinet, said in an interview with the radio station that israel s military response would  have to be harshened  if the rocket fire did not stop. israeli officials have blamed the fire on smaller militant groups in gaza and called on hamas to rein them in. should hamas fail to do so, both shaked and elkin said, israel could eventually target the group s leadership for attack.

" german chancellor angela merkel struck a note of caution with respect to french calls for deeper european integration on monday, a day before french president emmanuel macron lays out his plans for ambitious european reforms.  at a news conference after a german election that has forced her to consider a new coalition with the liberal free democrats (fdp), a party critical of macron s ideas on europe, merkel said her conservative cdu/csu bloc would support sensible measures but also wanted to see countries become more competitive.  i m not going to rule out anything or set red lines,  she said when asked how much scope she still had to compromise with paris following the election results.   the union (her conservatives) will support what makes sense. my view is that we can use more europe, but this has to lead to more competitiveness, more jobs and more clout for the european union.  her reserved tone may unsettle macron, 39, who since his own election victory in may has spoken of working with merkel, 63, on a fundamental overhaul of the eu, including the possibility of creating a eurozone budget, a eurozone finance minister and a preemptive fund to help countries in trouble. macron will set out his vision in a speech at the sorbonne university in paris on tuesday. elysee officials said macron would push ahead with the idea of a eurozone budget despite stiff opposition from germany s fiscally conservative fdp. one elysee official said that since a eurozone budget would  be necessary in due course , macron felt it worthwhile to broach the issue, which he hoped would be taken into consideration during germany s coalition negotiations. in berlin, merkel alluded to macron s speech, saying it was important to move beyond  slogans  such as eurozone budget and eurozone finance minister, and to focus on details.  it is not about the slogans but what lies behind them,  she said.  i am talking about this with the french president.  merkel has sent conciliatory signals to macron since his election, when he ran on a pledge to  relaunch  europe together with berlin. but sunday s election result means her room for maneuver is likely to be curtailed, depending on what agreement is reached with her eventual coalition partners. merkel s conservatives remain the biggest bloc in the new bundestag, or lower house, but will end up with fewer seats after suffering a decline in support. she is expected to seek a coalition with the fdp and the greens. such a coalition, unprecedented at the national level, is likely to face opposition in the bundestag when it comes to any major eu reform ideas. the fdp has called for a phasing out of europe s esm bailout fund and changes to eu treaties that would allow countries to leave the euro zone. and the far right, eurosceptic alternative for germany is now the third biggest party in the bundestag, further curbing merkel s room for maneuver. it may take months before a coalition agreement is signed. but once it is, its contours are strict, effectively setting limits on the chancellor s ability to act. merkel said europe would play a role in the coalition negotiations and that it would be important to sound out the fdp. fdp leader christian lindner said he would not agree to any coalition that did not promise a change in the german government s direction.  while that appeared to set the stage for tough talks, he also offered some hope for macron, saying when asked about the french president s eurozone budget ideas that the fdp had a  strong interest  in the strength of france. elysee officials noted that the fdp had reaffirmed its attachment to the eu and strong franco german relations, a point macron was likely to emphasize in his speech. macron, the sources said, would propose that the whole eu move forward together, and that those who did not want to do so should not stand in the way of those that did.

" u.s. president donald trump’s proposed budget estimates that the federal government could save $35 billion over the next decade by rolling back regulations governing wall street. the white house does not detail how those savings, which are equivalent to the annual economic output of the democratic republic of congo, would be realized. but the administration said an ongoing review of existing financial rules “will likely result in proposals that will provide significant savings to the federal government.” while it is not expected to be passed by congress, the fiscal 2018 budget unveiled by the white house on tuesday hews closely to trump’s view that slashing financial regulations  would boost the economy. treasury secretary steven mnuchin is currently conducting a comprehensive review of the impact of the 2010 dodd frank financial reform legislation. an initial report recommending policy changes is expected to come at the beginning of june. the white house’s projected savings from easing financial rules exceed estimates offered by the congressional budget office. that policy scorekeeper calculated that $24 billion would be saved over a decade if a broad dodd frank rollback bill currently in the house of representatives were passed.  most of those savings identified by cbo come from eliminating a dodd frank provision allowing the government to step in and wind down failing financial institutions, and by placing tighter control over the funding of the consumer financial protection bureau (cfpb), which was set up to protect consumers from predatory lending. trump’s budget would give control of funding that agency to congress, a policy change sought by republicans eager to rein it in. currently, the cfpb gets its funding from the federal reserve. the white house estimates that moving oversight of the cfpb to congress would save the federal government $6.8 billion over a decade. however, the budget proposal does not account for any funds appropriated to the cfpb beyond fiscal 2018. the office of financial research, also created by dodd frank to gather data on financial markets, is facing a 28 percent budget cut under the new plan. the commodity futures trading commission and u.s. securities and exchange commission would see their budgets hold steady at $250 million and $1.6 billion, respectively, under the new budget. the cftc is pushing for an additional $31 million in funding in its own budget request.

" at least five african migrants died and more were missing off western libya on monday after a boat carrying about 140 people capsized and then some migrants refused rescue by the libyan coast guard and tried instead to swim to a german rescue vessel. the migrants  rubber boat overturned some 30 miles off the libyan coast, said libyan officials and rescue workers in tripoli to where the coast guard brought some 45 survivors. a video obtained by reuters showed how, during the rescue operation, some migrants tried jumping off the libyan patrol boat which had rescued them to reach a ship of seawatch, a german non governmental organization, a few meters away. some screamed to be allowed to leave the libyan boat as the german vessel came closer. the libyans tried to discourage the migrants from trying to reach the german boat, seawatch said. the incident sparked mutual recrimination by seawatch and the libyan coast guard. at least five migrants had died, including a toddler, due to the  violent and reckless behavior of (the) libyan coast guards,  seawatch said on its twitter feed, adding that 58 had been rescued.  the so called libyan coastguard forced as many as they could into their vessel to take them back to tripoli,  the german group added. the libyan coast guard said an unknown number of people had died after their inflatable boat had sunk and abu ajala amer abdelbari, a coast guard commander, said the german ngo had undermined its rescue operations by approaching its boat.  the seawatch was approaching while we were rescuing migrants,  he said.  this was encouraging the migrants to swim to the seawatch and a (nearby) french navy ship.  the survivors brought to tripoli were from west african countries including nigeria and senegal.  i wanted to reach italy. i don t know what to do now,  said dora onoruyi, a 23 year old arts student from the southern nigerian city of benin known as hub for human traffickers to smuggle women to italy where they often end up as prostitutes.  i see no future in nigeria, there are no jobs,  she said, standing next to a group of weeping nigerian survivors. libya is the main departure point for migrants trying to travel by boat to europe. but numbers crossing to italy have fallen sharply since july due to a drop in people smuggling and increased activity by libya s european backed coastguard.

" donald trump will travel to asia in november for the first time since becoming president, stopping in japan, south korea, china, vietnam and the philippines on a trip expected to be dominated by the north korea nuclear threat. joined by his wife melania, trump will travel nov. 3 14. his visit will include attending two major summits, the asia pacific economic cooperation forum in vietnam and the association of southeast asian nations conclave in the philippines. trump s attendance at the manila summit had been in doubt until recent days, with officials saying he was reluctant to show support for philippine president rodrigo duterte, who has been responsible for a number of anti american outbursts. a u.s. official said asian leaders who met trump at the united nations general assembly in new york last week helped  persuade him to attend in unity with key asian allies. an asian diplomat welcomed trump s decision to visit manila  because that reassures the region that asia policy is not just about north korea, it s about southeast asia as well.  the diplomat said trump s decision to withdraw from the trans pacific partnership trade deal early this year had raised questions about the administration s commitment to the region. but visits by senior officials, including the secretaries of state, defense and commerce, and trump s planned trip, showed washington intended to remain engaged. philippine foreign secretary alan peter cayetano said duterte was looking forward to meeting trump, adding that the relationship between the two countries was so resilient that ties would always recover, regardless of disagreements. trump, who has been locked in an increasingly bitter war of words with north korean leader kim jong un, will have the opportunity to bolster allied resolve for what he calls the  complete denuclearization  of pyongyang. he has denounced kim as a  rocket man  on a suicide mission for test launches of ballistic missiles and for nuclear weapon tests. he has warned north korea would face total devastation if it threatens the united states. kim has blasted trump as  mentally deranged.   the president s engagements will strengthen the international resolve to confront the north korean threat and ensure the complete, verifiable, and irreversible denuclearization of the korean peninsula,  the white house said in announcing the trip. trump s visit to china will reciprocate a trip to the united states made in april by chinese president xi jinping. trump has applied heavy pressure on china to rein in north korea. while his efforts have had limited success thus far, he went out of his way to thank xi on tuesday for his efforts.  i applaud china for breaking off all banking relationships with north korea   something that people would have thought unthinkable even two months ago. i want to thank president xi,  trump said at a news conference with spanish prime minister mariano rajoy. speaking in beijing, u.s. secretary of state rex tillerson told china s top diplomat state councilor yang jiechi that the two presidents had established a  very regular and close working relationship . yang described trump s visit as of great importance to the bilateral relationship.  let us concentrate on cooperation and properly manage our differences in a spirit of mutual respect and mutual benefit,  he said to tillerson. at the same time, trump s national security team is conducting a broad review of u.s. strategy toward china in search of ways to counter chinese trade practices and open up market access, a senior administration official said. the united states also considers chinese entities behind the theft of intellectual property and cyber attacks and wants to find ways to address these concerns, the official said. there was no definite timetable for concluding the review.  we re looking at all of it,  the official said.

" the philippines has suspended trade relations with north korea to comply with a u.n. security council resolution over its repeated missile tests, manila s foreign minister said on friday. the united states and other western countries have asked the united nations to consider tough new sanctions on north korea after its test last week that it said was of an advanced hydrogen bomb.  we can say we have suspended trade relations with north korea,  foreign minister alan peter cayetano told reporters after a meeting with the u.s. ambassador on cooperation on an anti drugs program.  we will fully comply with unsc resolution including the economic sanctions.  tension on the korean peninsula has escalated as north korea s young leader, kim jong un, has stepped up the development of weapons in defiance of u.n. sanctions.  it has tested a series of missiles this year, including one that flew over japan, and conducted its sixth and biggest nuclear test on sunday.  the philippines is north korea s fifth largest trade partner, with bilateral trade from january to june this year worth $28.8 million, according to the state run korea trade investment promotion agency. on an annual basis, north korea imported $28.8 million of products from the philippines in 2016, an increase of 80 percent from the previous year, while manila s imports from pyongyang surged 170 percent to $16.1 million.  according to the philippine department of trade and industry (dti), the main exports to north korea in 2015 were computers, integrated circuited boards, bananas and women s undergarments.  the u.n. security council is quite clear,  cayetano said.  part of these are the economic sanctions and the philippines will comply. we have been communicating with the dti secretary and i think it was yesterday and the other day, we have gotten direction from the (presidential) palace to support the u.n. security council.  cayetano said the trade ban covered raw computer chips from the philippines.

" the leader of togo s main opposition alliance said on friday that president faure gnassingbe must quit power immediately or protests against his family s 50 year ruling dynasty would continue. thousands of people have taken to the streets in the past three days to demand that gnassingbe step aside, in the most serious challenge to his family s stranglehold on power since the death of his father in 2005. police used tear gas to disperse protesters who were burning tires in lome s opposition stronghold of be on friday, a reuters correspondent said.   he has to leave now. we will not accept him staying on any longer,  jean pierre fabre, head of the national alliance for change, told reuters by telephone.   the togolese are tired ... we will continue to protest.  it was not immediately possible to reach gnassingbe s office. text messages and phone calls were restricted and the internet has suffered outages. a short government statement on state tv merely acknowledged the protests and said that 10 people had been injured in them, of which eight were security forces and two protesters.  but unrest was less widespread than in previous days and traffic had resumed in some areas of the seaside capital amid a heavy police and paramilitary presence. by evening there were no further reports of protests, which seemed to have died down, a reuters witness said. the president s father gnassingbe eyadema seized power in a coup in 1967 and ruled for 38 years before his death.  in response to protests, he introduced a 1992 constitution that brought in notional multi party democracy and limited presidential terms to two. ten years later, lawmakers scrapped the term limit so eyadema could run for another term.  when he died in 2005, the military installed his son instead of the national assembly head as was legally required, triggering protests in which at least 500 people were killed. fabre, a french educated former economics lecturer and newspaper editor, lost to gnassingbe in disputed presidential polls in 2010 and 2015. he told reuters that another election would not be fair unless major reforms were made. gnassingbe s government this week sought to appease its opponents by tabling a draft bill to reform the constitution and reintroduce a two term limit, but opposition leaders reject it because it could still enable gnassingbe to rule until 2030. the president, who has encouraged investment to try to turn his tiny nation into a business, banking and shipping hub modeled on singapore or dubai, has a mandate due to expire in 2020. but fabre said even that was too late for him to leave.  we can t accept that. this is a question of liberty,  he said.  the resistance is now organizing itself ... we are very numerous.  the u.n. special representative for west africa and the sahel mohamed ibn chambas urged togo to respond to people s  legitimate expectations . he also called on all parties  to preserve peace and security . chambas, who met with gnassingbe on thursday, has delayed his departure and is staying in togo for further discussions, his spokesman said.   i remain convinced that all parties want to move forward on the reforms ... in order to reach a consensus to respond to the legitimate expectations of the togolese people,  chambas said in a statement. since gambian autocrat yahya jammeh was forced out after losing an election last december, west african countries have become unanimous in accepting two terms as the limit on presidential office   the only exception being togo. security forces appear to have avoided bloodshed so far this week, but amnesty international condemned security forces for firing tear gas at and beating peaceful protesters, and for an  unjustified attack on internet freedom.

" the u.s. senate on thursday gave final legislative approval to a $1.2 trillion spending bill to keep the government open through september, a measure president donald trump is expected to sign before friday’s deadline.      senators from both republican and democratic parties voted in favor of the bill, which passed 79 to 18 with only republicans opposing the measure, citing minimal changes to spending levels.   the bill, which was passed 309 118 in the republican controlled u.s. house of representatives on wednesday, now heads to trump.  while it failed to include many of the items trump had requested, he is expected to sign the bill before midnight friday, when without his signature the government would shut down.  as soon as this spending measure is law, lawmakers and trump must already begin looking forward to the next deadline on oct. 1. lawmakers are hopeful they can pass regular spending bills but the process is likely to be complicated by republican efforts to repeal obamacare, a desire to rewrite the tax code and a need to find a deal to raise the debt ceiling since the limit is expected to be reached in the fall.  under the compromise measure, the pentagon’s funding increased, a priority that had been laid out by republicans and trump. it also funded democratic priorities, including health care subsidies.  “this bill is far from perfect, but it’s better than how we are spending our money today, better than how we were spending our money a year ago,” republican senator roy blunt said on the senate floor.  democrats also claimed victory in the passage of the legislation, arguing that it fails to fund trump’s priorities including money to build a wall along the u.s. mexico border. additionally, the bill funds subsidies for health care coverage provided through the affordable care act, former democratic president barack obama’s signature domestic legislation.  republican senator ted cruz gave his reasons for voting against the bill.  “while i am pleased to see increased funding for our men and women in uniform and their critical missions across the globe, this bill fails in a number of ways, including by continuing to fund sanctuary cities, planned parenthood, and obamacare,” cruz said.  sanctuary cities are those that give limited cooperation to the federal government in enforcing immigration laws and planned parenthood is a conservative target because abortion is among the women’s health care services it provides. the spending bill does not include many of the spending cuts on domestic programs trump had sought and adds $2 billion for the national institutes of health, $295 million for puerto rico’s underfunded medicaid healthcare for the poor and $407 million for firefighting in western states. the legislation adds $12.5 billion in defense spending. it makes $2.5 billion more available after trump gives details on his plans for fighting the islamic state militant group. the bill was approved months after the oct. 1 2016 deadline to pass government funding for the fiscal year. for the past seven months, federal agencies have been operating mainly on simple extensions of the previous year’s funding and the priorities that came with that.

" president barack obama has held preliminary discussions with his team about whom to nominate to the supreme court, the white house said on monday, while accusing senate republicans of “bluster” for saying they would not confirm his pick. white house spokesman eric schultz told reporters administration officials had started talking with senate offices about the process, which is shaping up to be an epic fight between republicans and democrats in a presidential election year. republicans, who control the senate, say obama should put off naming a replacement for conservative justice antonin scalia, who died over the weekend, and leave it to the next president to decide. democrats say it is the president’s responsibility and right to make the choice. americans will choose a new president in the nov. 8 elections. obama leaves office in january 2017. scalia’s death leaves the court evenly divided between liberal and conservative justices just as it is set to decide major cases on abortion, voting rights and immigration. a growing number of republican senators have already said they will not support an obama nominee, including a dozen who are up for reelection in november. on monday, pat toomey of pennsylvania and rob portman of ohio each announced their opposition. both are up for reelection this year. “this is not the first time that republicans have come out with a lot of bluster, only to have reality ultimately sink in,” schultz said, citing recent spats over raising the u.s. debt limit and approving a nuclear deal with iran. “at each pass, they took a hard line. they tried to play politics. but ultimately, they were not able to back up their threats,” schultz said. republicans shrugged off the criticism, pointing to past political battles over supreme court nominees. in 2006, democratic leaders in the senate, as well as then senator obama, tried but failed to block president george w. bush’s nomination of samuel alito to the supreme court, noted don stewart, a spokesman for senate republican majority leader mitch mcconnell. “memories tend to be short around here sometimes,” he said. obama, in california for a long planned summit with southeast asian leaders, will return to washington on tuesday after a press conference at which he is sure to face questions about his strategy for filling the supreme court vacancy. david axelrod, a former adviser to the president, said the  white house should not make an “overtly political” pick while republicans were behaving in a such a political manner themselves.  “to me, it makes sense to nominate one of the stellar judges he’s already chosen who has been approved by this same senate that now refuses to act,” axelrod said. one possible contender is sri srinivasan, who republican senators supported in 2013 when he was confirmed to the u.s. court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit. schultz declined to speculate on names or strategy.  obama will look for a nominee with “impeccable credentials” who believes in adherence to precedent and bringing one’s own ethics and moral bearings to decisions on the court in which the law is not clear, he said. “the president seeks judges who understand that justice is not about some abstract legal theory, or a footnote in a casebook, but it is also about how our laws affect the daily realities of peoples’ lives,” schultz said. leaving the vacancy unfilled could affect the court both this year and next, schultz said, calling on the senate to act. “the constitution does not include exemptions for election years or for the president’s last term in office. there’s no exemptions for when a vacancy could tip the balance of the court,” he said.

" north korea on tuesday rejected a u.n. security council resolution imposing tougher sanctions and said the united states would soon face the  greatest pain  it had ever experienced. the security council unanimously stepped up sanctions against north korea on monday over the country s sixth and most powerful nuclear test, imposing a ban on its textile exports and capping imports of crude oil.  my delegation condemns in the strongest terms and categorically rejects the latest illegal and unlawful u.n. security council resolution,  pyongyang s ambassador, han tae song, told the u.n. sponsored conference on disarmament in geneva. han accused the u.s. administration of being  fired up for political, economic, and military confrontation,  and of being   obsessed with the wild game of reversing the dprk s development of nuclear force which has already reached the completion phase . north korea was condemned globally for its latest nuclear test on sept. 3, which it said was of an advanced hydrogen bomb. the democratic people s republic of korea (dprk) is  ready to use a form of ultimate means , han said without elaborating.  the forthcoming measures by dprk will make the u.s. suffer the greatest pain it ever experienced in its history,  he said. u.s. disarmament ambassador robert wood took the floor to say that the security council resolution  frankly sent a very clear and unambiguous message to the regime that the international community is tired, is no longer willing to put up provocative behavior from this regime .  my hope is the regime will hear the message loud and clear and it will choose a different path,  wood said.  we call on all countries to vigorously implement these new sanctions and all other existing sanctions,  he added.

" the kremlin said on monday it was too early to comment on a proposal by u.s. president elect donald trump to do a deal with moscow on nuclear arms cuts in exchange for washington lifting sanctions imposed on moscow over the ukraine crisis. trump told the times of london in an interview published online on sunday that he would propose offering to end sanctions imposed on russia for its annexation of crimea in return for a nuclear arms reduction deal with russian president vladimir putin. kremlin spokesman dmitry peskov, in a conference call with reporters, said russia would wait until trump took office before commenting on any proposed deals. there were currently no talks on possible nuclear arms cuts with the united states and russia did not intend to raise the sanctions issue itself in negotiations with foreign countries, said peskov. he also dismissed media reports of a planned meeting between putin and trump. “all these statements about preliminary agreements about a meeting do not correspond to reality,” said peskov.  “right now there are no agreements, drafts or any preparations underway for a meeting because the president and mr trump have not discussed this in any way.” asked if the kremlin agreed with trump’s view that nato is obsolete, something the u.s. president elect repeated in the same interview, peskov pointed out that the kremlin had long been making the same point.

" chinese importers of foreign publications must verify the products are legal, china said on friday, weeks after a british academic publisher which blocked access to hundreds of scholarly articles in the country reposted the material. cambridge university press (cup) said in august that it had removed some 300 papers and book reviews published in the china quarterly journal from its website in china following a request from the chinese government.  it said it had blocked the articles, which covered sensitive topics, including the 1989 tiananmen square democracy protests, the 1960s cultural revolution and tibet, in order to keep its other academic and educational materials available in the country. the move sparked an outcry from academics, who attacked the decision as an affront to academic freedom. cup, the publishing arm of britain s elite cambridge university, later reversed its decision and reposted the articles. china s state council information office, responding by fax two weeks after a reuters request for comment, said that publishers choose for themselves to import materials based on market demand and the law.  all publications imported into china s market must adhere to chinese laws and regulations. publication importers are responsible for checking the content of their imported publications,  it said without elaborating. it did not mention cup. at the time, china s education ministry, foreign ministry, cyberspace administration and state publishing authority all declined to comment. the ruling communist party s efforts to censor news and information have sometimes backfired or left outsiders perplexed. in 2009, software designed to check pornographic and violent images on pcs blocked images of a movie poster for cartoon cat garfield, dishes of flesh colour cooked pork and on one search engine a close up of film star johnny depp s face. but under president xi jinping, beijing has stepped up censorship, tightened controls on the internet and various aspects of civil society, and reasserted party authority over academia and other institutions.

" pennsylvania governor tom wolf, a democrat, said on wednesday that he would veto the latest republican budget as lawmakers continue their months long struggle to set a spending plan. the pennsylvania senate passed a $30 billion supplemental budget for fiscal 2016 on wednesday, and the house is also expected to approve the same bill. “in its current form, i will veto this budget, and i urge republicans in the legislature to stop the partisan games and come back to the table to negotiate a final budget that funds our schools and eliminates the nearly $2 billion deficit,” wolf said in a statement. using the republicans’ own math, he said, the budget creates a deficit that would prompt big cuts to education and social programs and lead to higher property taxes. though wolf introduced a fiscal 2017 budget on feb. 9, the state still has only a partial spending plan for this fiscal year, which began july 1. that makes a full 2016 budget nearly nine months overdue. during the impasse, school districts, colleges and social service agencies have all had to make due without state funding. the partial budget wolf agreed to in december finally sent the first six months of aid flowing to schools, but by then they had gone almost that long without any state money. school districts borrowed a collective $1 billion across the state   incurring up to $50 million in interest and fees   to stay open through december. they are now warning, again, that they could soon have to consider shutting without state funds. the spending plan passed on wednesday by the senate does not raise sales or income taxes but restores most of the $6 billion in funding wolf eliminated in his line item vetoes in december. the bill would provide $5.95 billion for basic education, a $200 million increase from the previous year. it would also restore higher education funds, including for community colleges, the pennsylvania state university and temple university. wolf took office in january 2015 pledging to restore the previous administration’s cuts to education funding. he wanted to pay for it in part with a tax on natural gas extraction, which some republican legislative leaders have opposed.

" republican presidential candidate donald trump told crowds in michigan and minnesota on sunday his administration would not admit refugees without local support, using appearances in states with growing muslim communities to criticize democrat hillary clinton’s support for accepting people fleeing syria. trump said in minneapolis that people there had already seen the results of “faulty” vetting with minnesota’s community of somali muslims. he said what was happening in michigan, home to several cities with muslim communities, was “disgraceful.” trump held rallies in both states as part of his final push toward tuesday’s presidential election, even though michigan and minnesota traditionally support democrats in white house races. “here in michigan, you’ve seen firsthand the problems caused with the refugee program ... it puts your security at risk and it puts enormous pressure on your schools and your community resources,” trump told an outdoor rally in sterling heights. “a trump administration will not admit any refugees without the support of the local community.” muslim american groups have criticized trump for comments such as endorsing police profiling as an anti terrorism tactic. he initially called for a ban on muslims entering the united states, later changing it to bar immigration from what he called “terror prone” regions until extensive vetting measures were in place.   clinton has praised democratic president barack obama’s plan to accept 10,000 syrian refugees in 2016 and said the united states could do more.  trump said her plan to admit refugees from syria would import “generations of terrorism, extremism and radicalism.” his vow to block people fleeing islamic state violence in syria and instead form “safe zones” in the middle east has been a theme of his campaign.  on sunday, trump framed the issue in local terms. what was happening in minnesota was a “disaster,” he told the crowd at a minneapolis airplane hangar.  “some of them, they’re joining isis, they’re spreading their extremist views all over the country,” he said of refugees there, citing a september stabbing attack in st. cloud, minnesota, as justification for his proposals.  somalis began arriving in minnesota in the late 1980s and early 1990s, fleeing a civil war in their horn of africa nation. there are about 39,000 living in the state, according to u.s. census data from 2014. somali americans have expressed concern about how they are perceived after a trial earlier this year where three young men from the community were convicted of trying to join islamic state.

" the president of the central african republic, faustin archange touadera, on tuesday pleaded with the world to not forget his country and urged the u.n. to bolster its peace keeping force amid growing violence that threatens to spin the country out of control. thousands have died and a fifth of central africans have fled a conflict that broke out after mainly muslim seleka rebels ousted president francois bozize in 2013, provoking a backlash from christian anti balaka (anti machete) militias. although unrest has since subsided, fighting has spiked this year and the united nations warned this month that ethnic fighting could descend again into a much larger conflict if combatants are not disarmed.  central africa is at a critical moment in its history. we need the support of our friends; there are risks that we ll be forgotten,  touadera told a news conference ahead of a high level meeting at the u.n. general assembly.  violence has escalated since former colonial power france last year ended its peacekeeping mission in the country, which once had as many as 2,000 soldiers. france has grown concerned by events, although officials say paris is unlikely to return to central africa unless the capital were under threat. the violence continues despite a peace deal signed between the government and rival factions in rome last month and a 13,000 strong u.n. mission (minusca), which will see its mandate renewed in november.  the only force capable of ensuring security is the united nations,  touadera said.  the capacities of minusca in terms of men and equipment have to be strengthened.   national security forces are too weak to tackle a multitude of armed groups and counter the spillover from conflicts in neighboring countries. diplomats have also said that touadera does not have the political strength to impose central government rule. touadera bemoaned the departure of france s operation sangaris, but also the withdrawal of about 2,000 american and uganda forces that were fighting the ugandan rebel group the lord s resistance army and the withdrawal of minusca s congolese battalion in the west.  all of this has created a vacuum that the minusca must fill,  he said.

" fears that a volcano could erupt imminently on the holiday island of bali prompted several countries to issue travel warnings, while indonesian authorities raced to evacuate tens of thousands of people living in the  danger zone . australia, new zealand, singapore, the united states and the u.k. issued advisories on monday and at the weekend warning that increased volcanic activity at mount agung in eastern bali could disrupt flights at one of the world s most popular tourist destinations.     given the possible eruption of mount agung, singaporeans should defer non essential travel to the affected areas at this juncture,  the foreign ministry said in an online statement.      bali s international airport was operating normally on monday, as were tourist spots across the island. indonesian authorities have imposed a 12 km (7.5 miles)exclusion zone around the crater. the national disaster management agency (bnpb) said on monday that around 62,000 people lived within the  danger zone  around the volcano and that they all needed to evacuate, though so far only 50,00 had moved to the temporary shelters provided in neighboring villages.  there are some who are staying behind because the volcano hasn t erupted yet or because of religious beliefs,  said bnpb spokesman sutopo purwo nugroho.   our staff are combing the area and urging everyone to evacuate,  he said, speaking at a news conference in the indonesian capital jakarta. nugroho said mount agung has entered a  critical phase , meaning magma has risen closer to the surface, as indicated by hundreds of shallow volcanic tremors that have rattled the area in recent days.    evacuees are being housed in makeshift shelters like town halls and school gyms. host communities were providing food and water, while the central and local governments were providing tents, blankets and other relief.    officials have urged the public to remain calm amid false reports and videos circulating online of an eruption. indonesia, which sits on the so called pacific ring of fire, has nearly 130 active volcanoes, more than any other country. many indonesians live near volcanoes because lava flows can make the surrounding soil and land fertile for farming.

" the rancorous political debate over sexual identity unexpectedly prompted the republican controlled house of representatives to reject an energy and water spending bill on thursday after democrats attached an amendment to protect the rights of transgender people. the legislation, which would provide funds for the u.s. army corps of engineers and the department of energy in the fiscal year that starts oct. 1, failed on a 112 305 vote, with 130 republicans and 175 democrats opposing the legislation. the outcome was such a surprise that the house appropriations committee initially announced the bill had passed and was forced to retract the statement.  democrats blamed republicans for opposing a democratic amendment to bar federal contractors from government work if they discriminate against the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (lgbt) community. democrats failed to attach the same measure to a separate house spending bill last week. “in turning against a far reaching funding bill simply because it affirms protections for lgbt americans, republicans have once again lain bare the depths of their bigotry,” house democratic leader nancy pelosi said in a statement. but republicans accused democrats of working to sabotage the house appropriations process by voting 6 175 against the bill after they had succeeded in amending it. house speaker paul ryan said his own decision not to keep legislation under tight control had created conditions for “more amendments from both sides of the aisle ... and, yes, more unpredictability.”   “that’s what happened here today. it’s unfortunate, because this is a very good bill,” ryan said. he vowed to continue pushing the energy and water bill, along with other appropriations measures. democrats said they opposed two republican amendments. one would prevent washington from witholding federal funds from north carolina over its law on lgbt bathroom use. the other would have stopped the democrats’ lgbt amendment from affecting religious workplace exemptions. the white house had already threatened to veto the legislation over other provisions that democrats said would undermine the clean water act.

" republican lawmakers in u.s. congress on wednesday rejected two democratic amendments to provide nearly $1 billion in funding for bipartisan legislation intended to combat america’s opioid epidemic, aides said. the rejection, which came during a meeting of u.s. house of representatives and senate negotiators on the measure, could undermine democratic support for final legislation that could come up for a vote in the house of representatives as early as friday. the house and senate each passed its own versions of the legislation in the last few months. house and senate democratic lawmakers are now withholding their support for the final version of the bill, according to two democratic aides. democratic opposition could prove to be an obstacle, especially in the senate, where lawmakers need 60 votes to move legislation forward.  two amendments, from house and senate democrats, would have provided $920 million up front to finance program grants for states. aides said the programs otherwise require completion of a lengthy appropriations process that could stall in a congressional session shortened by this year’s election campaign. republican aides were not immediately available for comment. but house republicans are separately considering a health spending measure that would provide more than $581 million to address opioid abuse. house democratic caucus chairman xavier becerra said on wednesday it was only the latest instance in which legislation with bipartisan backing fell short on funding. “it’s becoming a bit of a joke to say we’re concerned and want to do something, when the only thing we’ll do is shell of what it actually takes,” he said.

" whether they like president donald trump or not, the u.s. veterans who gather at hoa s place in danang show little concern that he avoided the war that marked their lives. trump flies into the vietnamese resort of danang on friday for a summit of asia pacific leaders, landing in a city that for many americans of his generation was their first sight of vietnam   and of war.  he ll finally be able to put on his resume that he was in vietnam,  said david clark, 68, who is originally from akron, ohio and calls trump  a joke . after serving in vietnam from 1968 to 1969 with the marine corps, he has now returned to help with projects to address the legacy of the war. trump never served in the military. he received five deferments during the vietnam war, including one for bone spurs in his heel, the new york times reported last year. the paper quoted trump as saying the bones spurs had been  temporary .      everyone i know tried to avoid it,  said draftee keith soukkala, sipping a beer at hoa s place, a favored bar of veterans near danang s  china beach .  i stayed out as long as i could but i didn t have any bone spurs,  said soukkala, who splits his time between vietnam and alaska and said he voted for trump. at 73, he is two years older than trump and recalls landing in danang to the humid heat and  a certain smell in the air  at the start of a 13 month tour with the marine corps dodging bombs hidden by the communist viet cong guerrillas. the seaside resort of danang has a special place in u.s. vietnamese history: it was here that the first u.s. ground troops disembarked in 1965 in the escalation of a war that would last another decade before the communist victory. close to some of the heaviest fighting in central vietnam, danang had a big u.s. air base. china beach was a relaxation spot for u.s. soldiers back from combat. now, danang s beachfront hotels draw tourists from around the world. gleaming office towers mark it out as one of vietnam s most modern cities and one the communist government sought to showcase with the hosting of the asia pacific economic cooperation (apec) summit which trump will attend. it s also home to a community of u.s. veterans who returned to a country where a recent pew research survey showed the united states was viewed favorably by 84 percent of people. clark came back in 2013 for a year and is still in danang, busy with projects to destroy unexploded u.s. bombs and help families affected by the agent orange defoliant linked to illness and deformity. mark o connor, 67, of sioux falls, south dakota, and once part of a helicopter assault team, visits as often as he can to provide bicycles to children in hill villages.      on this visit, though, he said he had come back in the hope of seeing trump   his support unaffected by the fact the president had not served in vietnam.  you know, more power to him,  he said.  you can t feel bad about him and not feel bad about everyone who went to canada to avoid the draft.

" a federal watchdog said on friday it was reviewing the circumstances surrounding u.s. treasury secretary steven mnuchin’s controversial flight last month to kentucky, where he spoke to business leaders and viewed the solar eclipse. “responding to inquiries received from members of the public, we are reviewing the circumstances of the secretary’s august 21 flight to louisville and ft. knox to determine whether all applicable travel, ethics, and appropriation laws and policies were observed,” rich delmar, counsel to the treasury’s office of inspector general, said in a statement. mnuchin, a former hedge fund manager, and his wife, actress louise linton, traveled on a u.s. government plane to kentucky where they viewed the aug. 21 solar eclipse with senate majority leader mitch mcconnell and others. linton posted a photo of herself on social media getting off the plane and listing the designer brands she was wearing, triggering criticism over the display of wealth and privilege. the washington post, which first reported the review, said democratic senator ron wyden last week requested a “detailed explanation” of the travel and justification for use of the government aircraft. an independent watchdog group, citizens for responsibility and ethics in washington, also had sought records of the trip, saying it seemed to have been planned to enable mnuchin to be at a site that had views of the total eclipse. the eclipse visible in washington only obscured about 80 percent of the sun. the post said treasury secretaries and other cabinet members not involved in national security have traditionally flown on government aircraft on rare occasions, usually taking commercial flights for domestic travel.     treasury officials have said the trip was official government travel, with mnuchin speaking to louisville business leaders before visiting fort knox, where a large portion of the u.s. gold reserves are held. delmar said the office of inspector general was looking into various issues raised by the flight. “when our review is complete, we will advise the appropriate officials, in accordance with the inspector general act and established procedures,” he said in the statement.

" u.s. president donald trump’s commission to investigate possible election fraud on monday put a freeze on its effort to collect sensitive voter data from states in the face of growing legal challenges. in an email, the panel’s designated officer, andrew kossack, asked state elections officers to “hold on submitting any data,” the commission said in court filings.  several state elections officials confirmed receiving a letter from the panel stating that it would provide further instructions after a federal judge had ruled on a complaint filed by a watchdog group, the electronic privacy information center (epic), which is seeking a temporary restraining order. earlier on monday, the american civil liberties union sued the presidential advisory commission on election integrity, alleging violations of federal law requiring transparent government. the bipartisan panel, led by vice president mike pence and kansas secretary of state kris kobach, asked the 50 u.s. states for a host of voter data, including birth dates and the last four digits of voters’ social security numbers.  most u.s. states have rejected full compliance, which many called unnecessary and a violation of privacy.  “this has been a misadventure from the get go,” massachusetts secretary of state william galvin, who had refused to give the commission any data, said by phone. in wisconsin, elections officials halted plans to inform the commission how it could purchase for $12,500 its public voter data, not including social security numbers or birth dates.  “we’re just putting everything on hold,” said reid magney, spokesman for the wisconsin elections commission. arkansas, however, had already sent in a limited batch of publicly available data, according to the office of secretary of state mark martin, in a court document, the government said it would not download the information from arkansas and would instead delete it. representatives for the white house did not immediately respond to a request for comment.         the commission last week said it would meet on july 19 in washington near the white house. on monday, critics cheered the move and expressed hope the commission would permanently abandon efforts to collect voter data. “the commission has effectively conceded,” epic president marc rotenberg said by phone. state officials from both parties and election experts widely agree that voter fraud is rare. civil rights groups called the commission a voter suppression tactic by trump.  the republican president created the panel in may following his claim, without evidence, that millions of people voted illegally in the 2016 election.

" europe must be prepared to respond in kind if the united states’ proposed new sanctions against russia end up hurting its companies, an influential german industry association said on thursday. u.s. lawmakers reached an agreement on wednesday paving the way for the u.s. senate to pass a bill as early as this week to impose the new sanctions on russia and bar president donald trump from easing them without congress’ approval. the european union fears the new u.s. restrictions could be an obstacle to its companies doing business with russia and threaten the bloc’s energy supply lines, but the 28 country bloc is divided over how to respond. the head of the german committee on east european economic relations said potential damage to european energy sector companies with business interests in russia could justify counter sanctions. “it’s the last thing we want, but we must keep the option open,” michael harms told a news conference in berlin. “the sanctions they want against pipeline projects seem designed to boost u.s. energy exports to europe, create u.s. jobs and strengthen u.s. foreign policy.” unlike the united states, whose growing production of shale gas has slashed its reliance on energy imports, much of central europe depends on imports of russian gas through a vast latticework of pipelines. “imposing sanctions that hit a third party, namely europe, and at the same time promoting the american economy with the slogan ‘buy american gas’   that’s pretty striking,” said kurt bock, chief executive of germans chemicals giant basf , which drills for gas in russia. the eu has imposed its own sanctions against russia over its role in the ukraine crisis, and germany has taken a particularly tough stance towards moscow. last week reuters reported that germany was urging brussels to add four more russian nationals and companies to its blacklist over siemens gas turbines delivered to ukraine’s crimea region, annexed by moscow in 2014. german economy minister brigitte zyries complained on thursday that washington had abandoned the “common line” it has maintained with europe over russia. but despite the eu sanctions and europe’s criticism of moscow on other fronts as well as ukraine   including allegations that russian spies are meddling in western elections    russia remains a crucial business partner for germany. on thursday, the committee raised to 20 percent its forecast for growth in german exports to russia in 2017, compared to 10 percent in its previous forecast.

" the new york times endorsed democrat hillary clinton for the white house on saturday, saying she was more qualified than republican presidential rival donald trump to handle the challenges facing the united states. the newspaper described clinton as “one of the most tenacious politicians of her generation” and said she had displayed a command of policy and diplomatic nuance while building a reputation for grit and bipartisan cooperation. “a lifetime’s commitment to solving problems in the real world qualifies hillary clinton for this job, and the country should put her to work,” the times said of the former secretary of state and u.s. senator from new york. clinton will face off against trump on monday night in the first of three presidential debates, with opinion polls showing her once sizable lead over the new york businessman narrowing amid continued public doubts about her trustworthiness. the times said clinton’s mistakes had distorted perceptions of her character, but praised her work restoring u.s. credibility in foreign affairs as secretary of state and on behalf of children, women and families throughout her career. “mrs. clinton has shown herself to be a realist who believes america cannot simply withdraw behind oceans and walls, but must engage confidently in the world to protect its interests and be true to its values,” the newspaper said. it said clinton’s decision to use a private email server for government work as secretary of state deserved the scrutiny it has received in the campaign, but considered alongside the real challenges facing the united states it “looks like a matter for the help desk.” viewed against those challenges, trump “shrinks to his true small screen, reality show proportions,” the times said, promising another editorial on monday explaining “why we believe mr. trump to be the worst nominee put forward by a major party in modern american history.” the endorsement from the times editorial board is no surprise. the last republican the times backed for the white house was president dwight eisenhower in 1956. but several newspapers with more conservative editorial boards, including the dallas morning news and cincinnati enquirer, also have recently endorsed clinton. the times said clinton’s best argument for the white house was her ability to rise to the challenges facing the country. “the 2016 campaign has brought to the surface the despair and rage of poor and middle class americans” facing the burdens of recession, technological change, foreign competition and war, it said. “over 40 years in public life, hillary clinton has studied these forces and weighed responses to these problems. our endorsement is rooted in respect for her intellect, experience, toughness and courage over a career of almost continuous public service, often as the first or only woman in the arena,” the newspaper said.

" democratic senator ron wyden thinks republican leadership is moving away from trying to implement full scale tax reform this year and instead are turning their attention to simply cutting rates.  “if you look at the language of mitch mcconnell in the last couple of days, he’s talking about tax cuts, he’s been saying, ‘well, i don’t know about tax reform, let’s have a tax cut,’” wyden, the top democrat on the senate finance committee, said in an interview with reuters on friday.  “to me that would really be, again, contrary to what the president campaigned on,” he said. mcconnell is the senate majority leader.  sweeping tax reform had been high on the republican legislative agenda. but so far, house of representatives and the senate, both controlled by republicans, have been unable to find consensus on a tax package that could pass both chambers and be signed into law by president donald trump.  wyden argued there is robust bipartisan agreement that a tax overhaul is needed.  “there are plenty of republicans in congress   because they talk to me   who would really like to do major tax reform,” he said.      last month, the white house weighed in on the tax discussion, offering only a one page plan that included deep cuts in rates, many for businesses, but stopped well short of legislative language or providing detail on specific changes. “the tax reform proposal is shorter than drug store receipts i have,” wyden remarked.  several lawmakers have warned that if tax reform is not completed by the end of 2017, it will become more difficult to pass in 2018, when congressional midterm elections will be held. the house has begun holding hearings and has developed a “blue print”   including a controversial border adjustment tax proposal that would tax imports while providing credit for exports.  wyden, in an echo of other senators, including republicans, said that a border adjustment tax would be unlikely to fare well in the senate   going so far to call it a “grocery tax” that would unfairly hit consumers in the middle class.

" while one focus of the leak crackdown announced on friday by u.s. attorney general jeff sessions is on journalists who receive leaked information, another is on suspected leakers. republican president donald trump has complained for months about leaks to the news media, but his democratic predecessor, barack obama, also took a hard line on leaking.  eight of the 12 cases where federal prosecutors charged individuals with violating the espionage act, a world war one era law aimed at keeping sensitive information out of the hands of the united states’ enemies, were brought under obama. here are the 12 cases, dating back 46 years. daniel ellsberg became the first such case in 1971 when prosecutors accused the national security analyst and his colleague, anthony russo, of providing what would become known as the pentagon papers to the new york times and other media outlets. the secret documents revealed the extent of u.s. involvement in vietnam. charges against the two men were dismissed when a judge found that the government had wiretapped ellsberg, possibly illegally. samuel morison, a former navy intelligence analyst, was charged in 1984 with illegally passing secret photographs of soviet ships to a magazine, jane’s defence weekly. he pleaded not guilty, but a jury convicted him, making him the first person convicted under the espionage act for divulging secrets to the press. he was sentenced to two years in prison but paroled. president bill clinton pardoned him. lawrence franklin, a defense department employee, was charged in 2005 with passing classified information about iran to two pro israel lobbyists, steven rosen and keith weissman. franklin pleaded guilty and received a 12 year sentence. eventually, after the government’s case against rosen and weissman collapsed, a judge reduced franklin’s sentence to 10 months in a halfway house. shamai leibowitz was an fbi translator when material that he heard while translating ended up on a blog. he reached an agreement with prosecutors before he was charged, and pleaded guilty in 2009 to one count of disclosing classified information. he was sentenced to 20 months in prison. former national security agency official thomas drake was suspected in 2010 of revealing information about the agency’s warrantless wiretapping program. he was indicted under the espionage act but said the only information he leaked was about waste in an nsa program, which he gave to the baltimore sun. the 10 felony counts were dropped when he pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor and received no prison time. chelsea manning, an army private first class formerly known as bradley manning, turned over more than 700,000 classified files to the anti secrecy website wikileaks in the biggest breach of secret data in u.s. history. manning was found guilty of 19 counts but acquitted of the most serious one, aiding the enemy. she was sentenced in august 2013 to 35 years in a military prison but was released in may after obama, in his last days in office, commuted the final 28 years of manning’s sentence.  stephen kim, a u.s. state department contract analyst, allegedly divulged to a fox news reporter what u.s. intelligence believed about how north korea would respond to new sanctions. a grand jury indicted him in 2010 for disclosing defense information and making false statements. he pleaded guilty in 2014 and was sentenced to thirteen months in prison. he was released in may 2015.  former cia officer jeffrey sterling was charged in 2011 with illegally disclosing classified information about iran to james risen, a new york times reporter, for his book “state of war.” a jury convicted sterling in 2015. a judge sentenced him to 42 months in prison.  former cia officer john kiriakou was charged in 2012 with divulging to journalists secret information about the cia’s interrogation program, including the identity of a covert officer. in an agreement with prosecutors, he pleaded guilty to one count and was sentenced to two and a half years in prison. he was released in february 2015 on condition that he serve three months of house arrest. u.s. officials said in june 2013 they had filed sealed criminal charges against former nsa contractor edward snowden for unauthorized leaks and theft of government property. snowden prompted a worldwide debate after he gave documents to newspapers showing the extent of u.s. surveillance programs. russia granted him asylum. former fbi bomb analyst donald sachtleben agreed in september 2013 to plead guilty to disclosing national defense information for telling an associated press reporter details of a failed airline bombing attempt by yemen based al qaeda in the arabian peninsula. a judge sentenced sachtleben that year to a 43 month prison term for the national security offenses and a consecutive 97 month term for unrelated child pornography charges. the justice department charged u.s. intelligence contractor reality leigh winner with violating the espionage act for leaking a classified report on russian interference in u.s. elections to the intercept. the nsa report described russian efforts to launch cyber attacks on at least one u.s. voting software supplier and send “spear phishing” emails to more than 100 local officials days before the nov. 8, 2016 election.

" the bodies of seven migrants were discovered on wednesday in a boat adrift off libya while around 900 people were saved in operations in the southern mediterranean, italy s coastguard said. it was one of the most intense days of rescues recorded in the area in recent months and follows a sharp fall off in the number of migrants reaching italy. a coastguard spokesman said the seven bodies were picked up by a boat under the command of a european union naval force operating in the mediterranean. he had no further information about who they were or how they had died. about 900 migrants were rescued in eight different missions, the spokesman said, adding that he expected they would be brought to italy later in the week. migrant arrivals in italy fell 30 percent in the first eight months of the year, the interior ministry said this week, thanks mainly to a sharp decline since july when italy struck a deal with libya to block would be asylum seekers from setting sail. as part of the deal, the libyan coastguard has played a much more active role in preventing crossings. earlier this week, it intercepted 299 migrants from sub saharan african countries on two rubber boats east of tripoli, officials said. libya s western shoreline is the main departure point for migrants trying to reach europe by boat, many of them fleeing conflict or poverty.  the interior ministry said on tuesday that between january and october, 111,397 migrants had reached italy by boat against 159,427 in the same period in 2016. the international organization for migration (iom) says that so far this year at least 2,630 people have died at sea trying to cross to italy.

" australia on tuesday launched a postal vote on whether to legalize same sex marriage as a widely watched poll indicated the country would be overwhelmingly in support. the non compulsory ballot, which runs until the end of october, will determine whether australia becomes the 25th country to legalize same sex marriage, while also healing a rift in the government. despite securing 70 percent public support in an ipsos/fairfax poll on tuesday, the issue of same sex marriage had faced a political deadlock, only broken last week when the high court gave the all clear for the vote. the poll illustrates why parliament should simply vote to approve same sex marriage without holding the national ballot, opposition labor leader bill shorten said.     change in this country only ever happens when people participate in the change,  shorten told reporters in canberra.  please don t leave this change to other people.   the ballot of nearly 16 million people at a cost a$122 million ($97.86 million) will help prime minister malcolm turnbull unite his liberal national coalition, which had been fractured over the issue throughout his two year tenure. turnbull had been under pressure to resolve the impasse after two previous efforts to hold a compulsory vote were rejected by the senate, where the government is in the minority. frustrated progressive members said they would side with the opposition labor party to secure same sex marriage if the pm could not finally resolve the issue, though some conservative lawmakers threatened to resign if turnbull did not stick to a public vote, threatening the pm s one seat majority. the impasse was eventually resolved when the high court ruled the government could proceed with the non compulsory vote, without senate approval. for a graphic on where same sex marriage is legal, click: here ",0

" republican presidential candidates ted cruz and marco rubio praised iran’s release of five detained americans on sunday, but sharply criticized the deal the white house made to win their freedom saying it would lead to more americans being taken “hostage.” u.s. president barack obama pardoned three iranian americans charged for violating sanctions against iran, a lawyer for one of the men said, while prosecutors moved to drop charges against four iranians outside the united states. iran agreed to free five americans including rezaian and saeed abedini, an iranian american christian pastor sentenced to eight years in prison in 2013 on charges of undermining iran’s national security.          cruz, speaking to fox news sunday, said, “praise god that the prisoners are coming home” but iran got the better end of the prisoner swap. “we released seven terrorists who had helped iran with their nuclear program, and we agreed not to prosecute another 14 terrorists for doing the same thing. that’s 21 terrorists helping iran develop nuclear weapons that they intend to use to try to murder us,” cruz said. he said the deal was a “very dangerous precedent.” obama on sunday defended the move describing the release as a “reciprocal, humanitarian gesture” that was a one time event.     but rubio, speaking on nbc’s meet the press, said the deal traded american “hostages” for iranian “prisoners who did commit a crime”. obama has “put price on the head of every american abroad,” rubio said. “our enemies now know that if you can capture an american, you can get something meaningful in exchange for it.” rubio said that the deal shows “weakness” on the part of washington, and if he were elected president, iran would not dare to detain americans because it would face tough consequences. he said the start of his presidency would be like that of ronald reagan in 1981, when iran released hostages taken at the american embassy in tehran in 1979. a senior obama administration official pushed back against criticism of the prisoner swap, saying that those held in the united states were not a major threat, and the administration made a “judgment” that brought detained americans home. “if people want to say that they were for leaving these americans in prison, they should say so. but the fact of the matter is this was our opportunity to bring them home,” the official told reporters on a conference call.

" u.s. president donald trump warned on tuesday he might terminate the nafta trade treaty with mexico and canada after three way talks failed to bridge deep differences. the united states, canada and mexico wrapped up their first round of talks on sunday to revamp the trade pact with little sign of a breakthrough coming. trump reopened negotiations of the 1994 treaty out of concern u.s. economic interests were suffering. “personally, i don’t think we can make a deal. i think we’ll probably end up terminating nafta at some point,” trump said at a political rally in phoenix, arizona. suggesting a termination might help jumpstart the negotiations, trump said: “i personally don’t think you can make a deal without a termination.” following trump’s remarks, mexican foreign minister luis videgaray tweeted: “no surprises: we’re already in a negotiation. mexico will remain at the table with serenity, firmness and with the national interest ahead.” in a joint statement issued at the end of five days of negotiations in washington, the top trade officials from the three countries said mexico would host the next round of talks from sept. 1 to 5. the talks will move to canada later in september, then return to the united states in october, with additional rounds planned for later this year.

" ariana grande returned to the united states on tuesday, one day after a suicide bomber killed 22 people at the singer’s concert in manchester, england, as questions lingered over whether she would continue her european tour. grande, 23, was seen in photographs posted on the daily mail website walking down the steps of a private plane at an airport in her hometown of boca raton, florida, and being met by family members. the daily mail images showed the diminutive pop star dressed casually in sweats and appearing downcast as she greeted her boyfriend, the rapper mac miller, on the tarmac and getting into a waiting car. grande had not been seen publicly since an explosion ripped through the packed manchester arena at the end of her performance there. some of the 22 people who died in the attack were teens or young girls. grande was apparently unharmed. british police have identified the man suspected of carrying out the massacre as 22 year old salman abedi, who was born in manchester to parents of libyan origin. islamic state claimed responsibility for what it called revenge against “crusaders,” but there appeared to be contradictions in its account of the operation. in her only statement so far, grande took to twitter some five hours after the bombing to describe herself as “broken” in the aftermath of the attack. “from the bottom of my heart, i am so so sorry. i don’t have words,” she said in the tweet. grande was performing in manchester during the european leg of a tour to promote her third album, “dangerous woman,” which  also has her scheduled to visit london, belgium, poland, germany, switzerland and france in the coming weeks. despite speculation that she would cancel the rest of the tour, no formal announcement had been made as of tuesday.  grande’s manager, scooter braun, did not respond to requests for comment by reuters. “we mourn the lives of children and loved ones taken by this cowardly act,” braun said in a statement posted on twitter on monday evening. “we ask all of you to hold the victims, their families and all those affected in your hearts and prayers.” grande, a native of boca raton, starred in the broadway musical “13” and on the nickelodeon tv series “victorious” before releasing her solo debut album, “yours truly.”  best known for her singles “problem” and “break free,” grande is credited with having an exceptionally broad vocal range for a pop star.

" internet giants, including alphabet’s google (googl.o) and facebook (fb.o), are moving to compromise on several major policy issues as they adjust to an abrupt shift in the political winds in washington.  just last week, the u.s. senate took a big step toward advancing legislation that would partially strip away the internet industry’s bedrock legal protection, a 1996 law that shields companies from liability for the activities of their users. at the same time, democratic senators are writing legislation that would create new disclosure rules for online political ads after facebook this month revealed that suspected russian trolls purchased more than $100,000 worth of divisive ads on its platform during the 2016 election cycle. the u.s. federal election commission is considering bringing in facebook and other tech firms for a public hearing. unlike in europe, where they have faced a bevy of new rules and billion dollar fines, internet giants have avoided virtually all types of government regulation in the united states, even as their market power continues to grow. amazon (amzn.o), for example, controls more than a third of u.s. online commerce, while google and facebook combined account for more than sixty percent of the u.s. digital ad market. internet firms have from their inception urged u.s. politicians in both parties to treat their industry as a nascent sector in need of unique protections. these firms enjoyed an especially close relationship with the democratic administration of former president barack obama, which saw several officials go to work for google upon leaving the white house. but some democrats, still bitter over russia’s alleged meddling in the 2016 election, are now expressing alarm at the industry’s power. virginia senator mark warner, the vice chairman of the senate intelligence committee, this month compared political ads on social media to the “wild, wild west” and is working on legislation to require more disclosure. on the republican side, president donald trump has been hostile to the tech industry in many of his public remarks. google and facebook have been repeatedly attacked from the right for alleged liberal bias and a globalist outlook. now, the internet firms are backpedaling from earlier positions as they seek to avoid regulation, according to congressional aides, industry lobbyists and company sources.  “tech is no longer the golden goose,” said one technology industry source, who spoke on condition of anonymity. “maybe it’s a good thing we start behaving like a rational part of the economy.” silicon valley lobbyists and congressional aides in both parties were quick to temper talk of a sweeping regulatory crackdown, in part because the government agencies that could move against the industry, notably the federal trade commission, remain severely understaffed. but the shift in tone is palpable. on thursday, facebook chief executive mark zuckerberg said the company, for the first time, would make it possible for anyone to see details about political ads that run on facebook, which, unlike television ads, do not fall under u.s. law requiring disclosure of who pays for them. requiring such transparency is one of the key provisions of the proposed legislation on online political ads. the company also said it would turn over to congressional investigators political ads that it says were likely purchased by russian entities during and after the 2016 u.s. presidential election. the moves marked an about face for zuckerberg, who after the november election said it was a “crazy idea” to think that activity on facebook swayed the vote. facebook has also shifted its stance on proposed changes to the liability protections for internet companies, formally known as section 230 of the 1996 communications decency act. the legislation, which is aimed at stopping online sex trafficking, has been fiercely opposed by companies that see it as a threat to openness and innovation on the internet.  but after an emotional hearing last week featuring testimony from the mother of a murdered sex trafficking victim   which followed two big tech companies, oracle (orcl.n) and hewlett packard enterprise (hpe.n), breaking ranks with industry peers on the issue   facebook and google have opened the door to negotiation on the bill, according to congressional aides and industry sources. in a statement, erin egan, facebook’s vice president of u.s. policy, said the company believed a legislative solution was possible to “address this terrible problem while ensuring that the internet remains open and free and that responsible companies can continue to work to stop sex trafficking before it happens.” the tech industry in recent years has neutralized other ideas percolating in the halls of congress that it perceived as threatening, including calls to weaken encryption and demands that social media companies report “terrorist” activity to the government. but the effort to amend section 230 is seen as different. the fast progress of legislation, introduced in august, has alarmed lobbyists and company representatives who initially predicted it would not go far in an otherwise gridlocked congress.  the bill comes after years of law enforcement lobbying for a crackdown on the online classified site backpage.com, which is used for sex advertising. the measure would make it easier for states and sex trafficking victims to sue social media networks, advertisers and others who fail to keep exploitative material off their platforms.  republican senator rob portman of ohio, the lead architect of the section 230 legislation, said in an interview with reuters that he was confident his measure would become law this congressional term, with or without silicon valley’s cooperation.  the bill has attracted bipartisan support from nearly a third of the senate; a companion measure has similar backing in the house of representatives. portman said he had met with trump’s daughter and advisor, ivanka trump, who expressed strong support. “frankly, i am disappointed (that) more in the technology industry are not joining us on this effort,” portman said. “it is in their interest to be supportive of a solution on this problem.” ",0
" indian authorities on thursday ordered an inquiry to determine within seven days the cause of a blast at a coal fired power plant that killed 26 people and injured more than 100   one of the country s worst industrial accidents in years. more than 20 survivors were battling for life with severe burn injuries following wednesday s blast at the 1,550 megawatt plant operated by state owned ntpc in northern uttar pradesh state, state officials said. arvind kumar, a principal secretary, said some of the severely injured had been taken to a hospital in the state capital lucknow.  blockages in the flue gas pipe in a unit led to the blast. hot flue gases and steam let out by the blast severely injured several workers,  sanjay kumar khatri, the top government official of rae bareli district where the plant is located, told reuters on thursday.  a magisterial inquiry has been initiated. this two member technical team will submit findings within seven days,  khatri said. ntpc is the country s top power producer and accidents have been rare at its facilities. senior state police official anand kumar said in a statement posted online on wednesday that ash had piled up in the furnace beneath the boiler, which led to building up of pressure resulting in the explosion. the state government has offered cash compensation of 200,000 rupees ($3,097) to the families of the deceased, 50,000 rupees for the severely injured and half of that to those who sustained minor injuries, khatri said. the plant in the town of unchahar supplies electricity to nine states, ntpc s website showed. but the company said other facilities would make up for the shortfall and outages were unlikely. the 500 mw unit, where the mishap occurred, had been operating since april and is under shut down after the accident. the other five units of the station are operating normally, ntpc said in a statement.  this is most unfortunate. ntpc has initiated an inquiry into the incident. we are not a company that will take any risk. we have so many units that if power cannot be supplied by one, it can be given by the other. it was a sudden accident,  an ntpc official, who did not wish to be quoted, said.

" the united nations appealed on monday to countries worldwide to take in 1,300 mainly african refugees stranded in libya, many of them mistreated while kept in appalling conditions in detention. niger has agreed to temporarily host the most vulnerable being evacuated, including unaccompanied children and single mothers, pending their processing and departure for resettlement, the u.n. high commissioner for refugees (unhcr) said in a statement.  in order to address the immediate protection needs and extreme vulnerabilities of the persons of concern who will be evacuated to niger, unhcr urgently requests 1,300 places for resettlement for this situation,  the agency said. the unhcr intends to evacuate between 700 and 1,300 people from libya to niger by the end of january 2018, it said, calling for the resettlement places to be made available by the end of march. a first group of 25 refugees from eritrea, ethiopia and sudan were evacuated from libya to niger last month, it added.  this is a desperate call for solidarity and humanity. we need to get extremely vulnerable refugees out of libya as soon as possible,  said volker turk, unhcr assistant high commissioner for protection. images broadcast by cnn earlier this month appeared to show migrants being auctioned off as slaves by libyan traffickers, sparking outrage in europe and anger in africa.  numbers of detainees swelled after boat departures for italy from the smuggling hub of sabratha were largely blocked this year. on friday, the international organization for migration (iom), called on social media giants to make it harder for people smugglers to use their platforms to lure west african migrants to libya where they can face detention, torture, slavery or death. facebook and whatsapp did not reply to requests by reuters for comment.

" hungary s ruling fidesz party, preparing for elections next april, promised on thursday to highlight what it called a plan by billionaire financier george soros to bring millions of migrants into europe. fidesz asked prime minister viktor orban s government to carry out a  national consultation  about brussels  plans to distribute asylum seekers in the eu, a week after the eu s top court ruled against complainants hungary and slovakia. previous such consultations have taken the form of sending out questionnaires to millions of voters, setting out the government s right wing nationalist position and asking people if they agree. soros, a hungarian born jew who has spent a large part of his fortune funding pro democracy and human rights groups, has been targeted by orban s government repeatedly. his spokesman has described the government s portrayal of his views on immigration as  fantasy . orban has been one of the loudest opponents of mandatory migrant resettlement quotas proposed by the eu, arguing this would undermine its sovereignty and social fabric. his stance has gone down well with voters, and fidesz is firmly ahead in opinion polls. lajos kosa, a party vice chairman, said the national consultation should focus on the alleged soros plan, something that would place migration at the center of the campaign.  the european commission stops just short of saying that they carry out the soros plan... but all their steps and ideas with regard to migration point in this direction,  kosa said, adding last week s eu court defeat for hungary had  opened the gates . soros  spokesman michael vachon in july dismissed the idea that the financier and philanthropist was promoting a scheme to import millions of illegal immigrants into europe.  soros s actual position on migration is that the international community should provide more support to the developing countries that today host 89 percent of refugees and that europe should accept several hundred thousand fully screened refugees through an orderly process of vetting and resettlement,  he said. he said an anti migrant billboard campaign by the hungarian government, showing a smiling soros and carrying the caption  don t let soros have the last laugh , was  reminiscent of europe s darkest hours . the government ended the poster campaign over the summer.

" two senior u.s. senators said on wednesday they want to amend a law allowing lawsuits against saudi arabia over the sept. 11 attacks to narrow the scope of possible lawsuits. lindsey graham and john mccain, two of the republican party’s congressional foreign policy leaders, said they would introduce an amendment to the law so that a government could be sued only if it “knowingly” engages with a terrorist organization. “all we’re saying to any ally of the united states (is), you can’t be sued in the united states for an act of terrorism unless you knowingly were involved, and the same applies to us in your country,” graham said in a senate speech. in september, the senate and house of representatives overwhelmingly rejected president barack obama’s veto of the justice against sponsors of terrorism act, known as jasta, making it u.s. law. however, lawmakers said almost as soon as they did so that  they wanted the scope of the legislation narrowed to ease concerns about its potential effect on americans abroad, which was one reason obama vetoed the measure. the law grants an exception to the legal principle of sovereign immunity in cases of terrorism on u.s. soil, clearing the way for lawsuits seeking damages from the saudi government. riyadh denies longstanding suspicions that it backed the hijackers who attacked the united states in 2001. however, it was not immediately clear whether graham and mccain’s proposal would go anywhere. a group of sept. 11 families, who lobbied intensely for the bill and have strong support in congress, immediately objected to their suggestion because it would weaken the law.

" israel signaled on sunday that it would keep up military strikes across its frontier with syria to prevent any encroachment by iranian allied forces, even as the united states and russia try to build up a ceasefire in the area. u.s. president donald trump and russian president vladimir putin on saturday affirmed joint efforts to stabilize syria as its civil war wanes, including with the expansion of a july 7 truce in the southwestern triangle bordering israel and jordan.  a u.s. state department official said russia had agreed  to work with the syrian regime to remove iranian backed forces a defined distance  from the golan heights frontier with israel, which captured the plateau in the 1967 middle east war. the move, according to one israeli official briefed on the arrangement, is meant to keep rival factions inside syria away from each other, but it would effectively keep iranian linked forces at various distances from the israel held golan as well. those distances would range from as little as 5 7 kms and up to around 30 kms, depending on current rebel positions on the syrian golan, the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the issue. moscow did not immediately provide details on the deal. israel has been lobbying both big powers to deny iran, lebanon s hezbollah and other shi ite militias any permanent bases in syria, and to keep them away from the golan, as they gain ground while helping damascus beat back sunni led rebels.  in televised remarks opening israel s weekly cabinet meeting on sunday, prime minister benjamin netanyahu did not speak about the new u.s. russian arrangement for syria.  his regional cooperation minister, tzachi hanegbi, sounded circumspect about the deal, telling reporters that it  does not meet israel s unequivocal demand the there will not be developments that bring the forces of hezbollah or iran to the israel syria border in the north .  there s reflection here of the understanding that israel has set red lines, and will stand firm on this,  hanegbi said. that was an allusion to israeli military strikes in syria, carried out against suspected hezbollah or iranian arms depots or in retaliation for attacks from the syrian held golan. in the latest incident, the israeli military said it shot down a spy drone on saturday as it overflew the golan. israeli defense minister avigdor lieberman blamed the drone on the syrian government. damascus did not immediately respond. repeating israel s warnings to iran and hezbollah, lieberman said:  we will not allow the shi ite axis to establish syria as its forefront base . russia, which has a long term military garrison in syria, has said it wants foreign forces to quit the country eventually. the u.s. state department official, who briefed reporters on condition of anonymity on saturday, said that goal could be served by russia s pledge to remove iranian linked fighters from the truce zone in southwestern syria.   if this works, this is an auspicious signal, would be an auspicious signal, that our policy objective   the objective that i think so many of us share, of getting these guys out of syria ultimately   that there s a path in that direction,  the official said.

" preet bharara, the top federal prosecutor in manhattan known for pursuing a series of cases targeting public corruption and crime on wall street, said on wednesday he has agreed to remain in his post after donald trump becomes u.s. president. bharara, appointed to his position by democratic president barack obama in 2009, told reporters following a meeting with the republican president elect at trump tower in manhattan that trump asked him to stay on during his administration and he accepted. trump takes office on jan. 20. “we had a good meeting,” bharara said. “i said i would absolutely consider staying on. i agreed to stay on.” the announcement’s timing, when trump has not yet finished filling all cabinet level positions, was unusual. but some former prosecutors who served under bharara said they were not surprised their former boss would be willing to remain as the u.s. attorney for the southern district of new york. “i think preet is an independent, law enforcement minded prosecutor who loves his job and is clearly talented in it,” said arlo devlin brown, a former chief of bharara’s public corruption unit who is now a partner at the law firm covington & burling. u.s. senator charles schumer of new york, the incoming senate democratic leader who bharara previously worked for as chief counsel, said trump called him last week to ask what he thought about bharara staying in his job. “i am glad they met and am glad preet is staying on,” schumer said in a statement. “he’s been one of the best u.s. attorneys new york has ever seen.” bharara’s office has pursued an aggressive push against corruption in state and city politics, an agenda that could fit with trump’s vow to “drain the swamp” in washington. those political investigations led last year to the convictions of former new york assembly speaker sheldon silver, a democrat, and former new york senate majority leader dean skelos, a republican, in separate corruption trials. bharara also brought dozens of successful cases against insider traders and was on the cover of time magazine in 2012 with the headline “this man is busting wall st.” those cases include the 2011 conviction of galleon group founder raj rajaratnam, who is serving an 11 year prison term, and a $1.8 billion settlement and plea deal in 2013 with hedge fund sac capital advisors lp. his 227 lawyer office also secured corporate settlements with companies including general motors co and jpmorgan chase & co; won several convictions and guilty pleas of former employees of ponzi scheme operator bernard madoff; and prosecuted suleiman abu ghaith, a son in law of the late al qaeda leader osama bin laden. bharara’s office’s priorities have often matched those set by obama’s justice department. amid an increase in civil rights investigations nationally, for example, bharara’s office joined a lawsuit that led to a settlement in 2015 aimed at reducing violence in new york city’s rikers island jail complex. how priorities set by the justice department under trump’s pick for attorney general, republican senator jeff sessions of alabama, affects the cases bharara’s office pursues remains unclear. “obviously there is likely be some changes in priorities from main justice (the department’s washington headquarters), and the office will have to adjust to those,” said richard zabel, who previously served as bharara’s deputy before becoming hedge fund elliott management’s general counsel. bharara said his office had for the past seven years pursued its work “independently, without fear or favor.” former prosecutors they expect that to stay the same. “he would have only taken it on if he were 100 percent confident that that independence could be preserved,” said matthew schwartz, partner at the law firm boies, schiller & flexner and a former prosecutor under bharara.

" it was classic hillary clinton, ignoring medical advice and attending a ceremony on a sultry new york city day while battling pneumonia   a decision ex aides and other associates speculated was rooted in her longstanding desire to prove that women can compete in the male dominated world of politics. the move backfired on the famously stoic democratic presidential candidate after she had to leave sunday’s september. 11 remembrance early and was caught on camera buckling from dehydration as she was helped into a van.  clinton, 68, has since acknowledged she went too far in trying to soldier on with a jam packed schedule. daniel scherb, a south bend, indiana, cardiologist interviewed by reuters, who was not privy to clinton’s medical records, said pneumonia can leave a patient “feeling blah for seven to 10 days” under the best of circumstances and, at worst, “people can die from it.” former subordinates who are fiercely loyal to clinton said there are plenty of instances in which she drove herself remarkably hard as first lady from 1993 2001, as a u.s. senator from 2001 2009 and as u.s. secretary of state from 2009 2013. in her first year at the state department in 2009, she traveled abroad extensively shortly after undergoing surgery for a broken arm. one retired ambassador said clinton sees herself as part of a generation of women who had to work extra hard to overcome barriers to female advancement. the ambassador describes this as part of an ethos that “you could never be weaker than a man.” at the same time, the ambassador blamed clinton’s aides in part for allowing her to put herself into difficult situations. at an event in congo after breaking her arm, clinton snapped at someone who posed a question she disliked, the ambassador recalled. while the question may have been translated into english incorrectly, the ambassador said clinton also was clearly exhausted. “it’s not necessarily that she is running roughshod over the advice of her staff. her staff doesn’t seem to take very good care of her,” the ambassador said. working to defeat republican presidential candidate donald trump, 70, on the rough and tumble campaign trail, clinton has said she is held to a different standard. “women are seen through a different lens,” clinton told humans of new york, a group organized around a project to photograph and catalog stories of new yorkers. “i’ve learned that i can’t be quite so passionate in my presentation,” she said, adding, “i love to wave my arms, but apparently that’s a little bit scary to people. and i can’t yell too much. it comes across as ‘too loud’ or ‘too shrill’ or ‘too this’ or ‘too that,’” even though those attending her rallies “are loving it.” in all her roles, including as president bill clinton’s healthcare chief and a two time presidential candidate, clinton has been known as an almost unstoppable, detail oriented policy wonk. “her constant work, internal in meetings or external on capitol hill, was virtually incomprehensible,” said david dreyer, a white house deputy communications director during bill clinton’s first term. dreyer, who said he had a “front row seat” to the healthcare reform fight that hillary clinton spearheaded as first lady, said she is “wired” to always be fully prepared and compelled to public service. ‘can’t win situation’ three other people, one close to clinton when she was secretary of state and as a presidential candidate, said efforts to persuade her to temper her travel and appearance schedule can go nowhere because she insists it is expected of her. one, a prominent former official who has advised clinton on foreign policy issues, said: “she pushes herself so hard because she’s convinced that only she can do what needs to be done, and that’s compounded by a very small inner circle that in some cases doesn’t like to contradict or confront her, and as a result just ends up encouraging this compulsion.” matt bennett, who served as deputy assistant for intergovernmental affairs in bill clinton’s second presidential term, said hillary clinton is “in a can’t win situation here.” noting competing, unsubstantiated attacks from trump and his supporters about her health versus criticisms that she does not know how to pace herself, “either she is frail or reckless with her health.” bennett added, “i don’t view her as disregarding medical advice” over past blood clots, a fall that caused a concussion and other maladies. “but i do think she’s super tough.” bennett, now a vice president at the third way think tank, said the increasingly frantic pace of campaigning for the white house has pressed candidates to the limit. as an aide to retired general wesley clark while he unsuccessfully sought the democratic presidential nomination in 2004, bennett noted that clark would constantly remark about the rigors of the campaign. “he was shot multiple times in vietnam and went through (elite army) ranger training and he’s saying this is really tough running for president.” ",0
" more than 40 lawmakers urged the trump administration on wednesday to reimpose u.s. travel bans on myanmar’s military leaders and prepare targeted sanctions against those responsible for a crackdown on the country’s rohingya muslim minority. in a letter sent to u.s. secretary of state rex tillerson, a group of republican and democratic members of the house of representatives called for “meaningful steps” against myanmar’s military and others who have committed human rights abuses in an offensive that has driven more than 500,000 rohingya muslims out of the southeast asian nation. “burma’s authorities appear to be in denial of what has happened,” stated the letter. “we urge you to do everything possible to ensure protection and security for those trapped inside burma or willing to return, as well as oppose forcible returns from neighboring countries.” ",0
" embattled republican u.s. senate candidate roy moore said on monday the allegations of sexual misconduct against him were evidence of the moral failings of leaders in washington and meant to distract attention from the real issues. hitting the campaign trail for the first time in more than two weeks, when the charges first disrupted the race, moore said the allegations were false and malicious and politicians in both parties were desperate to see him fail. “this is simply dirty politics. it’s a sign of the immorality of our times,” moore told about 125 supporters who jammed a rural community center in northeast alabama, speaking just over two weeks before a dec. 12 special election to fill the senate seat vacated by jeff sessions when he was appointed u.s. attorney general earlier this year. republican lawmakers in washington, including senate republican leader mitch mcconnell, have rushed to distance themselves from moore and called for him to step down from the race after he was accused by several women of sexual assault and misconduct when they were teenagers and he was in his early 30s. reuters has not been able to independently verify those allegations. moore said the allegations were designed to distract from “the true issues” facing people and that senate leaders understood he was difficult to manage and did not want to deal with him. “politicians will stop at nothing to win an election,” said moore, who has accused the media of joining in the effort to malign him. outside the rally, a man wearing a moore sticker pushed away a cameraman as he attempted to film moore’s arrival, local media reported. a reporter for the birmingham news, in a tweet, identified the man as tony goolsby, the dekalb county chairman for the moore campaign. president donald trump defended moore last week, but a white house official said trump would not campaign for moore before the dec. 12 special election. trump has repeatedly slammed moore’s democratic opponent, doug jones, a former u.s. attorney, calling him a liberal and saying that jones would not vote for a tax overhaul plan now being debated in congress. republicans hold a slim 52 48 majority in the senate and are eager to maintain their advantage to pass trump’s legislative agenda on taxes, healthcare and other priorities. but republican senator richard shelby of alabama told reporters on monday he had not voted for moore, writing in a candidate instead. he did not say whom he wrote in. moore had largely stayed off the campaign trail and avoided questions since the allegations first surfaced in the washington post. the jones campaign has taken notice and begun criticizing his absence. before the rally, a moore representative warned the crowd against any “outbursts” and said moore would not be taking questions.

" a u.s. senate panel probing alleged russian interference in the 2016 election abruptly canceled an interview with president donald trump’s lawyer michael cohen on tuesday after he issued a statement about his testimony in violation of committee policy. “the committee expects witnesses in this investigation to work in good faith with the senate,” senate intelligence committee chairman richard burr and vice chairman mark warner said in a statement after canceling the closed door session. cohen was later asked to appear at an open hearing on oct. 25. burr, a republican, and warner, a democrat, said it was against the committee’s policy for witnesses to make public comments before being interviewed. the intelligence panel, other congressional committees and special counsel robert mueller are investigating whether russia intervened to tilt the 2016 election in trump’s favor and whether trump or top aides colluded with moscow. the russian government denies any attempt to influence the election, and the republican president has repeatedly denied any collusion, calling the investigations a “witch hunt.” the allegations have shadowed the first months of trump’s presidency.  two people familiar with the matter told reuters that trump was using money donated to his re election campaign and the republican national committee to pay for his lawyers in the probe.  while previous presidential campaigns have used those funds to pay routine legal fees, trump would be the first u.s. president in the modern campaign finance era to use them to cover the costs of responding to a criminal probe, election law experts said. in his statement, cohen denied that he or trump colluded with russia to interfere in the election, and said such charges were made to discredit trump’s presidency. “i emphatically state that i had nothing to do with any russian involvement in our electoral process,” cohen’s statement said. “given my own proximity to the president of the united states as a candidate, let me also say that i never saw anything   not a hint of anything   that demonstrated his involvement in russian interference in our election or any form of russia collusion,” cohen said. cohen and his attorney, stephen ryan, had traveled to capitol hill for the closed door interview with committee investigators, but were told the meeting had been postponed. “we didn’t want to send a message except for what we do is behind closed doors,” burr later told reporters at the capitol. the committee had changed its policy since trump’s son in law and close adviser, jared kushner, issued an 11 page statement before meeting with intelligence committee staff in july, he said. asked if the committee would subpoena cohen, burr said he did not think it would need to. cohen’s name surfaced in a dossier compiled by former british intelligence officer christopher steele that reported cohen played an important role in liaison with the russian government and secretly met with kremlin officials in prague in august 2016. the steele dossier, cohen said in his statement, was “riddled with falsehoods and intentionally salacious allegations.” “i have never in my life been to prague or to anywhere in the czech republic,” he said. current and former u.s. intelligence officials have said that while they cannot verify all the details in the steele dossier, neither have they debunked it entirely.    former utah governor jon huntsman, trump’s nominee to be ambassador to russia, said at his senate confirmation hearing on tuesday: “there is no question, underline no question, that the russian government interfered in the u.s. election last year.”  he pledged to bring up the issue with the government there. huntsman previously served as u.s. ambassador to china under democratic president barack obama.

" the u.s. house of representatives voted overwhelmingly on tuesday to slap new sanctions on russia and force president donald trump to obtain lawmakers’ permission before easing any sanctions on moscow, in a rare rebuke of the republican president. it was unclear how quickly the bill would make its way to the white house for trump to sign into law or veto. the bill still must be passed by the senate, which is mired in debate over efforts to overhaul the u.s. healthcare system as lawmakers try to clear the decks to leave washington for their summer recess. the sanctions bill comes as lawmakers investigate possible meddling by russia in the 2016 presidential election and potential collusion by republican trump’s campaign. moscow has denied it worked to influence the election in trump’s favor, and he has denied his campaign colluded. the white house said the president had not yet decided whether he would sign the measure. rejecting the bill   which would potentially hamper his hopes of pursuing improved relations with moscow   would carry a risk that his veto could be overridden by lawmakers. “while the president supports tough sanctions on north korea, iran and russia, the white house is reviewing the house legislation and awaits a final legislative package for the president’s desk,” said spokeswoman sarah sanders. house members backed the bill, which also imposes sanctions on iran and north korea, by a near unanimous margin of 419 3, with strong support from trump’s fellow republicans as well as democrats, despite objections from trump, who wanted more control over the ability to impose sanctions. the republican controlled senate passed an earlier version of the bill with near unanimous support. the house added the north korea measures after becoming frustrated with the senate’s failure to advance a bill it passed in may. representative ed royce, the republican chairman of the house foreign affairs committee, said the three countries “are threatening vital u.s. interests and destabilizing their neighbors. it is well past time that we forcefully respond.” but the combined bill has run into objections from some senators, who are unhappy that the house added the north korea sanctions after holding up the measure for more than a month. senate leaders have not said when they might consider the house bill. senator bob corker, the republican chairman of the senate foreign relations committee, said he was not sure the bill would “fly through” his chamber. “the only language we agreed to was iran and russia. so adding north korea on, i just don’t know how we’re going to deal with it yet,” corker told reporters. “the better route would have been to send over what had been agreed to.” the bill had raised concerns in the european union, where u.s. allies depend on supplies of russian gas. but house members said the bill was tweaked to try to alleviate the worries of europeans and the energy sector. the intense focus on russia, involving several congressional probes and a separate investigation by a justice department appointed special counsel, robert mueller, has overshadowed trump’s agenda. the scrutiny has angered and frustrated the president, who calls the investigations a politically motivated witch hunt fueled by democrats who cannot accept his upset win in last november’s election against democratic candidate hillary clinton, a former u.s. secretary of state. without offering evidence, trump lashed out on twitter on tuesday about “ukrainian efforts to sabotage” his presidential campaign in order to aid clinton. the ukrainian embassy in washington denied the accusations. the senate judiciary committee had been set to compel trump’s former campaign manager, paul manafort, to testify at a hearing on wednesday, but rescinded the subpoena late on tuesday as negotiations over his participation continued. manafort has started turning over documents to the committee and is negotiating a date to be interviewed, the panel said in a statement. the committee is looking at a june 2016 meeting in new york with a russian lawyer organized by trump’s eldest son, donald trump jr. trump jr. released emails this month that showed he welcomed the prospect of receiving damaging information at the meeting about clinton. on friday, the panel had asked that manafort and trump jr. appear at the wednesday hearing, but a witness list released on tuesday evening included neither of their names.  manafort met with senate intelligence committee staff on tuesday morning, his spokesman said. on tuesday, trump’s son in law, jared kushner, spent three hours with the house of representatives intelligence panel, his second straight day on capitol hill answering questions about his contacts with russians during the campaign. kushner had a “very productive session” with the house intelligence committee, democratic representative adam schiff said after the meeting. republican representative michael conaway said kushner was “straightforward and forthcoming. he wanted to answer every question that we had.” kushner, who is now a top aide in trump’s white house, told reporters on monday he had no part in any kremlin plot.. u.s. house republicans on tuesday rejected a legislative effort by democrats to obtain treasury department documents that could show any ties between the finances of trump, his inner circle and the russian government.

" the attorney for former trump campaign manager paul manafort said on monday there was no evidence manafort colluded with the russian government while working for the campaign and in fact his work on behalf of ukraine had ended two years earlier. “i think you all saw today that president donald trump was correct. there is no evidence that mr. manafort or the trump campaign colluded with the russian government,” attorney kevin downing told reporters after manafort pleaded not guilty to money laundering and other charges. “mr. manafort represented pro european union campaigns for the ukrainians and ... was seeking to further democracy and to help the ukraine come closer to the united states and the eu,” downing said. “those activities ended in 2014 over two years before mr. manafort served in the trump campaign.” ",0
" the illinois house passed $817 million in spending on thursday to provide “life line” funding to higher education and social service and health programs that have been starved for cash due to the state’s budget impasse. the measure passed in a 64 45 vote over republican governor bruce rauner’s opposition to another stopgap spending measure. a six month temporary budget for the fiscal year that ends june 30 expired on dec. 31. illinois is limping towards the end of a second straight fiscal year without a complete budget due to a stalemate between rauner and democrats who control the legislature. the country’s fifth largest state has been operating on continuing appropriations and court ordered spending, while its pile of unpaid bills reached nearly $13 billion on wednesday. the bill would tap money from the state’s commitment to human services and education assistance funds to direct $258 million to pay for dozens of programs, including senior meals  and crime prevention, and indigent burials. another $559 million would go to state universities, community colleges, and educational grants for low income students. the bill’s sponsor, democratic state representative greg harris, said the so called life line measure would allow social service organizations and state universities “to continue to exist.” he cited a united way survey released on wednesday that showed 69 percent of social service agencies had received no payments or partial payments from the state so far in fiscal 2017, forcing 49 percent of the agencies to reduce services.  he said universities had resorted to program cuts and layoffs. republican lawmakers contended that passage of a stopgap measure would take the pressure off the legislature to finally pass a full budget. “the reality is we don’t do things around here without pressure,” said republican state representative steven andersson. the measure will now head to the senate, which is on break until april 25. a spokesman for democratic senate president john cullerton said the bill would be reviewed. earlier on thursday, rauner voiced opposition to another stopgap budget. “we’ve been doing that for decades, and it’s created the crisis and mess we’re in,” he told reporters in decatur. “that’s a failure to do stopgaps. let’s do a balanced budget so the problem is fixed.”  after a bipartisan bill package aimed at ending the impasse stalled in the senate last month, credit rating agencies warned that illinois’ credit ratings, the lowest among the 50 states, could sink even lower.

" the pentagon is expected to submit to congress on tuesday president barack obama’s long awaited plan for closing the u.s. military prison at guantanamo bay, setting up a battle with lawmakers who oppose his efforts. obama, whose pledge to shut the facility at the u.s. naval base in cuba dates back to the start of his presidency in 2009, is seeking to make good on his promise before he leaves office next january. pentagon spokesman captain jeff davis said the administration intended to meet tuesday’s deadline to present its detailed proposal for closing the facility. there are still 91 prisoners detained there. “we understand the deadline is tomorrow and it’s our intent to meet it,” davis told reporters. u.s. officials have said the plan would call for sending to their homelands or third countries detainees who have been cleared for transfer, now numbering 35, and bringing remaining prisoners, possibly several dozen, to u.s. soil to be held in maximum security prisons. congress has banned such transfers to the united states since 2011. another option that will be cited in the administration’s blueprint will be the possibility of sending some prisoners overseas for prosecution and trial, one u.s. official said. the closure plan could also serve as a template for how to deal with future terrorism suspects captured in the fight against the islamic state militant group. however, the document will not name the alternative u.s. prisons under consideration for housing detainees, u.s. officials said. the administration wants to avoid fueling any political outcry over specific sites during a u.s. presidential election year. still, pentagon officials have already surveyed a federal prison in florence, colorado, a military jail at fort leavenworth, kansas, and the navy brig at charleston, south carolina. an effort will also be made to speed up parole style reviews to determine whether more prisoners can be added to the group cleared for release, officials said. the plan will include costs for upgrading u.s. facilities and housing the inmates there, according to a source familiar with the matter. the white house last year rejected one pentagon proposal as too expensive, sending it back for revisions. republicans and some democrats in congress largely oppose proposals to move any of the prisoners to the united states. republican senator kelly ayotte said on monday the obama administration refused to “level with the american people regarding the terrorist activities and affiliations of the detainees who remain at guantanamo.” white house spokesman josh earnest reiterated obama’s view of guantanamo as a terrorist “recruiting tool” and urged lawmakers to look at the plan “with an open mind,” although he expressed doubt about whether they would do so. the white house has left open the possibility that obama might resort to executive powers to close the facility. the prison was opened in 2002 by former republican president george w. bush to house foreign terrorism suspects rounded up after the sept. 11, 2001 attacks on new york and washington. the united states quickly drew criticism from human rights activists and foreign governments over guantanamo, where most prisoners have been held for more than a decade without trial.

" hurricane irma s path of destruction up florida s gulf coast on sunday threatens to disrupt a thriving state tourism industry worth more than $100 billion annually just months ahead of the busy winter travel season. some of the state s biggest attractions have announced temporary closures, including amusement park giants walt disney world s magic kingdom, universal studios, legoland and sea world, which all planned to close through monday.  about 20 cruise lines have miami as a home port or a port of call, according to the portmiami website, and many have had to move ships out of the area and revise schedules.  carnival cruise lines and royal caribbean have canceled and revised several sailings as a result of the storm and have offered credits and waivers on trips where passengers are unable to travel.  a carnival spokesman said the situation in florida on sunday was still not clear enough to fully assess how widespread the effects will be.  we will know more in the hours ahead since the hurricane is active in florida right now,  spokesman roger frizzell said. irma made a second florida landfall on sunday on southwestern marco island as a category 3 storm bringing winds of 115 miles per hour (185 kph) and life threatening sea surge. disney canceled the monday sailing of one of its cruise ships and said it is assessing future sailings, which stop throughout the caribbean and in the bahamas.  florida is one of the world s top tourism destinations. last year nearly 113 million people visited the state, a new record, and spent $109 billion, state officials said earlier this year. the first half of 2017 was on track to beat that record pace, officials said.      the damage irma s winds and storm surge do to florida s 660 miles (1,060 km) of beaches and the structures built along them during more than 30 years of explosive population growth will be critical to how quickly the state s  s no. 1 industry recovers. the gulf beaches west of st. petersburg and clearwater,  are squarely in the storm s path.  in 2016, more than 6.3 million people visited pinellas county, which encompasses those cities, and generated more $9.7 billion in economic activity. up and down the wide, sandy beaches of pinellas county are traditional  old florida  waterfront hotels such as the don cesar, a coral pink 1920s hotel on st. pete beach, which was closed by the storm. there are also modern high rises and resorts that are part of the nation s biggest chains and brands including hyatt hotels, marriott international, intercontinental hotels group, hilton hotels & resorts and ritz carlton hotel company. the low lying barrier islands would be inundated if irma s storm surge reaches forecast heights of as high as 15 feet (4.6 meters).  while some newer structures in the area are built on elevated pilings, many older homes and businesses are not.

" german chancellor angela merkel appointed jan hecker, her refugee policy coordinator, as her new foreign policy adviser, as she braced for tricky talks on a new coalition government next week, where immigration is likely to be a key issue, a government spokeswoman said. merkel, humbled in last month s national election by a surge of the anti immigrant far right, is seeking to put together a three way coalition of her conservatives, the pro business free democrats and the environmentalist greens   a combination previously untested at the federal level. members of her conservative bloc resolved their own differences and agreed to limiting migration on monday, paving the way for talks to begin with the other parties. hecker, a former federal judge, took over the newly created position of refugee coordinator in october 2015 after merkel s decision to allow in over a million migrants. he led germany s migration treaties with african states and accompanied merkel on a number of foreign trips focused on migration. the decision reflects  growing awareness that refugee and asylum policies are inextricably linked to security issues,  said judy dempsey, a senior fellow at carnegie europe.  he had the overview of libya, of the traffickers, of the security of the borders, of the agreement with turkey,  she said. hecker replaces christoph heusgen, who had advised merkel for all 12 years of her role as chancellor, before becoming germany s u.n. ambassador in new york in late july. with hecker s appointment, merkel breaks for the second time with a longstanding tradition of tapping diplomats to fill foreign and political jobs in the chancellery.

" soldiers shot dead at least eight people and wounded others in cameroon s restless english speaking regions on sunday during protests by activists calling for its independence from the majority francophone nation, an official and witnesses said. the demonstrations   timed to take place on the anniversary of anglophone cameroon s independence from britain   came as a months old movement against perceived marginalization by the francophone dominated government gathered pace.  the protests, which began late last year, have become a lightning rod for opposition to president paul biya s 35 year rule. donatus njong fonyuy, mayor of the town of kumbo, said five prisoners were killed at around 6 a.m. (0500 gmt) after the jail where they were being held caught fire.   we don t know what caused the fire in the prison ... but five prisoners were killed by soldiers. two were wounded by bullets and are at the hospital,  he told reuters, adding that another two civilians were also injured. in other incidents in kumbo, soldiers shot and killed a demonstrator and wounded two others who had raised the blue and white flag of the ambazonia separatist movement in the town. another woman was killed inside her home, fonyuy said, without giving further details. police and army officials were not immediately available to comment on the shootings.  we won t use violence unless there is major cause. there are numerous risks, even terrorist risks. we re keeping calm,  a security source, who declined to be identified because he was not authorized to speak to journalists, said earlier in the day. writing on his official facebook account, president biya condemned the violence.   let me make this very clear: it is not forbidden to voice any concerns in the republic. however, nothing great can be achieved by using verbal excesses, street violence, and defying authority,  he said.  cameroon s divide has its roots in the end of world war one, when the league of nations divided the former german colony of kamerun between the allied french and british victors.  authorities had banned all gatherings of more than four people, ordered bus stations, eateries and shops to shut and forbade movement between different parts of the english speaking regions ahead of the protests. the government also ordered cameroon s border with nigeria closed for the weekend. access to popular social media and messaging apps, including facebook, twitter and whatsapp, was disrupted from friday. communications minister issa tchiroma bakary on sunday threatened to shut any media outlets giving a voice to separatists, saying they  must not encourage those who advocate division, who want to destroy and destabilize our country . businesses were shuttered in the regions  main cities, buea and bamenda, where military helicopters circled overhead. the security deployment included troops from the cameroonian army s rapid intervention brigade, a unit that typically fights islamist boko haram militants in the country s north. one protester was killed on the edge of buea as security forces attempted to block pro independence marchers from entering the city, three witnesses said.  hundreds nevertheless slipped through the countryside to get around the blockade and into the city, where security forces used teargas to try to stop them from marching on the regional governor s office.  a reuters witness also heard gunfire, though it was not clear whether the shots were targeting protesters or being fired in the air.  the military, which is supposed to protect lives and property, has turned into our greatest nightmare,  said one buea resident, who asked not to be identified out of fear of reprisal.  in bamenda, where a bomb attack blamed on separatists wounded three policemen last week, young men brandishing improvised secessionist flags clashed with security forces who attempted to disperse them with teargas.  thousands of government supporters meanwhile marched in douala, cameroon s main port city and its commercial hub, voicing their opposition to calls for independence or more autonomy for the anglophone regions.   we are here ... to reject sectarianism, to condemn all kinds of hate, all forms of violence carried out under any pretext whatsoever,  justice minister laurent esso told the pro government crowd.

" hackers targeted the computer systems of presidential candidate donald trump and republican party organizations as well as democratic party networks, sources familiar with investigations into the attacks said. at least one trump staff member’s email account was infected with malware in 2015 and sent malicious emails to colleagues, according to one insider for the republican candidate’s campaign and an outside security expert. it was unclear whether or not the hackers actually gained access to campaign computers. in the past month, u.s. security officials have said that starting last year, hackers infiltrated computers of the democratic national committee (dnc), the presidential campaign of hillary clinton and her party’s congressional fundraising committee. u.s. officials said they have concluded that russia or its proxies were responsible, leading to calls by some democrats and cyber security officials for the obama administration to blame russia publicly. kremlin officials have dismissed the allegations as absurd, but there is anxiety in washington over the possibility that a foreign power might be using hacked information to meddle in the nov. 8 u.s. election. the trump campaign has hired security firm crowdstrike, which also is assisting the democratic national committee, according to one person briefed on the matter. the company declined to comment.a different outside security firm was hired to examine software the trump and clinton campaigns use to manage mailings, electronic outreach and other campaign efforts, another person who was briefed on the issue said.a spokeswoman for trump’s campaign declined to comment. a spokesman for the republican national committee could not immediately be reached for comment. the tools and techniques used to hack republican targets resemble those employed in attacks on democratic party organizations, including the dnc and clinton’s campaign organization, two sources said. that has led u.s. officials to reach a preliminary assessment that russia’s military and civilian intelligence agencies or their proxies have targeted both political parties. attempts to hack into republican political organizations over an extended period were reported in intelligence bulletins circulated by u.s. agencies, four sources said. they did not disclose the identities of the organizations. two u.s. security officials said the fbi and the department of homeland security have offered assistance to both political parties in identifying possible intrusions and upgrading their defenses against what one of the officials called “constantly evolving threats.” ",0
" peruvian president pedro pablo kuczynski said on thursday that authorities leading an expanding graft investigation into brazilian builder odebrecht had gone too far by raiding the offices of the rightwing opposition party that rules congress. the attorney general s office has spent the past year working to identify the recipients of bribes that odebrecht has admitted paying to secure contracts over a decade long period in peru, one of a dozen nations where it has acknowledged crimes. after entangling two former presidents this year, the investigation has gathered steam again in recent weeks, with four executives of local construction companies jailed pending trial and a former mayor named as a suspect. on thursday, prosecutors investigating odebrecht s financing of political campaigns searched the offices of the rightwing opposition party popular force, prompting party representatives to accuse the attorney general s office of political bias. in a rare gesture of sympathy for a party that often attacks him, kuczynski called for prosecutors and other state authorities to  respect the rules of the game.   it worries me to read the news about a raid this morning on the lima offices of the political party that dominates congress. and i m not saying this to ingratiate myself with congress. i m saying this because if there isn t respect for due process, we won t be respected internationally,  kuczynski said in a televised speech at an event with local mayors. kuczynski s remarks come as popular force is preparing legislation to oust attorney general pablo sanchez, who has repeatedly denied political bias and said his office was only working to fight corruption and impunity. sanchez did not immediately respond to requests for comment.     the raids at the offices of popular force were authorized by judge richard concepcion, who earlier this year ordered ex presidents ollanta humala and alejandro toledo to be held in pre trial detention while prosecutors prepare criminal charges.  this is an affront to the party,  popular force secretary general jose chlimper told reporters in front of one of the party s offices as prosecutors worked inside.  they re looking for something that they re not going to find.  popular force s leader, twice defeated presidential candidate keiko fujimori, is under investigation for allegedly laundering money for odebrecht during her 2011 campaign, which she has repeatedly denied. in recent weeks, popular force lawmakers have criticized kuczynski for declining to undergo questioning in congress after local media reported he worked for odebrecht as a consultant. kuczynski has denied the allegations and sent written responses to lawmakers  questions.

" in formulating a new executive order limiting travel to the united states, president donald trump has promised to make the directive harder to fight successfully in court than the one he issued in january.  one way the administration will likely try to do that, legal experts say, is to shape the order more narrowly to undercut the opportunity for states and other opponents to sue by showing courts they have “standing,” or the ability to argue the president’s order causes them harm. but legal experts said a new order, which a white house source said was expected this week, was unlikely to fully eliminate the ability of challengers to pursue legal actions.  more than two dozen lawsuits were filed in u.s. courts against the initial travel ban, which temporarily barred travelers from iran, iraq, libya, somalia, sudan, syria and yemen. in one case, which ultimately got the order temporarily suspended, the state of washington claimed standing in part because the ban affected washington residents living and working legally in the united states as permanent residents known as green card holders.  by excluding legal permanent residents from a new order, something the administration has said is likely, the president would make it harder for opponents to challenge the ban. larry klayman, founder of the conservative advocacy group freedom watch, said that with a narrower order, legal standing could be a real problem for potential challengers. “if you’re not a citizen, or if you’re not a permanent resident, you have no constitutional rights,” klayman said. trump has said travel limitations are necessary to protect the united states from attacks by islamist militants. americans were deeply divided over the measure, which had some support but was condemned by prominent u.s. companies and allies. the initial order caused chaos at airports, as people,  including green card holders initially, were temporarily blocked from entering the united states.  some of those people, and several states, challenged the order. the 9th u.s. circuit court of appeals, ruling in the washington case, said the ban likely violated the state’s due process rights and suspended it.  the 9th circuit also ruled that washington had legal standing to challenge the ban, over objections from the department of justice.  stephen legomsky, former chief counsel for u.s. citizenship and immigration services under president barack obama, said a narrower ban “weakens the arguments for standing but doesn’t entirely eliminate them.” legomsky noted that, “in general the constitution does not apply to people outside the united states, but that is not iron clad.”  a u.s. citizen whose spouse was barred from visiting by the order, for instance, could argue that he or she had standing to challenge it. or a state university might argue that the order negatively affected it.  in its ruling, the 9th circuit said washington state had standing because it was harmed by trump’s order, specifically noting that faculty at the state’s universities from those seven countries would be prohibited from traveling for research or academic collaboration.  “the universities’ reputations depend on the success of their professors’ research,” the court wrote. the one thing legal experts on all sides of the issue agree on is that the new order will be challenged in courts.  “no matter what they do there will be litigation,” said stephen yale loehr. he said he thinks it likely challengers will be able to establish standing, leaving the courts to decide whether the ban is legal. at that point, yale loehr says, the wording of the new order will become crucial. “if they limit the executive order to people who have never been to the u.s. before, they might win on the merits eventually,” he said.

" fbi director james comey said on wednesday it made him “mildly nauseous” to think his announcement of the reopening of an investigation into hillary clinton’s emails affected the 2016 presidential election, but he had no regrets and would make the same decision again. in four hours of testimony before the senate judiciary committee, comey delivered his most impassioned defense yet of a decision that many democrats believe cost them the white house: telling congress 11 days before the nov. 8 election that the fbi had uncovered a new trove of clinton related emails. comey said he felt he had to speak out at that time because he had repeatedly told lawmakers the clinton email probe was over. “to not speak about it would require an act of concealment in my view,” comey said. “concealing, in my view, would be catastrophic.” he told the panel one reason for the fbi’s renewed interest in clinton’s case was that investigators had found emails, some of them classified, forwarded by clinton’s assistant huma abedin to her husband, who was not authorized to see such information. “it makes me mildly nauseous to think that we might have had some impact on the election, but honestly, it wouldn’t change the decision,” comey said. the fbi, which is supposed to remain politically neutral, said a few days later that the new emails did not change its  decision not to recommend criminal charges against clinton, but many democrats believe the political damage was done. clinton said on tuesday her election bid was derailed in part by comey’s announcement about the renewed probe of her use of a private email server while she was secretary of state. she said her effort also was damaged by the wikileaks release of her campaign chairman john podesta’s emails, allegedly stolen by russian hackers.         senator dianne feinstein, ranking member on the committee, led the democrats in hammering comey with questions about why he went public with the clinton probe but kept silent on an  investigation related to the republican candidate, donald trump. “it’s still very unclear   and i hope director that you will clear this up   why the fbi’s treatment of these two investigations was so dramatically different,” she asked.  u.s. intelligence agencies in december accused russia of hacking of democratic emails in an effort to tilt the election to trump. comey confirmed in march the fbi was investigating possible collusion between trump surrogates and russia. comey said on wednesday the probe into whether russian hacking activities and american citizens was a classified investigation in its early stages – far different from the almost completed email probe.   comey declined to comment on whether trump, or anyone else, had been ruled out as a possible subject. moscow has denied the hacking allegations. the fbi director acknowledged recent months have been difficult. “but i think i’ve done the right thing at each turn. i’m not on anybody’s side. it’s so hard for people to see that,” comey said, adding later, “i don’t have any regrets.” ",0
" khizr khan, the father of a decorated american soldier killed in iraq, lashed out at republican presidential candidate donald trump on tuesday for saying his son would still be alive if trump had been president at the time. “for this candidate to put his political expediency ahead of any realization of pain and suffering of the families is shameful,” khan said in an interview with cnn. the new york businessman raised the name of u.s. army captain humayun khan in a sunday night presidential debate while  criticizing democratic rival hillary clinton for voting in favor of the 2003 invasion of iraq when she was a u.s. senator. “if i was president at that time he would be alive today,” trump said. despite his assertion that he always opposed the war, trump had expressed support for it in a 2002 interview. khizr khan had delivered a speech to the democratic national convention in july showcasing his son’s military service and criticizing trump’s campaign call for a temporary ban on muslims entering the country. trump responded at the time by questioning whether khan’s wife, ghazala khan, was not “allowed” to speak when she appeared next to her husband on the stage, an insinuation of some conservative form of islam that embroiled the candidate in an unpopular dispute with the muslim parents of a fallen war hero.  the khans were stunned to hear trump bring up the name of their son, who was killed in 2004, in sunday’s nationally televised debate, the father said. “we were not only shocked, we were saddened for such disingenuous expression of his thinking and of his feeling,” khan said. trump has said he has modified his call for a ban on muslims entering the country to a plan for “extreme vetting.” ",0
" twitter inc representatives will meet with the u.s. senate select committee on intelligence staff next week in relation to inquiries into the 2016 u.s. presidential election, a company representative said. the committee, along with other congressional committees and special counsel robert mueller, is investigating possible links between president donald trump’s campaign and russia. twitter’s meeting with the committee comes amid mounting pressure on regulators and silicon valley companies to open up the opaque world of online political ads and to prevent governments from using them to sway elections or attempt other meddling. facebook said earlier this month that a russia based operation spent $100,000 on thousands of ads on its social media platform promoting ‘divisive’ messages before and after last year’s presidential election. after facebook’s revelations, democrats have urged the federal election commission to require transparency for social media advertising. russia continues to deny meddling in the election, in which republican donald trump defeated democrat hillary clinton.

" ukrainian president petro poroshenko told german chancellor angela merkel on friday that he would work to implement a rapid exchange of prisoners held on both sides of the line of conflict in eastern ukraine, a spokesman for merkel said on friday. merkel spoke by telephone with poroshenko on friday, a day after she spoke to russian president vladimir putin, said merkel s deputy spokesman georg streiter. merkel and poroshenko welcomed a decision by the parties to recommit to a ceasefire agreement signed in 2015 ahead of the christmas holiday, and both agreed it should lead to a longer term improvement of the security situation in the region. a russian backed separatist insurgency erupted in 2014 and  bloodshed has continued despite the ceasefire. more than 10,000 people have been killed, with casualties reported on a near daily basis. poroshenko and merkel underscored the importance of an agreement by the parties to exchange prisoners, calling it  an important step toward implementation of the minsk agreements,  streiter said.  president poroshenko stressed that he would push to ensure that this exchange happened as soon as possible,  he added. the two leaders also discussed the withdrawal of russian officers from the joint center for control and coordination that plays an important role in supporting the observer mission of the organisation for security and cooperation in europe. they agreed that the russian officers should return to the center quickly, and said german and french experts could get involved in a mediating role in coming days. merkel also welcomed poroshenko s plan to submit a draft law to set up an independent anti corruption court, the spokesman said.

" president donald trump is unlikely to win congressional support for funds he wants for a proposed u.s. mexico border wall before an oct. 1 deadline, meaning he may have to choose between backing down on a key campaign promise or shutting down the government. the second option was a politically dangerous one before  hurricane harvey tore through southern texas over the weekend and it now looks even riskier. at a campaign style rally in phoenix last week, trump  doubled down on his earlier demands that congress fund a mexican border wall in government spending legislation, adding a clear threat. “if we have to close down our government, we’re building that wall,” he told supporters. since then, lawmakers who were already struggling to hammer out a stop gap federal spending bill before oct. 1 to avoid a shutdown have had to factor in trump’s threat as well. during his election campaign, trump insisted mexico would pay for the construction of the wall, which experts said could cost about $22 billion and take more than three years to complete. with mexico refusing to pay, trump has said since taking office in january that the wall will initially need u.s. funding but that he will find a way to make mexico ultimately pay for it. a government shutdown would result if congress is unable to agree on a spending deal or if trump does not like the package and vetoes it. a veto would put trump in a dangerous position of rejecting a bill approved by his own party. “shutting down the government would be a self destructive act, not to mention an act of political malpractice,” republican representative charlie dent said in an interview. republicans firmly control the house of representatives, but have only a narrow majority in the senate, where at least eight democratic votes will be needed to pass a spending bill. democratic leaders firmly oppose the border wall and appear to be in no mood to do trump a favor by including funding now. “democrats aren’t feeling the heat over this,” democratic strategist jim manley said, adding that “no democrat is going to be cowed” by trump’s threat to shut down the government. without democratic support, current and former congressional aides from both parties said they expected senate republican leader mitch mcconnell, who has been sharply criticized by trump in recent weeks, to opt for a spending bill without wall funding to get legislation to the president’s desk. dent said he expected the senate would “strip out” $1.6 billion that had been set aside to start building the wall in a spending measure already passed by the house, and send it back to that chamber for another vote.  dent voted for the wall funding the first time but said he would approve the spending measure without the wall money if that is what it takes to keep the government open. asked what congress would do if trump vetoes a spending  bill, dent said: “we’ll have to determine what our next steps will be, but i’m hopeful he’ll sign the bill.” short term fix a stop gap spending bill would keep the government open for several months with no major changes to spending programs while lawmakers work out a longer term deal. the u.s. congress has relied heavily on those short term fixes   known as continuing resolutions   for many years. federal assistance for those affected by devastating floods triggered by harvey could be attached to a new continuing resolution.  but trump said on monday the hurricane recovery effort had not caused him to reconsider the option of a government shutdown. “i think it has nothing to do with it, really. i think this is separate,” he said at a news conference. he said he hoped a government shutdown would not be needed but declined to rule it out. “if it’s necessary, we’ll have to see.” if trump signs a short term extension without wall funding, it could delay the battle until december, when that legislation would likely expire. trump also said on monday that the border wall was “imperative” in order to tackle drug trafficking and crime as well as illegal immigration. the budget debate is also complicated by the need to finance support for victims of harvey, the worst storm to hit texas in more than 50 years, and find a deal on increasing the federal debt ceiling, which limits how much money the u.s. government can borrow. one possible escape route for trump could be separate legislation for funding the wall. john cornyn, the no. 2 republican in the senate, has introduced legislation that would authorize $15 billion over four years for border security. that would still need the support of at least eight senate democrats.

" the u.s. embassy to russia said on monday it would restart some visa services in u.s. consulates which it had previously canceled due to diplomatic expulsions that had left it short staffed. the united states began to scale back its visa services in russia in august, drawing an angry reaction from moscow three weeks after president vladimir putin ordered washington to more than halve its embassy and consular staff. the u.s. step meant russian citizens wanting to visit the united states for business, tourism or educational reasons were  no longer able to apply via u.s. consulates outside moscow and had to travel to the russian capital instead. the embassy said in a statement on monday some visa services would resume on dec. 11. “on december 11, the u.s. consulates in st. petersburg, yekaterinburg, and vladivostok will begin to offer limited interviews for non immigrant visas,” it said.

" brazil s supreme court on wednesday decided to grant congress the final word on decisions to remove a sitting politician, conceding a victory to lawmakers fighting to shield themselves from prosecution for corruption. the narrow 6 5 decision will allow the senate to vote next week to revoke a top court ruling that suspended senator aecio neves who is being investigated in seven corruption cases. a majority of the justices decided to back off from confrontation with congress in the midst of brazil s biggest political corruption scandal, which has even implicated president michel temer and his inner circle of cabinet ministers. the lower house of congress is expected to vote later this month to shelve charges against temer in a corruption case involving meatpacker jbs sa, saving him from trial by the supreme court. more than 110 politicians are targeted by the sprawling car wash graft investigation that has uncovered since 2014 a massive network of bribes and kickbacks paid by companies seeking to win government contracts and influence legislation. congress has pushed back against judicial action by the supreme court since the justices ordered the removal of the former speaker of the lower house, eduardo cunha, who was  arrested last year, convicted of corruption and sentenced to more than 15 years in prison for corruption. one third of the politicians in brazil s congress   more than 230   including more than half of its senators, are being investigated for breaking the law and face trial by the supreme court, the only court that can try lawmakers and ministers. those being investigated include the presidents of the senate and the lower house, and many of the leaders of temer s governing coalition. in another gain for the political class, the supreme court ruled on tuesday that no one can be charged merely on the basis of plea bargain testimony by just one witness if no evidence is provided to back up the accusation. plea deals have been the main tool used by anti corruption prosecutors to track the network of political kickbacks and   dismantle graft schemes discovered at oil company petrobras and other state run enterprises. the ruling was part of a decision to throw out corruption and money laundering charges against senator renan calheiros, the former president of the senate who faces seven other graft investigations.

"this is gonna be a tough pill for the left to swallow after working so hard to stack the courts in a victory for the trump administration, the supreme court on monday lifted key components of an injunction against president trump s proposed ban on travel from six majority-muslim nations, reinstating much of the policy and promising to hear full arguments as early as this fall.the court s decision means the justices will now wade into the biggest legal controversy of the trump administration   the president s order temporarily restricting travel, which even trump has termed a  travel ban. today s unanimous supreme court decision is a clear victory for our national security,  trump said in a statement.  as president, i cannot allow people into our country who want to do us harm. i want people who can love the united states and all of its citizens, and who will be hardworking and productive. he added:  my number one responsibility as commander in chief is to keep the american people safe. today s ruling allows me to use an important tool for protecting our nation s homeland. the court made clear that a limited version of the policy can be enforced immediately with a full hearing to come in the fall. an american individual or entity that has a bona fide relationship with a particular person seeking to enter the country as a refugee can legitimately claim concrete hardship if that person is excluded,  the court wrote.  as to these individuals and entities, we do not disturb the injunction. but when it comes to refugees who lack any such connection to the united states, for the reasons we have set out, the balance tips in favor of the government s compelling need to provide for the nation s security. the justices decided to review the broader constitutional issues over executive authority on immigration with oral arguments to be held in the fall.  fox news",1
" syrian army forces backed by iranian backed militias pushed deeper into the last rebel held enclave near a strategic border area with israel and lebanon in a new expansion of tehran s influence in the war torn country. the army and the shi ite forces helped by druze militias in the area advanced east and south of the sunni rebel held bastion of beit jin backed by some of the heaviest aerial bombing and artillery shelling since a major assault began more than two months ago to seize the area, rebels said. the syrian army said it had encircled the village of mughr al meer at the foothills of mount hermon as troops moved toward beit jin amid fierce clashes. on monday, the army said they had cut off insurgent supply lines and made further advances.  the enclave is the last rebel bastion left in the southwest of damascus known as the western ghouta that had since last year fallen under government control after months of heavy bombing on civilian areas and years of siege tactics that forced rebels to surrender. a western intelligence source confirmed rebel reports that iranian backed local militias alongside commanders from the powerful lebanese hezbollah shi ite group were playing a major role in the ongoing battles. tehran was pushing to establish a strategic presence along the israeli border in the syrian golan heights, the source said.  rebels said they had repelled several attempts to storm their defenses and denied reports they were about to surrender.  the iranian backed militias are trying to consolidate their sphere of influence all the way from southwest of damascus to the israeli border,  said suhaib al ruhail, an official from the liwa al furqan rebel group that operates in the area. worried by iran s expanding influence in syria after the defeat of islamic state, israel has in recent weeks stepped up its strikes against suspected iranian targets inside syria. early this month there was an israeli strike on a base near kiswah, south of damascus, that was widely believed to be an iranian military compound, a western intelligence source said. israel has been lobbying washington and moscow to deny iran, lebanon s hezbollah and other shi ite militias any permanent bases in syria, and to keep them away from the golan, as they gain ground while helping damascus beat back sunni led rebels. the southwest of syria is part of a de escalation zone in southern syria agreed last july between russia and the united states, the first such understanding between the two powers. the area has not seen russian bombing, unlike other ceasefire areas in syria. diplomatic sources say several thousand shi ite and druze fighters are pitted against hundreds of sunni jihadists and mainstream free syria army (fsa) rebels closing ranks under the banner of itihad quwt jabal al sheikh, or  union of fighters of jabal al sheikh . they are mainly drawn from local fighters from the area. with the army and iranian backed offensive widening, the sunni rebels have called on youths to enlist, while mosque imams in beit jin called on people to take up arms and fight the army. rebels still have a sizeable presence in central and southern quneitra, in the syrian golan heights. western diplomatic sources say the crushing of the sunni rebel presence in areas they have been in since 2013 will allow lebanon s hezbollah to open another secure arms supply line from its border in southern lebanon into syria. since the beginning of the conflict in syria, iran has had a growing presence in the country, deploying thousands of shi ite fighters drawn from iraq and afghanistan who have fought against both mainstream sunni rebel groups and more militant groups.

" democratic senator elizabeth warren is taking aim at budget chief mick mulvaney’s plan to fill the ranks of the u.s. consumer financial watchdog with political allies, according to letters seen by reuters, the latest salvo in a broader battle over who should run the bureau. president donald trump last month appointed mulvaney as acting director of the consumer financial protection bureau (cfpb), though the decision is being legally challenged by the agency’s deputy director, leandra english, who says she is the rightful interim head. mulvaney told reporters earlier this month he planned to bring in several political appointees to help overhaul the agency, but warren warned in a pair of letters sent monday to mulvaney and the office of personnel management (opm), which oversees federal hiring, that doing so was inappropriate and potentially illegal. the cfpb is meant to be an independent agency staffed primarily by non political employees. hiring political appointees could violate civil service laws designed to protect such employees from undue political pressure and discrimination, warren said. “your naked effort to politicize the consumer agency runs counter to the agency’s mission to be an independent voice for consumers with the power to stand up to wall street banks,” warren, who helped create the cfpb, wrote to mulvaney. in a separate letter, warren asked the opm to review mulvaney’s “unprecedented and unjustified” plans. in a third letter sent to mulvaney and english, warren asked for information about a review of ongoing enforcement actions at the cfpb. reuters reported earlier this month that a potential multimillion dollar settlement with wells fargo is among the enforcement actions under review amid the change in cfpb leadership. spokespeople for mulvaney and the opm did not immediately respond to requests for comment. mulvaney, who also serves directly under trump as the head of his office of management and budget (omb), said in the long term he would like to see professional staff alongisde political appointees, mirroring an arrangement in place at the omb.  “we will be staffing up with more permanent political people so the professional staff here have a better feel for where the administration wants to take the bureau,” mulvaney said.  but warren said such an arrangement, though understandable for bureaus like the omb which sit directly beneath the white house, was not suitable for independent financial regulators. the leadership of the cfpb has been in question since the agency’s first director, richard cordray, resigned in november.

" u.s. secretary of state rex tillerson called for unity and understanding on his first day at the state department amid internal dissent over policies of president donald trump, which have also antagonized a range of allies. within hours of starting the job, tillerson reached out by phone to counterparts from mexico and canada, spoke by phone with israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu and met with german foreign minister sigmar gabriel, department officials said. hundreds of state department officials greeted the former exxon mobil corp (xom.n) chief executive with applause as he entered the building. louder cheers broke out when tillerson thanked acting secretary of state tom shannon for standing in after the departure of john kerry. “hi, i’m the new guy,” said tillerson, who was sworn in on wednesday after the senate confirmed him to his post despite concerns about his ties with russia. trump has called for closer relations with russian president vladimir putin. in remarks that did not touch on foreign policy specifics, tillerson addressed the dissent within the department that emerged this week in a memo signed by more than 900 officials in protest against trump’s decision to suspend the u.s. refugee program and restrict travelers from seven muslim majority countries. “one of the great challenges and thrills for the state department staff is deciding how to confront changing conditions in every corner of the world,” said tillerson, “i encourage all of you to use your natural and well developed skills to adapt to changes here at home as well. “i know this was a hotly contested election and we do not all feel the same way about the outcome,” said tillerson. “each of us is entitled to expression of our political beliefs, but we cannot let our personal convictions overwhelm our ability to work as one team.” he also signaled he would impose changes to improve the functioning of the department and said the security of diplomats was a priority. there was no readout after his meeting with gabriel at the state department, although discussions were likely focused on the nato alliance, the future of the iran nuclear agreement and trade.  his separate phone calls with foreign ministers from canada and mexico coincided with trump saying on thursday he wanted early talks on the north american free trade agreement, which he wants to renegotiate or repeal. “i know him and we are very excited having the opportunity to work with him,” mexican foreign minister luis videgaray said in an interview on cnn on thursday evening, adding that he would meet tillerson shortly. the two met a couple of times when videgaray was finance minister and tillerson at exxon, he said. tillerson also spoke by phone with netanyahu, the state department said in a statement. it did not say whether they discussed a white house statement that said israeli settlements in occupied territories may not be helpful in achieving peace with palestinians, adopting a more measured tone than its previous pro israel announcements. “in all of his conversations, secretary tillerson stressed america’s steadfast commitment to its key allies and partners as it works to protect the interests and safety of the american people,” acting state department spokesman mark toner said in a statement. tillerson inherits a messy globe, with war in syria and iraq, nuclear armed north korea threatening to launch an intercontinental ballistic missile, and increased violence in eastern ukraine. over the past 48 hours, more foreign policy challenges piled up as tensions erupted between the united states and ally australia over an existing refugee swap, which trump called a “dumb deal.” strains with iran also increased after the white house said it was putting tehran on notice for test firing a ballistic missile and the new administration moved to impose sanctions on several iranian entities on friday, according to sources familiar with the matter.

" the u.s. house of representatives voted down on monday a measure that would have compelled cell phone carriers to disclose a phone’s location with law enforcement in the event of an emergency, amid a last minute lobbying effort from privacy advocates opposed to it. lawmakers voted 229 158 to pass the kelsey smith act, falling short of the two thirds threshold necessary due to rules invoked to expedite the bill’s vote. the rejection was considered surprising, as house leadership rarely schedules a vote on legislation it is not confident will pass. however, civil liberties groups aggressively opposed the bill on monday, arguing that while well intended, it would create a warrant loophole and could lead to expanded government surveillance.  r street, a libertarian leaning think tank, said phone companies already possess the authority to share cell phone location data in emergency situations and did so frequently, making the legislation largely unnecessary. the bill is named after a deceased 18 year old kansas woman who disappeared following a visit to a local target store in 2007. smith was found murdered four days later only after verizon, her cell phone provider, shared the location of her phone with authorities, according to representative kevin yoder, a kansas republican and author of the bill. “while i’m disappointed in tonight’s outcome, i look forward to the bill being brought back to the house floor when a simple majority vote can get it passed.” yoder said in a statement. smith’s parents were in attendance in the house chamber during the vote, according to yoder’s office. more than 20 states have already adopted versions of the law since smith’s death.

" libya put 142 illegal migrants on a flight back to guinea on wednesday with the help of the u.n. migration agency, officials said, as the north african country steps up deportations to ease severe overcrowding in its detention centers. the number of people stuck in libyan detention centers has risen dramatically this year after armed groups largely shut down the boat route to italy from the smuggling hub of sabratha. the international organization for migration flew the guinean migrants from two western cities to the city of misrata, from where they boarded a plane for conakry. the deportations come in the wake of a cnn report on migrants being sold for slave labor that sparked an international outcry. migrant flows through libya have surged since 2014. more than 600,000 people have crossed the central mediterranean to italy in the past three years, but departures from libya s coast dropped sharply in july when armed groups in sabratha began preventing boats from leaving. after clashes in the western city in september, thousands of migrants held near the coast emerged and were transferred to detention centers under the nominal control of the u.n. backed government in tripoli. amnesty international said this month that up to 20,000 people are being held in detention centers and are subject to  torture, forced labor, extortion, and unlawful killings . other human rights organizations have said similar things in recent months.

" vanguard group chief executive bill mcnabb said on thursday he was encouraged by the u.s. department of labor’s steps to make new rules on the advice brokers provide on retirement savings “more workable.” “we are encouraged that the dol has taken important steps to establish meaningful protections for retirement investors while making the final rule more workable,” mcnabb said in a statement posted online. the obama administration on wednesday unveiled its final version of a retirement advice rule aimed at ensuring that broker dealers put their clients’ interests ahead of their own profits, though it was softened in response to industry complaints. vanguard, a major manager of retirement investments that oversees more than $3 trillion in assets, had criticized an earlier version of the proposal as being applied too broadly to its activities and to situations in which investors would not reasonably expect that they were receiving investment advice. yet vanguard said the new rule makes disclosure and contract requirements “more practical and easier to follow.” “all of the effort within the industry to improve the dol proposal appears to have produced positive results,” according to john schadl, a member of the company’s legal department, according to a statement also posted online. the company praised the government’s efforts to align its rules better with existing standards laid out by other regulatory bodies, although vanguard said “the dol could have done more to harmonize these standards.” the valley forge, pennsylvania based company said it has not fully reviewed the 1,023 pages of rules the department released. “it is almost certain that we will find provisions of the new rule that will adversely affect some within the industry,” schadl said in the statement.

" sweden said on tuesday it was stopping new aid for cambodia, except in education and research, and would no longer support a reform programme after the main opposition party was outlawed by the supreme court at the government s request. the announcement marked the first concrete action by a european union country in protest at a political crackdown in which veteran prime minister hun sen s main rival has also been arrested and civil rights groups and independent media attacked. the united states cut election funding and said it would take more punitive steps after last week s ban on the cambodia national rescue party (cnrp). the european union has also threatened action. sweden s embassy in phnom penh said the country was reviewing its engagement with cambodia.   we will not initiate any new government to government development cooperation agreements, except in the areas of education and research,  it said in a statement. as a consequence, it would be unable to support decentralisation reform in its current form. that reform aims to strengthen lower levels of government, such as local communes. the cnrp won control of more than 40 percent of the communes in elections in june, but has now had to give them up to the ruling cambodian people s party (cpp). the cnrp was banned after its leader, kem sokha, was arrested for alleged treason. the government says he sought to take power with american help. he rejects that allegation as politically motivated, to allow hun sen to extend his more than three decades in power in next year s general election. responding to the swedish statement, a senior official said cambodia welcomed friendship with sweden or other countries, but said they must understand the cnrp had been banned because the courts found it had committed treason.      people should respect the cambodian people s decision in accordance with the principle of democracy and the rule of law,  said huy vannak, undersecretary of state at the interior ministry. sweden, which has given cambodia an estimated $100 million in aid over five years, ranked third among individual eu member states in cambodia s database of donors last year, after france and germany. swedish fashion group h&m is also a key buyer from cambodia s garment factories   the country s main export earner. but western donors have less sway than they once did since china has emerged as cambodia s biggest aid donor and investor. meeting on monday on the sidelines of a meeting of asia europe foreign ministers in myanmar, chinese foreign minister wang yi told his cambodian counterpart prak sokhon that china supported the government s actions. china has repeatedly expressed its support for cambodia, making no criticism of the government led by hun sen, a former khmer rouge commander, who is one of beijing s most important allies in southeast asia.

" the egyptian public prosecutor ordered that a suspected libyan militant and 14 others be held for 15 days pending an investigation of their role in a deadly attack in egypt s western desert last month, state news mena reported on friday. the interior ministry said on thursday that abdelrahim mohamed al mesmari, from the libyan city of derna, was captured by egyptian forces following an air raid in response to the attack. security sources initially said at least 52 policemen were killed when militants attacked a patrol, firing rockets and detonating explosives in a remote part of the desert. the interior ministry refuted those figures and said 16 were killed. charges against mesmari will include premeditated murder of police officers, possession of firearms and joining a terrorist organization, mena reported.    a new and little known group called ansar al islam claimed responsibility for the october attack, posing a new threat to egyptian security forces, which have been battling an islamic state insurgency in the sinai peninsula since 2013. the military last month killed 15 militants in an air raid directed at the group it blamed for the desert attack, according to the interior ministry, which said that all of those killed had been trained in derna.  mesmari escaped the air raid but was later arrested along with 29 egyptians who had been recruited to join the group, according to the interior ministry.

" israel said on thursday it had thwarted a plan by two israeli arabs with islamic state sympathies to mount an attack at a contested jerusalem holy site where a july gun ambush set off a wave of violence.  the shin bet security service described the suspects, aged 26 and 16, as residents of the same israeli arab town as three gunmen who on july 14 killed two police guards at a gate to al aqsa mosque compound and were then shot dead.  israel responded to that attack by briefly installing metal detectors outside the compound, angering palestinians who saw that as a breach of decades old access arrangements. four palestinians were killed during ensuing confrontations with israeli security forces and a palestinian stabbed three israeli settlers to death.   the two suspects taken into custody this month  support the islamic state terrorist group s murderous ideology and the terrorist attack was meant to be carried out in expression of this , the shin bet said in its statement on thursday. it said they had two pistols.  they planned a gun attack at the temple mount in jerusalem similar to what transpired on july 14,  it said without elaborating. jews revere the site, where al aqsa mosque and the golden dome of the rock now stand, as the location of their two ancient temples. attempts by jews to pray there, in violation of access arrangements, have been a source of tension with muslims. israel captured east jerusalem, including the old city and the holy compound, in the 1967 middle east war. it annexed the area in a move that has never been recognized internationally.

" the leader of the new zealand first party, which emerged as the kingmaker after an inconclusive weekend election, said on wednesday he would not make a decision on who should form government until after the oct. 7 release of a final count. still to be counted are  special votes , ballots from overseas voters and those who vote outside their home constituencies, which account for 15 percent of total votes. while they are not expected to change the result, with the ruling national party ahead with a comfortable 10 point lead, they could add seats to the possible labour green coalition, making new zealand first more comfortable to go with them, despite the fact they did not win the largest number of seats.  i can t with any intelligence   and nor can my colleagues  tell you what we re going to do until we ve seen all the facts,  winston peters, the outspoken leader of the new zealand first party, told a press conference in wellington. peters, who spoke after meeting with his caucus, gave little away on what his party will demand in return for supporting prime minister bill english or opposition labour leader ardern to form a coalition government. negotiations are expected to take weeks, with those who have worked with peters saying the final decision will be his.  nobody knows what winston peters or nz first will do, at this stage they don t know what they ll do,  tau henare, a former lawmaker for both nz first and national, tweeted on wednesday.  but when winston finds out, they ll know.  the 72 year old peters, a colorful populist and former foreign minister, has served in both national and labour governments in the past. the national party secured 58 seats, ahead of the 52 won by the green party and labour in saturday s election, leaving both still in need of nz first s nine seats to reach the tally of 61 required to form a government. both parties have indicated in recent days that they are willing to offer the carrot of the deputy leadership to peters.  an alternative option, and one that peters took in 2005, was to strike a confidence and supply deal, in which new zealand  first would vote in favor of a governing party s important legislation, like the budget, but remain outside cabinet. on paper, peters has more in common with labour policies,   including curbing immigration, and those who know him say that he d find the option of serving as a high ranking cabinet member to a relative political newcomer like 37 year old ardern an attractive proposition. he has also been scathing of english s performance as leader. but peters also has a track record of siding with the party that wins the most votes in an election, and is less than complimentary about labour s minority partner, the green party.  everything is negotiable,  said nz first mp tracey martin.  it depends how flexible the national party wants to be, i suppose.  peters has been in parliament since 1978 and was a member of the national party until he formed new zealand first in 1993. he was first cast as kingmaker in 1996, when he famously put off coalition talks the day after the election to go fishing.

" president donald trump on wednesday moved a step closer to fulfilling his campaign promise to reform the troubled veterans affairs department, but some veterans groups are concerned that the administration may be working toward privatizing their healthcare. trump signed a law extending the pilot “veterans choice” program, which allows some veterans to receive healthcare from local doctors and hospitals closer to their homes than the va’s 150 hospitals and nearly 1,000 outpatient clinics. the law eases procedures for reimbursing private providers and creates a system for sharing medical records with them. “this new law is a good start, but there is still much work to do,” trump said at a signing ceremony attended by va secretary david shulkin and florida governor rick scott.  “we will fight each and every day to deliver the long awaited reforms our veterans deserve.” trump pledged to hold a news conference next week on “all of the tremendous things that are happening at the va and what we’ve done in terms of progress and achievement.” reforming the agency, rocked by a waiting time scandal in 2014, was one of trump’s most repeated campaign trail promises. he has frequently suggested having the government pay outside physicians to provide veteran healthcare. during his confirmation hearings, shulkin said he supported overhauling the agency but did not believe in privatizing it. still, on tuesday the va announced it was seeking cutting edge treatments from the healthcare industry for brain injuries, mental health problems and chronic pain. extension of the “veterans choice” program could worry democrats and other critics that trump and shulkin are inching toward sending some of the $65.6 billion the department spends annually on medical care to corporations and private businesses. conservatives calling for privatization say the va provides medical services to only about 45 percent of veterans, and they point to delays and inefficiencies dogging the current system.  some veterans groups and democrats have warned against moving funds away from healthcare providers with expertise in injuries and illnesses unique to serving in the armed forces. in a march report, the government accountability office said veterans in the choice program still face long wait times, mostly because cases must be referred to private contractors for scheduling.  last year a congressionally mandated panel of experts found the choice program was inefficient, but recommended establishing a community based healthcare system that would include private doctors.

" republican lawmakers in kentucky passed a bill on saturday making it the 27th u.s. state to allow workers the right to work in union represented shops and receive union negotiated benefits without paying dues to the representing body.  republican lawmakers in a handful of states have passed similar so called “right to work” and anti union laws in recent years. supporters say the measures spur economic growth while opponents cast the laws as assaults on organized labor and blue collar workers that limit union revenues. the effort to pass the legislation in kentucky came two months after republicans won control of the state’s general assembly for the first time since 1921. republicans now control both chambers in the state’s legislature and the governor’s office.  a kentucky senate committee on friday passed the “right to work” bill, sending it to the full senate, which passed it during a rare saturday session.  “i personally have no problem with an individual opting to be part of a labor union ... but government shouldn’t stand in the way of someone who opts not to join a union,” said speaker of the house jeff hoover in a statement earlier this week. it is widely expected that republican governor matt bevin will sign the bill into law in the coming days. if so, kentucky will immediately become the 27th state and last southern state to enact “right to work” legislation. the state senate also passed an ultrasound abortion bill that was approved by the house on thursday. supporters of the “right to work” measure say it will make kentucky more competitive with neighboring states with similar laws in attracting new business. kentucky has been unable to pass “right to work” legislation in the past because of its strong union ties across the state, labor leaders said. the republican led state senate had passed similar bills in recent years, but house democrats refused to hear the bills. “the future of the fight is in, as best we can, trying to stop the erosion of wages, benefits and safety,” said caitlin lally, a spokeswoman for the united food and commercial workers local 227 in louisville and vice president of the greater louisville central labor council. hundreds of democrats heeded their party leaders’ call for a protest and packed the capitol rotunda in frankfort on saturday.  “politicians didn’t create the labor movement, and politicians won’t destroy the labor movement,” said delane adams, spokesman for the afl cio southern regional office.

" after taiwan s state run mega financial holding co was fined $180 million by u.s. authorities for lax enforcement of anti money laundering rules at its new york branch, the bank started a rigorous training program for its staff. now, like mega financial, companies across taiwan are working to get staff and systems up to speed after the island passed laws to meet international standards on combating money laundering and was taken off a watchlist by the asia pacific group on money laundering (apg).  unfortunately, taiwan has earned a name for itself as a paradise for money laundering,  deputy justice minister tsai pi chung told reuters. money laundering and cybercrime connections to taiwan, which is also in the process of pushing through a cyber security bill, have grabbed global headlines. u.s. authorities fined mega financial $180 million last year for lax enforcement of anti money laundering rules at its new york branch. some money from the $170 million cyber heist of india s union bank of india was transferred through taiwan s bank sinopac. an international crime ring used malware to steal $2.6 million from the atms of taiwan s first bank. taiwan was one of the six most targeted countries of the wannacry ransomware attack earlier this year, according to security company avast.  since 2011, 800 people from china and taiwan have been deported from cambodia on suspicion of telecoms fraud. following its u.s. fine, mega financial said cleaning up its act is a top priority. u.s. authorities had said the mega branch had been  indifferent  to the risks associated with transactions involving panama, a high risk area for money laundering.  what happened at our new york branch was just terrible,  said robert tsai, a senior executive vice president, referring to the fine and ensuing scandal.  half of our 6,000 clerks have been certified with anti money laundering training. how each of our branches implements the rules and ensures proper training is the top priority for our business.  to gain international confidence in its anti money laundering measures, taiwan will have to demonstrate it is putting the laws into practice. the apg will review taiwan in 2018.  the visit will focus on how effectively taiwan will have actually implemented the anti money laundering rules,  said liang hung lieh, partner of pricewaterhousecoopers taiwan.  the apg s on site review will be new to most of the assessed, including banks, non bank financial institutions and in particular non financial institutions such as lawyers, public certified accountants and other professional service providers.  under the anti money laundering laws, these financial professionals will be required to report suspicious transactions, including bank transfers exceeding t$500,000 (us$16,500). they will have to determine where the money came from, provide details about the client and report that to taiwan s newly established anti money laundering office. these are similar to regulations that countries that have signed up to global anti money laundering rules overseen by the financial action task force (fatf) have adopted. the cost to companies of implementing the new rules may be significant as they put processes, workers and data systems in place.  there s a lot of extra work for them to do now, such as determining the identities of their clients  beneficiaries,  said an official with the financial supervisory commission, the island s financial regulator. he declined to be identified in the absence of permission to speak to the media.  they don t yet know exactly what they have to do, and to what extent, to be considered compliant with the new regulations. they re going to need some time to digest all of these new rules,  he said. the potential costs and increased difficulty of getting transactions done under the new rules worry those in the property market, said wong jui chi, the spokesman for taiwan s chinese association of real estate brokers, while emphasizing that his industry intends to fully comply with the regulations.  the property market is already in a bad shape and these new rules will make things worse by making the process of real estate transactions more complicated. more or less everyone in our industry is complaining about it,  he said.

" u.s. republican presidential candidate donald trump has fired his national political director after six weeks on the job, campaign sources said on wednesday. trump told staffers and supporters gathered backstage before a campaign rally in california on wednesday that political director rick wiley “should be fired” for his handling of a fundraising deal with the republican national committee, according to the sources.  the rnc fundraising agreement included 11 states but not nevada, where republicans in the state are angling for key victories in the november elections. three sources confirmed trump said wiley should be fired after nevada republican party chairman michael mcdonald told trump that wiley was responsible for leaving nevada out of the deal. mcdonald did not return calls seeking comment. wiley did not respond to emails, text messages and phone calls seeking comment. the move is the latest in a tug of war between trump’s original campaign team, including press secretary hope hicks and  campaign manager corey lewandowski, and a group of professionals he brought in later to shore up support from more traditional corners of the republican party. the new arrivals, led by veteran strategist paul manafort, whom trump hired in late march, have urged trump to tone down some of his most provocative positions, such as his proposed ban on muslims entering the united states. but trump reprimanded manafort, according to two sources familiar with the conversation, after manafort told a gathering of rnc members at an april meeting in florida that trump was only “acting” when describing his proposed muslim ban or his plan to build a wall along the u.s. mexico border. manafort hired wiley on april 13. a statement issued by the trump campaign said wiley had been hired on a “short term basis as a consultant until the campaign was running full steam” and it thanked him for “for helping us during this transition period.” manafort did not responds to calls and emails seeking comment.

" u.s. president donald trump has designated white house budget director mick mulvaney acting director of the consumer financial protection bureau until a permanent director is nominated and confirmed, the white house said on friday. the action came hours after richard cordray submitted his formal resignation and named a deputy director as his replacement, setting the stage for a political and legal battle over the regulator’s leadership. “the president looks forward to seeing director mulvaney take a common sense approach to leading the cfpb’s dedicated staff, an approach that will empower consumers to make their own financial decisions and facilitate investment in our communities,” the white house said in its statement. democratic lawmakers are eager to preserve the regulator for as long as possible while republicans want to put in place new leadership to chart a drastically different course.  the six year old bureau has policed consumer financial markets, drafting aggressive rules curbing products like payday loans, while issuing multimillion dollar fines against large financial institutions like wells fargo. but republicans have consistently complained the agency is too powerful and lacks oversight from congress on its operations, and they are eager to take control. mulvaney, who has criticized the bureau in the past, said, “i look forward to working with the expert personnel within the agency to identify how the bureau can transition to be more effective in its mission, while becoming more accountable to the taxpayer.” the succession plan has never been tested, with cordray as its first and only full time director. cordray had previously announced plans to resign by the end of november. in a statement to staff, he said that leandra english, the cfpb’s chief of staff, had been named deputy director and would take over as acting director of the agency upon his exit. however, the white house had already said it planned to name its own interim leadership at the regulator. trump has pushed to ease regulations on businesses, including the financial sector, a stance seemingly at odds with cordray’s more aggressive regulatory approach. earlier this month, white house deputy press secretary raj shah said that the administration “will announce an acting director and the president’s choice to replace mr cordray at the appropriate time.” there are competing theories in washington as to who can name cordray’s replacement. democrats point to language in the dodd frank law that created the cfpb, stipulating the deputy director replaces the director when he or she leaves. but others say a separate law governing federal vacancies gives trump power to name someone elsewhere in the administration to that role temporarily, while the white house identifies a full time nominee who would be confirmed by the senate.

" exxon mobil corp chief executive officer rex tillerson emerged on friday as president elect donald trump’s leading candidate for u.s. secretary of state, a senior transition official said. trump met tillerson on tuesday and may talk to him again over the weekend, the official said. trump appears to be in the final days of deliberations over his top diplomat with an announcement possible next week. tillerson’s favored status was revealed as former new york mayor rudy giuliani formally withdrew from consideration for secretary of state. the transition official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said tillerson, 64, had moved ahead in trump’s deliberations over 2012 republican presidential nominee mitt romney, who has met trump twice, including at a dinner in new york. but the official said romney was still under consideration for the job, along with john bolton, a former u.s. ambassador to the united nations; u.s. senator bob corker of tennessee, and retired navy admiral james stavridis. giuliani’s withdrawal came after he was fully vetted by the trump transition team for his overseas business ties in what was described by the trump official as an “intense” effort by lawyers and accountants.  giuliani, who runs a global consulting firm, was given a clean bill of health, with trump’s aides concluding his business interests would not pose a risk to his confirmation. should tillerson be nominated, his business ties, too, will come under scrutiny. exxon mobil has operations in more than 50 countries and boasts that it explores for oil and natural gas on six continents. in 2011, exxon mobil signed a deal with rosneft, russia’s largest state owned oil company, for joint oil exploration and production. since then, the companies have formed 10 joint ventures for projects in russia.  in 2013, russian president vladimir putin awarded tillerson his nation’s order of friendship. but u.s. sanctions against russia for its incursion into crimea cost exxon mobil dearly, forcing it to scrap some projects and costing it at least $1 billion in losses. tillerson has been a vocal critic of the sanctions.  trump has spoken of wanting warmer relations with moscow, which has sparked concerns in congress that he could lift or loosen some of the sanctions on russia.  tillerson has been chairman and ceo of exxon mobil since 2006. he is expected to retire from the company next year.  should tillerson be nominated, climate change could be another divisive issue. the company is under investigation by the new york attorney general’s office for allegedly misleading investors, regulators and the public on what it knew about global warming.

" somali security forces have arrested a former minister and outspoken government critic after clashing with his bodyguards during an overnight raid on his home, the security ministry said on monday. abdirahman abdishakur was a candidate in a february election won by president mohamed abdullahi mohamed whose united nations backed government faces growing pressure over its failure to put an end to an islamist militant insurgency. abdishakur was arrested for treason, a spokesman for the internal security ministry abdiasis ali told reporters at a news conference, without giving more details.  he also declined to comment on reports that five bodyguards were killed and that abdishakur had  been lightly injured during the raid.  the former minister was legally arrested by decree from the attorney general and internal security minister. he was accused of treason. his guards fought the security forces,  he said. a policeman and a local elder told reuters earlier that five bodyguards were killed during the raid. the elder, abdullahi ali, also said abdishakur had been injured on the arm by a stray bullet.   at the same news conference on monday, attorney general ahmed ali dahir described abdishakur s house as a hub for the opposition and a gathering point for people  who want to collapse the government.   we also warn those who meet at hotels,  he added. many somali officials including lawmakers live in fortified hotels for the security they offer. before sunday s raid dahir had accused two other lawmakers of treason, prompting abdishakur to post an angry response on facebook.   let lawmakers be strangled, let their immunity be removed: this is a hopeless attack which portrays despair.  the raid drew condemnation from other politicians.   what the government is doing is against islam and healthy politics,  lawmaker mahad salad told reuters.  we condemn the government s immoral act. we also order for the release of the ex minister.  the presidential election in february was praised by western aid donors as a modest step forward from the previous election but the insurgency is striking with ever larger and more deadly attacks in the capital and major towns.  more than 500 people were killed in twin bomb blasts in mogadishu in october. last week a suicide bomber killed at least 18 people at a mogadishu police academy.  the government is also struggling under political infighting and a very weak central state. reuters reported last week that the united states is suspending food and fuel aid for most of somalia s armed forces over corruption concerns, a blow to the military as african peacekeepers start to withdraw this month.

" a suicide bomber killed at least 50 people in northeastern nigeria on tuesday in an attack on a mosque which bore the hallmarks of a faction of the islamist militant group boko haram. the bombing in mubi in adamawa state was one of the deadliest in nigeria s northeast since president muhammadu buhari came to power in 2015 pledging to end boko haram s eight year insurgency and attacks by the group on civilian and military targets. it brought to at least 278 the number of people killed in 2017, according to calculations by reuters. there was no claim of responsibility.  some of the dead were in pieces beyond recognition,  said bayi muhammad, a worshipper who escaped the blast because he was late for early morning prayers. abubakar othman, a police spokesman in adamawa state, said the death toll was at least 50, but added that the tally could rise. eight people were critically injured and more than 30 others hurt but in stable condition, said idris garga, the northeast regional coordinator for nigeria s national emergency agency. boko haram held territory in adamawa state in 2014. troops pushed them out in early 2015, and the town of mubi had itself been relatively peaceful until tuesday s bombing. in a statement on tuesday, nigeria s president said the attack was  very cruel  and gave assurances his government would do  everything required  to secure the state from boko haram.  the militant group often mounts suicide attacks in public places such as mosques and markets. last december, two schoolgirl suicide bombers killed 56 people and wounded dozens more at a market in adamawa. the mosque blast bears the hallmarks of a faction led by abubakar shekau, which forces women and girls to carry out suicide bombings. the attacks often leave only the bomber dead. boko haram has waged an insurgency in northeastern nigeria since 2009 in its attempt to create an islamic state in the region. it has killed more than 20,000 and forced around 2 million people to flee their homes.  the group split in 2016 and the faction under shekau is based in the sambisa forest on the border with cameroon and chad and mainly targets civilians with suicide bombers. the other faction is based in the lake chad region and led by abu musab al barnawi. it mainly attacks military forces after quietly building up its strength over the past year. most attacks focus on borno state, the birthplace of the insurgency. the group held land around the size of belgium in borno, adamawa and yobe states until early 2015 but was forced out by nigeria s army and troops from neighboring countries.

" vice president joe biden on thursday called on the republican led u.s. congress to allow an up or down vote on funding to combat the zika virus without other provisions attached, calling the health threat posed by the pathogen a national emergency. congress has failed to approve any funding to fight the mosquito borne virus since president barack obama asked for $1.9 billion in february.  lawmakers have been deadlocked for months over a $1.1 billion funding bill. democrats have accused republicans of attaching controversial provisions related to abortion that they cannot accept. republicans have accused democrats of blocking the bill to gain political advantage by portraying republicans as obstructionists on zika funding. “give us an up or down vote, straight, on zika,” biden said at an event on capitol hill with fellow democrats from the senate and house of representatives. “i understand attaching controversial issues to important legislation ... but this is a national emergency,” biden added. “people’s health, the well being of unborn children, the health of the country at large, is at stake. act.” u.s. health officials have concluded that zika infections in pregnant women can cause microcephaly, a birth defect marked by small head size that can lead to severe developmental problems in babies. there is no vaccine or treatment for zika. two top federal health officials also visited congress on thursday to underscore the importance of zika funding. “we’re all hopeful that the congress will come through with the money that’s needed to respond effectively to zika,” dr. tom frieden, director of the centers for disease control and prevention, told reporters after meeting with senate democratic leaders alongside dr. anthony fauci, director of the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases. house democratic leader nancy pelosi told reporters that democrats want zika funding added to stop gap legislation that congress must pass by oct. 1 to keep federal agencies operating.  “by zika, i mean for a year. i don’t mean for three months,” pelosi said. “zika should be emergency spending. it should not be off set (requiring cuts in other government programs), because it is an emergency.”  a main issue is democrats’ opposition to language, backed by republicans, that they say would prevent zika funds for abortion providers like planned parenthood, mainly in puerto rico. the virus, first detected in brazil last year, has spread rapidly through the americas. florida is the only u.s. state so far where local mosquitoes are known to be transmitting zika.

" u.s. president barack obama on friday said the united states remains committed to bringing home americans held captive overseas and helping their families, a year after the administration promised to overhaul its handling of hostage situations. “we will not stop until we can bring our fellow citizens back to their families,” obama said in a statement on the anniversary of the white house’s policy review. obama specifically named journalist austin tice who disappeared in syria in 2012, caitlan coleman held in afghanistan, and retired fbi agent robert levinson, who went missing in iran more than nine years ago. earlier this week, the families of four americans killed by islamic state urged obama to do everything possible to bring home tice, the only u.s. journalist known to be held in war torn syria. the parents of the slain hostages criticized obama for not personally naming tice in his remarks at this year’s white house correspondents’ association dinner when obama said that he would “fight for the release of american hostages held against their will.”  they said tice’s return would be a test of the of the success of the administration’s new policy. the white house undertook a six month review of its hostage policies after complaints from families that their initiatives to free relatives captured abroad had been discouraged and sometimes blocked by government officials. as part of the overhaul, obama named james o’brien special presidential envoy for hostage affairs at the state department to help coordinate the efforts of law enforcement and diplomats. “but i know our work will not be done until our fellow americans who are held against their will, and whose families mark their calendars by the days since they’ve held their loved ones, are reunited,” obama said.

" south korean police have arrested the owner and the manager of a building where 29 people died in a fire last week, accusing the pair of multiple safety lapses, including blocked exits and malfunctioning sprinkler systems. on thursday, a fire ripped through an eight story high rise in the small city of jecheon. at least 20 of the victims were women who were overcome by toxic fumes in a second floor sauna. jecheon police have only identified the owner by his last name of lee, and the manager by his last name of kim. both men are in custody in jecheon after being arrested on sunday, police announced on tuesday. lee faces two charges of violating fire safety regulations and committing involuntary homicide by professional negligence, while kim also faces the involuntary homicide charge. if convicted of involuntary homicide, lee and kim could face up to five years in prison or 20 million won ($16,000) in fines.   the sprinkler system on the building s first floor did not work properly when the fire erupted,  a police detective, who asked not to be named as he was not authorized to speak on an ongoing investigation, told reuters.  if the sprinkler system worked, the fire probably would not have spread as fast as it did.  police said on tuesday that lee has retained a lawyer but declined to name the lawyer or firm. police said kim has not yet hired a lawyer. photos released by the yonhap news agency showed a smoke stained stairwell and a fire exit filled with shelves and supplies on the second floor, where most of the deaths occurred.  the emergency exit on the building s second floor was blocked by iron shelves and other miscellaneous items,  the detective confirmed. officials are still investigating the cause of the conflagration. according to police, both kim and lee had denied reports they were trying to remove ice on the ceiling of the first floor, where the fire appeared to have originated, but later changed their statements after police confronted them with evidence. the korea joongang daily newspaper reported on tuesday that lee had at one point told police he did not alert the women in the sauna because they were undressed, however, the police detective told reuters he could not confirm that as investigations were ongoing. anger mounted over the weekend at reports of shoddy construction, broken doors, blocked roads and other problems that may have contributed to the deaths. a number of cars parked along the narrow roads around the building impeded the ability of firefighters to reach the fire, an official with the jecheon fire department told reuters, but noted that none of the parked vehicles appeared to have violated parking rules.  although vehicles can park there legally, it was quite difficult for fire trucks to go through to get to the scene, because the road was too narrow,  said the fire official, who declined to be named as he was not authorized to speak publicly. visiting the scene on friday, president moon jae in promised a full investigation.  the government as a whole will thoroughly probe this accident s cause and process of response, and although after the fact, the investigation and measures will be such that, at least, there will not be lingering deep sorrow,  he said. on monday, a separate fire at a construction site at an apartment complex south of seoul killed one person and injured 14 others, according to yonhap.

" the white house plans to release a brief document in early  to mid september outlining a framework for overhauling the u.s. tax code, according to three sources familiar with the matter. in a sign of the trump administration’s struggles to advance its domestic policy agenda, the three to five page document would not be accompanied by tax legislation, as some had expected, said the sources, who were not authorized to speak publicly. but the framework would come from the “big six” congressional and administration leaders on tax reform, the same group that released a joint statement on taxes in july, after months of closed door talks. it was unclear whether all of the big six members have agreed on the release. but two sources said the white house has told business representatives and lobbyists in recent days to expect a tax reform framework next month. the white house had no comment. white house legislative director marc short told a july forum he expected legislation to come before lawmakers for debate after the sept. 4 u.s. labor day holiday and be voted on in the house of representatives and the senate in october and november. sources said the framework document would not be accompanied by legislation. but it could provide a starting point for a tax bill. it would lay out areas of agreement between the trump administration, the senate and the house of representatives, and could also include input from discussions with democrats. financial markets rallied in late 2016 and early this year on expectations that trump would cut corporate taxes early in his presidency. but after more than six months in power, he has yet to score a major legislative victory or introduce significant legislation of any kind to congress.  corporate lobbyists and independent analysts say tax legislation, if it can move forward at all, is unlikely to be approved before early 2018. house ways and means committee chairman kevin brady and senate finance committee chairman orrin hatch have said they plan to consider tax legislation later this year. but neither has set a deadline. the big six — brady, hatch, house speaker paul ryan, senate republican majority leader mitch mcconnell, treasury secretary steven mnuchin and white house economic adviser gary cohn — said in their july statement that they were charging the two committees with developing and drafting legislation.

" israel was upbeat about u.s. president donald trump s anticipated announcement on friday of major steps against the international nuclear deal with iran, but voiced doubt that the tougher tack by washington could turn around tehran. while the white house s distaste for the 2015 pact may be sweet to the ears of israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu, his government is mindful of the limits of any unilateral u.s. action in the face of dissent from other big power signatories. some israeli officials quietly question whether washington has the will to follow through, noting what they deem insufficient u.s. efforts to stem the entrenchment in next door syria of iran allied forces helping damascus in the civil war. trump was expected to say in a 1645 gmt speech that he will not re certify the nuclear agreement in light of iran s ballistic missile projects and involvement in regional trouble spots. that would give the u.s. congress 60 days to decide whether to reimpose sanctions on tehran that were suspended in return for it rolling back technologies with nuclear bomb making potential.  netanyahu spokesmen declined to comment on the pending speech. a veteran israeli cabinet minister from netanyahu s likud party sounded cheered by trump s resolve, but appeared to note the depth of partisan rifts around the u.s. administration.   the outcome that could happen, and this is the only positive outcome we can see at this stage, is that congress manages to come together around new, significant sanctions,  the minister, tzachi hanegbi, told tel aviv radio station 102 fm.  (that) will confront a lot of gigantic international companies which are today streaming to the iranians ... with a dilemma of having to choose between the iranians and trading with the world s biggest economy, which is the united states.  netanyahu has lobbied hard against the iran deal, delivering a speech in congress shortly before it was signed that angered then u.s. president barack obama. addressing the u.n. general assembly last month, netanyahu urged world powers that negotiated the deal to  fix it or nix it.  he called specifically for cancelling a core  sunset clause  that removes caps on iran s nuclear projects after a number of years.  asked about the sunset clause in the radio interview, hanegbi gave no indication israel believed it would be reviewed. he noted the resistance that trump s new measures faced from european powers, russia and iran, which has threatened to quit the nuclear deal if the u.s. imposes new sanctions against it. iran, hanegbi assessed,  will not yield at all   period   in other words, not just not within 60 days, but neither within 60 months or 60 years, because they really do not believe that the world will reverse course. they look rather mockingly at the united states.   but he added,  if the united states reverses course and begins a process of building delegitimation for the agreement, it could be that the world, part of the west, will join it in a process that could take time ... there is still a long way to go until the dangers of this deal pass.  israel is believed to have the middle east s only nuclear arsenal with about 200 warheads and sees iran s nuclear activity as a threat to its existence. it refuses to confirm or deny that it has nuclear weapons. there has been dissent within israel over the nuclear deal, with several netanyahu ex advisers grudgingly coming out in its favor. his former defense minister, ehud barak, told the new york times on wednesday:  like many israelis, i think the iran deal is a bad deal. but it is a done deal.  barak warned that any u.s. withdrawal from the agreement would not be followed by other world powers and could prompt iran   which denies seeking nuclear weapons   to work on a bomb. hanegbi dismissed such predictions as  nonsense .   iran has no interest in withdrawing from the agreement (because that) would immediately unite russia and china to the united states  against it, he told the radio station. he noted   as have u.n. nuclear inspectors   that the iranians  have not budged a hair s breadth from their commitments under the deal .

" venezuela s opposition is shifting its focus to forthcoming state elections as protests aimed at ousting president nicolas maduro have subsided following the installation of an all powerful, pro government legislative body. four months of violent demonstrations in which at least 125 people were killed have all but stopped due to fatigue among protesters and disillusionment at seeing the ruling socialist party cement vast powers despite the concerted opposition push.  most opposition leaders say october s elections for governors in all the country s 23 states now represent the best means to keep pressuring maduro, providing a chance to win some of the governorships at stake and an opportunity for a protest vote to demonstrate the president s unpopularity. the opposition, which boycotted the elections for the constituent assembly, accused electoral authorities of inflating turn out figures for the july 30 vote. there are few options available for adversaries of maduro, who maintains control over the opec nation despite widespread public anger about triple digit inflation and chronic shortages of basic goods.  venezuelans are fighting against a continued rupture of the constitutional order,  said opposition leader henrique capriles, who is governor of miranda state but who is not running in next month s election and who is barred from holding public office once his term expires. nevertheless he urged venezuelans to vote in the elections.  if you abstain, then it s more difficult to bring about the political change that all venezuelans want,  capriles told reporters. capriles has called his own barring from office   because of alleged irregularities in managing public funds   a socialist party move to sideline him. governorships provide little in the way of a platform to directly challenge maduro. but they are coveted by politicians because they offer launching pads for political careers and the possibility to channel state resources toward political allies.  the opposition s participation in next month s poll ensures it will have witnesses at voting stations and at the election council headquarters. opposition coalition leaders say that should allow them to quickly identify any attempt to alter results. however, some who spent months on the streets with the encouragement of opposition leaders, especially young members of a self styled  resistance  movement, feel betrayed. they say turning attention so quickly to the election legitimizes what they view as maduro s authoritarianism and insults the memory of slain protesters. they also see a contradiction with the opposition s decision to boycott july s  vote for the constituent assembly. maduro pushed for the creation of the assembly, which is meant to rewrite the constitution but which has no formal check on its powers, saying it would restore stability to a country in turmoil over the widespread anti government protests.  it has broadly supplanted the congress, which the opposition won control of in a 2015 landslide vote. small opposition party vente venezuela and its founder maria corina machado, who has a high profile in the media but limited influence, broke with the opposition s democratic unity coalition over its decision to join next month s vote.  the main opposition parties have nominated candidates and opinion polls show that in a free and fair vote they would likely take a majority, compared to just three governorships they won in 2012. but the socialist party controlled constituent assembly may bar some of them from running or from holding office if they win.  last week, the assembly said it would seek the prosecution of opposition leaders for treason for attempting to block international financing for maduro s government and for allegedly seeking a military intervention against him. government leaders say the end of the protests is evidence the constituent assembly has brought peace to the country. they add that the opposition s decision to register candidates is a sign they believe in the electoral system despite their complaints of fraud.  the constituent assembly has calmed the country,  said assembly president delcy rodriguez.  as soon as it was inaugurated, venezuela returned to tranquility.   maduro says the country is a victim of an  economic war  by the opposition, and insists the assembly is a symbol of venezuela s vibrant democracy. the opposition took to the streets in late march to protest a supreme court ruling that briefly allowed it to assume the powers of congress, and maintained near daily rallies until the end of july. by then, street mobilizations were in decline and what had initially been massive marches steadily gave way to violent clashes between security forces and small groups of hooded demonstrators throwing rocks and at times vandalizing property. recent opposition rallies have attracted only a few hundred people. u.s. president donald trump has imposed sanctions on top ruling socialist party officials, in some cases for their participation in the constituent assembly, while the european union and most latin american nations condemned the body. maduro has acquired the reputation as a dictator around the world, said opposition leader freddy guevara in an interview in august broadcast on the internet, adding that street protests were crucial in shifting public opinion.  i m convinced that we have to confront the dictatorship in any situation that we can,  said guevara.

" backers of a global accord to fight climate change that formally comes into force on friday say they are confident the deal can survive any legal challenges by u.s. republican candidate donald trump if he wins next week’s presidential election. trump has threatened to reject the accord negotiated by nearly 200 governments, including that of u.s. president barack obama. trump once tweeted that global warming was a concept invented by the chinese to harm u.s. industry. by contrast, his democratic rival hillary clinton has strongly supported the plan, which enters into force after major greenhouse gas emitters the united states, china and india ratified it. the paris agreement aims to phase out man made greenhouse gases in the second half of the century to avert floods, heatwaves, droughts and rising sea levels.   delegates from signatory nations meet in the moroccan city of marrakesh on nov. 7 18 to start turning their many promises on tackling climate change into action and draw up a “rule book” for the sometimes fuzzily worded accord reached last december. adding urgency, 2016 is set to be the hottest year since records began in the 19th century. the u.s. election, on nov. 8, injects a large dose of political uncertainty into the gathering of environment ministers and senior officials in marrakesh. the relatively speedy ratification of the climate pact, a year before many predictions, was partly driven by trump’s threats to reject the accord. some delegates played down the risk of a president trump reneging on the deal. “the momentum is such that it would take a heck of a climate skeptic to back pedal,” said tosi mpanu mpanu of the democratic republic of congo, who heads the group of 48 least developed countries at the morocco negotiations. “that’s really why we have had this strong mobilization (to ratify). if trump wins i don’t think it will change anything.”‘ moroccan environment minister hakima el haite, who will host the marrakesh meeting, said he did not expect trump, if elected,  would challenge the agreement, saying the american people were generally supportive of climate action. and, as a businessman, “(trump) will understand that climate change is an opportunity to create jobs and new technologies”, she told reuters recently in new york. its entry into force gives some protection for the paris agreement under international law. its article 28 says any government wanting to quit has to wait through four years of formalities   the length of a u.s. presidential term. if he wins, trump is likely to focus his efforts domestically on undoing obama’s plans to cut u.s. emissions, such as from coal fired power plants. the paris agreement also helped to unlock u.n. accords this year to limit emissions from airlines and from powerful greenhouse gases used in air conditioners and refrigerators. “there has been astonishing progress” on climate change after years of deadlock, said andrew steer, head of the world resources institute think tank. the global pacts contrast with more nationalist forces that helped trump to win the u.s. republican nomination for president and, on the other side of the atlantic, britain’s vote in june to leave the european union. the paris agreement enters into force after passing a threshold last month of ratification by 55 nations representing 55 percent of greenhouse gas emissions. the tally is now 87 nations representing about 60 percent of emissions. the united states alone accounts for 18 percent of global emissions. under a vienna convention on the law of treaties, trump could not renounce the u.s. share and then argue that the entire entry into force was invalid. “entry into force only goes one way. it can’t be reversed,” said elliot diringer, executive vice president of the non partisan center for climate and energy solutions in washington.  but there could be legal challenges. the u.s. republican party platform says obama, a democrat who used his executive powers to ratify the agreement, should have submitted it to the senate, where it would almost certainly have been rejected. governments in marrakesh will try to bolster the pact, which sets many goals for cuts in greenhouse gas emissions by 2025 or 2030. governments are under pressure to spell out what they will do now rather than leave it to their successors. at its core, the paris agreement promises to limit global warming to “well below” 2 degrees celsius (3.6 fahrenheit) above pre industrial times. but current pledges for limiting emissions are too weak and will allow temperatures to rise by perhaps 3c (5.4f) or more by 2100. diplomats expect it will take two years or more to write a rule book for the accord. among difficulties, the agreement lets all countries set their own targets for emissions. that free for all design helped ensure wide support but is at odds with a need for a central set of rules to monitor and report greenhouse gas emissions from factories, cars, farms and power plants. irrespective of the rules, the prices of renewable energies are falling sharply, prompting a shift from fossil fuels.  u.s. climate envoy jonathan pershing said wind and solar energy accounted for two thirds of all new electricity generating capacity installed in the united states in 2015. “the u.s. solar industry now employs more people than coal,” he said. still, trump says he will promote the u.s. coal and oil industries to safeguard domestic jobs and national security. he says a shift from fossil fuels would force the united states to be “begging for oil again” from middle east suppliers.

" thailand s ousted former prime minister thaksin shinawatra will be charged with royal insult and computer crimes, the junta s attorney general said on friday, a day after a court issued a second arrest warrant for his sister. thaksin, whose populist movement s struggle with the thai establishment has dominated politics for over a decade, lives in exile after fleeing thailand to escape a jail sentence for corruption after he was overthrown in a 2006 coup. his sister, yingluck shinawatra, overthrown as prime minister in 2014, fled thailand in august to avoid conviction in a criminal negligence case she said was politically motivated. she was jailed for five years in absentia. attorney general khemchai chutiwong did not give details as to exactly how thaksin had insulted the monarchy, which is protected by a stringent lese majeste law.  this is a criminal case,  he told a news conference.  right now it remains to find the individual.  supporters of the shinawatras, who had the backing of poor, rural voters, have won every election since 2001. they remain a significant force ahead of a ballot the military has said could happen as early as next year. it was not clear whether the attorney general s office was referring to accusations of royal defamation against thaksin that thai police said they were investigating after he gave an interview to south korean media in 2015. reuters was unable to immediately contact thaksin or his lawyers for comment. republishing details of an alleged offense to the monarchy could also be a crime under a law that sets a sentence of up to 15 years for each offense of royal insult. since taking power in a 2014 coup, the military government has pursued supporters of the shinawatras and has jailed several leaders of the red shirted political movement that backed them. a criminal court issued a second arrest warrant for yingluck on thursday for violating immigration law during her escape. thaksin s son, panthongtae shinawatra, has also complained of victimization and this week called for the dropping of a money laundering investigation against him. thaksin has a home in dubai but travels frequently. his thai passports were revoked after the interview he gave in 2015 but he holds the passport of at least one other country.

" u.s. air force b 1b lancer bombers escorted by fighter jets flew in international airspace over waters east of north korea on saturday, in a show of force the pentagon said demonstrated the range of military options available to president donald trump. the flight, which was disclosed shortly before north korea s foreign minister was due to address the united nations, was the farthest north of the demilitarized zone separating north and south korea that any u.s. fighter jet or bomber has flown in the 21st century, the pentagon said.  this mission is a demonstration of u.s. resolve and a clear message that the president has many military options to defeat any threat,  said pentagon spokeswoman dana white, calling   north korea s weapons program  a grave threat.   we are prepared to use the full range of military capabilities to defend the u.s. homeland and our allies.  the flight follows a week of heightened rhetoric from washington and pyongyang, with trump and kim jong un trading  insults. trump called the north korean leader a  madman  on friday, a day after kim dubbed him a  mentally deranged u.s. dotard.  pyongyang conducted its sixth and largest nuclear test on sept. 3 and has launched dozens of missiles this year as it accelerates a program aimed at enabling it to target the united states with a nuclear tipped missile. the north has threatened to test a hydrogen bomb over the pacific. the pentagon said the b 1b lancer bombers came from guam and the u.s. air force f 15c eagle fighter escorts came from okinawa, japan. it said the operation showed the seriousness with which it took north korea s  reckless behavior.

" grandparents of u.s. citizens from six muslim majority countries are now eligible to receive u.s. visas, according to a state department memo seen by reuters that reflects the latest court ruling on u.s. president donald trump’s travel ban. the memo, or cable, from u.s. secretary of state rex tillerson was sent to all u.s. diplomatic posts overseas on friday after a u.s. district judge in hawaii issued a ruling late on thursday limiting the scope of the administration’s temporary ban on refugees and travelers from the six countries. u.s. district judge derrick watson in honolulu found the government cannot bar grandparents and other relatives of united states citizens from iran, libya, somalia, sudan, syria and yemen from getting visas under the ban. watson declined to put his ruling on hold pending appeal, meaning it went into effect immediately. the administration has asked the supreme court and the san francisco based 9th u.s. circuit court of appeals to block the decision.  the july 14 cable updated the definition of ""close family"" that are exempt from the temporary travel ban laid down in trump's march 6 executive order. (the cable can be read at: reut.rs/2uc040y) the cable reversed the state department’s previous, narrow definition of close family and stated that “grandparents, grandchildren, brothers in law, sisters in law, aunts and uncles, nephews and nieces, and cousins” are eligible for visas. consulates and embassies do not need to reopen any visa applications refused under the prior, narrower definition of close family members, the cable said. between march 10 and march 17, tillerson issued four cables, originally giving instructions on implementing the travel ban,  then rescinding much of his guidance because of court rulings and because it had been issued without approval from the white house office of management and budget. in another reversal, the state department had originally interpreted the supreme court’s june 26 ruling to exclude fiancés, saying they do not count as a close family relationship eligible for an exemption to the travel ban. just before the 90 day travel ban was to take effect on june 29, the state department said fiancés would be counted as close family. “these guys (consular officers) have had enough whiplash over the past six, seven months but they continue to fulfill their role, which is to process visa applications,” said stephen pattison, a former state department consular official now working as an immigration attorney. “the people who are really getting whiplash are the people in the department who are responsible for formulating the policy, getting it approved and getting it sent out.” a state department official declined to comment on internal communications. “we regularly provide updated operational instructions to our embassies and consulates around the world to ensure that our consular officers are using the most up to date vetting procedures as they adjudicate visas,” the official said on condition of anonymity.  “we are processing visa applications for nationals of the six affected countries as directed by the executive order and to the extent permitted by court decisions,” the official said. last month the supreme court partially revived the march 6 ban that had been blocked by lower courts. it said the ban could take effect, but people with a “bona fide relationship” to a u.s. person or entity could not be barred.

"representative justin amash (r-mich.) thinks that providing disaster relief to the people of flint, michigan is unconstitutional (full disclosure: amash is my current representative). amash is a libertarian, and a constitutional originalist. that means that he takes the extreme view that the constitution should be interpreted as the original framers would have. he s besties with rand paul, and a darling of the tea party. i have been to many of his speaking events. no matter what the topic is, his supporters mostly only want to know the latest news on benghazi.amash s extremist view, that is shared with the likes of justice scalia, has led him to be very vocal in his opposition to giving federal assistance to the people of flint. here is amash s reasoning for his opposition: while the u.s. constitution does not authorize the federal government to intervene in an intrastate matter like this one, the state of michigan should provide comprehensive assistance to the people of flint. the residents who were harmed deserve an independent, nonpartisan investigation, and the persons responsible for this crisis must be held accountable. michigan needs federal assistance. that s the bottom line. it is estimated that it will cost $1.5 billion dollars to fix flint s water system. it is tragic that republicans can rail against the government, working to dismantle the effectiveness of its apparatus on every level, only to have their failed schemes be bailed out by the government. however, we are the united states. we come together in times of crisis. man-made, or otherwise. 10 people have already died from legionaries disease, people need help now.there is absolutely no constitutional argument against providing disaster relief to the people of flint, outside of the mad imaginings of what these loons think the constitution is. fortunately, amash and similarly minded people in congress don t have the collective political power to actually prevent disaster relief funds to places that need them.that s why the hurricane sandy spending package of $9.7 billion dollars was approved of, despite amash s and other republicans votes against the package, in 2013. yeah, he voted against disaster relief for those hurt by hurricane sandy too. at least amash is consistent in his world view, even if that world view is a complete departure from reality.by gage skidmore from peoria, az, united states of america (justin amashuploaded by albertherring) [cc by-sa 2.0], via wikimedia commons",1

" the new prime ministers of poland and the czech republic vowed not to give any ground on the divisive issue of hosting refugees as they arrived in brussels on thursday for their first summit of european union leaders. more than two years after a massive influx of refugees and migrants from the middle east and africa created deep divisions in the eu, members are still feuding over how to share the burden of caring for asylum seekers. the row pits frontline countries italy and greece, and rich destination countries like germany, against four ex communist states on the eu s eastern edge   poland, the czech republic, hungary and slovakia   that have refused to welcome refugees. poland s mateusz morawiecki and the czech republic s andrej babis, who both took office this month and said they wanted good and pragmatic ties with the eu, made clear that they would maintain the hard line of their predecessors on migration.  it is worth investing considerable amounts of money in helping refugees in (regions) they are fleeing from. the help on the ground there is much more effective,  said morawiecki, explaining warsaw would do that instead of accepting refugees. the four eastern prime ministers offered 35 million euros to italy on thursday to support eu backed migration projects in libya aimed at curbing immigration to europe. [l8n1ob30j] italian prime minister paolo gentiloni, arriving at the summit, welcomed the financial contribution but said the four still needed to accept refugees.  i think it was a very important decision,  he said of the money pulled together by the four easterners.  differences, however, remain. we will continue to insist that a commitment on the relocation of refugees is needed.  two years after the biggest influx of refugees and migrants into europe since world war two, an eu deal with turkey has shut the main eastern mediterranean route through greece and across the balkans used by more than 1 million people in 2015. the biggest remaining route is from libya across the mediterranean to italy. hundreds of thousands have been making the trip each year and thousands have died at sea. new efforts to curb smuggling from libya s coast have reduced the numbers in recent months, but human rights groups say thousands of african migrants are now stuck in squalid conditions in libyan camps. the southern eu countries where most migrants first arrive, and the wealthier northern countries where many seek asylum, want all eu states to accept at least some refugees. the ex communist eastern states say this amounts to bullying them to help solve political problems for their wealthier neighbors. all eu leaders will discuss the issue over dinner in brussels on thursday, though no decisions are expected, with a french source stressing the controversy would take much more time to untangle. [l8n1od360].  the dispute reopened this week when donald tusk, the former polish prime minister who now chairs the summits, came out against obligatory relocation quotas, ruffling feathers in many eu states and the bloc s executive commission.  divisions on migration...are accompanied by emotions which make it hard to find common ground. we should work even more intensively to keep our unity,  tusk said ahead of the summit. but his intervention upset italy, germany and other proponents of the quotas, who warn they could force the waverers to accept refugees in a majority vote if no compromise is found by june.  it won t happen,  babis told reporters ahead of the summit, highlighting that any attempt to impose  nonsensical  quotas in a majority vote would only widen the divisions in the eu. slovakia s robert fico also said unanimity must prevail in the eu, especially on such thorny issues.

" saudi arabia aims to start issuing tourist visas to foreigners next year, a senior saudi official told cnn, as the government seeks to open up the conservative kingdom and find new sources of revenue to diversify its economy.   at present, foreigners traveling to saudi arabia are largely restricted to resident workers and their dependents, business travelers, and muslim pilgrims who are given special visas to travel to holy sites.    the targets are people who want to come and literally experience this country, and really the grandness of this country,  prince sultan bin salman bin abdulaziz, head of the saudi commission for tourism and natural heritage, said in an interview broadcast late on wednesday.   asked about plans for the visas, he replied:  hopefully in 2018,  adding that the government would use online technology to make applying for visas easy. saudi arabia s 32 year old heir to the throne, crown prince mohammed bin salman, is seeking to develop new industries to wean his country off its dependency on oil exports. he has also taken some steps to loosen its ultra strict social restrictions, scaling back the role of religious morality police and announcing plans to allowing women to drive next year. plans to admit significant numbers of tourists from abroad have been discussed for years, only to be blocked by conservative opinion and bureaucracy; the commission announced such a plan as long ago as 2006, but it did not go ahead. this time, the government appears determined to push through the change, partly because of financial pressures. it hopes to earn billions of dollars to cover a state budget deficit caused by low oil prices.  economic reforms aim to lift total tourism spending in the country   by local citizens as well as foreigners   to $46.6 billion in 2020 from $27.9 billion in 2015. prince sultan said his commission was focusing mainly on increasing numbers of local tourists. the commission has estimated saudis spend more than $20 billion annually on tourism abroad, and persuading more of them to holiday inside the country would reduce that drain on the economy. but prince sultan told cnn that his commission was also working to prepare tourist spots for foreigners. the government announced plans in august to develop resorts on about 50 islands off the red sea coast, with the first phase of the project to be completed in 2022. the kingdom also intends to offer visits to historic sites such as mada in saleh, a 2,000 year old nabatean city carved into the rocks of the northern desert. heir to the throne prince mohammed would be the first ruler from a new generation since 1953, after six kings who were all sons of state founder abdulaziz ibn saud. he has announced wide plans for social and political reforms to the kingdom, which is ruled as an absolute monarchy with a powerful clergy that adheres to wahhabism, an ultra austere version of sunni islam.

" u.s. president barack obama on tuesday proposed expanding the earned income tax credit (eitc), which helps low income taxpayers, to give a bigger boost to childless people. some republicans as well as democrats in congress back increasing the tax credit. house of representatives speaker paul ryan, a republican, favors expanding the credit as an incentive for pulling people into work. in his budget blueprint for the fiscal year starting oct. 1, obama proposed doubling the tax credit for workers who are not raising children, bringing the credit to a maximum of about $1,022 a year for them. he said it should be expanded to cover workers with earnings up to 150 percent of the poverty line, so about $18,180 for a single person. under current law the cutoff comes at about $15,040. obama also favors expanding eligibility to single workers between ages 21 24 to help draw them into the workforce; currently they must be 25 to qualify. the earned income tax credit, created in 1975, is intended to promote work as well as help low income people. because it is a refundable credit, it produces a refund if the taxpayer does not owe any taxes. currently it gives more generous benefits to families with children. obama has proposed expanding it for the past two years; ryan agrees it should be increased for childless workers. but they disagree on how it should be funded. obama has talked about closing tax loopholes, while ryan has talked about cutting spending. obama’s budget proposed making the credit available to workers aged 65 and 66, and to workers in the struggling territory of puerto rico. the white house said its proposal would help 13.2 million low income people. the congressional research service (crs) said recently that in 2013, a total of $68.1 billion was claimed by 28.8 million tax filers under the program.  but it said the rules were too complex and up to a quarter of payments were issued “improperly”. obama’s budget also proposed $12 billion over 10 years to supplement food stamps for poor families when school meal programs are closed in the summer.  it asked for $2 billion in emergency aid for families in crisis, a $1.2 billion increase in rental assistance to poor families, $328 million in education and housing grants to poor neighborhoods, and a $15 million pilot program to help poor families move to better neighborhoods.

" apple inc (aapl.o) ceo tim cook has joined a chorus of business leaders who have voiced their opposition to president donald trump after he blamed white nationalists and anti racism activists equally for violence in virginia over the weekend.  “i disagree with the president and others who believe that there is a moral equivalence between white supremacists and nazis, and those who oppose them by standing up for human rights. equating the two runs counter to our ideals as americans,” cook wrote in a note late on wednesday to employees, according to technology news website recode.   cook also said in the letter that apple will donate $1 million a piece to the southern poverty law center and the anti defamation league and will match two for one their donations to the organizations and other human rights groups until sept. 30.  “regardless of your political views, we must all stand together on this one point — that we are all equal. as a company, through our actions, our products and our voice, we will always work to ensure that everyone is treated equally and with respect,” cook wrote. cook’s letter came hours after trump disbanded two high profile business advisory councils as several chief executives quit in protest over his remarks blaming weekend violence in charlottesville, virginia on anti racism activists as well as white nationalists that left a 32 year old woman dead.      “the events of the past several days have been deeply troubling for me, and i’ve heard from many people at apple who are saddened, outraged or confused,” cook said.  “what occurred in charlottesville has no place in our country. hate is a cancer, and left unchecked it destroys everything in its path. its scars last generations. history has taught us this time and time again, both in the united states and countries around the world,” cook added.          earlier on wednesday, the company was disabling apple pay on several websites that sell attire and items in support of white nationalists and hate groups, several tech news websites reported.  apple joined social media networks twitter inc and linkedin, music service spotify ltd and security firm cloudflare inc that were cutting off services to hate groups or removing material that they said spread hate.

" saudi arabia’s foreign ministry condemned the passage of a u.s. law that would allow families of victims of the sept. 11, 2001  attacks to sue the kingdom for damages, calling it a matter of “great concern” in a statement on thursday. the u.s. senate and house of representatives voted overwhelmingly on wednesday to approve legislation that will allow the families of those killed in the 2001 attacks on the united states to seek damages from the saudi government. “the erosion of sovereign immunity will have a negative impact on all nations, including the united states,” said the saudi statement, which was carried on state news agency spa after a day of stony silence from riyadh. the foreign ministry expressed hope that the u.s. congress would correct the legislation “to avoid the serious unintended consequences that may ensue,” without elaborating on what the consequences might be. riyadh has always dismissed suspicions that it backed the attackers, who killed nearly 3,000 people under the banner of islamist militant group al qaeda. fifteen out of the 19 hijackers were saudi nationals. the saudi government financed an extensive lobbying campaign against the “justice against sponsors of terrorism act”, or jasta, in the run up to the vote, and warned it would undermine the principle of sovereign immunity. but saudi officials who had lobbied against the bill stopped short of threatening any specific retaliation if the law was passed. the saudi riyal fell against the u.s. dollar in the forward foreign exchange market on thursday after the law was passed. analysts said a successful lawsuit against the saudi government would be unlikely at best, but speculated that the uncertainty surrounding the legal implications could negatively affect bilateral trade and investment with a major ally. saudi arabia’s gulf state neighbor, united arab emirates, warned of the long term grave repercussions of congress overriding obama’s veto. in a tweet late on thursday, anwar gargash, the uae’s minister of state for foreign  affairs, called the u.s. congress move “a dangerous precedent in international law that undermines the principle of sovereign immunity and the future of sovereign investments in the united states”.  in a later tweet gargash said his country’s reactions on both the legal and investment fronts should not be hasty and that “easing the damage requires joint action”.

" the u.s. education department has left thousands of student loan borrowers who were defrauded by corinthian colleges inc in limbo by prolonging a process created by the obama administration that was supposed to speedily cancel their debts, according to 20 state attorneys general and regulators. in the final months that president barack obama, a democrat, was in office the department finalized a regulation easing the way for students from struggling for profit colleges such as corinthian and itt tech to quickly receive debt relief that they were entitled to by law.  in a letter sent on monday to u.s. education secretary betsy devos, the state attorneys general said they were concerned about growing backlogs of applications for the relief and of loans approved for discharge that simply need a sign off. the letter, signed by the top lawyers of illinois, california, massachusetts and other states, was released on tuesday. they said they were particularly troubled that some borrowers had been notified their loans were eligible for fast discharge under the regulation but that the cancellation has not yet happened. according to the letter, the department stated in january it had notified 23,000 borrowers that their loan forgiveness should be complete within the 60 to 120 days, but in many cases loans have not been canceled.  that means some of corinthian’s students could still be on the hook for monthly payments or possibly face debt collection. work on discharging loans that have been approved is underway, according to education department press secretary liz hill. “we are working with servicers to get these loans discharged as expeditiously as possible,” hill said in a statement. “some borrowers should expect to obtain discharges within the next few weeks.” virginia attorney general mark herring said about 5,000 past corinthian students in the state received letters last december directing to apply on line for relief. since then, his office has received queries about delays in the process.    “delay in canceling this debt, especially for students who have already been approved, could put even greater financial strain on students in virginia and around the country,” he said in a statement. amid federal and state investigations in 2015 into its post graduation rates, for profit corinthian filed for bankruptcy and abruptly closed its 28 schools.

" a somali refugee who had been on a watch list over extremist views faced five counts of attempted murder and terror charges on sunday after canadian police said he stabbed a police officer and ran down four pedestrians with a car in edmonton, alberta. the suspect, a 30 year old man whom police did not identify, had been investigated two years ago for promoting extremist ideology but was not deemed a threat, the royal canadian mounted police (rcmp) said.  rcmp assistant commissioner marlin degrand said an  exhaustive investigation  into the man in 2015 did not uncover sufficient evidence to pursue charges. canadian media identified the suspect as abdulahi hasan sharif, although reuters was not immediately able to confirm his identity. police cordoned off an apartment block near downtown edmonton and plainclothes officers were seen carrying large bags of equipment into the building. the attacks in the western canadian city began when a chevy malibu hit a police officer standing in front of a football stadium at about 8:15 p.m. mountain time on saturday (10.15 p.m. et), sending him flying into the air. the driver got out of the car and stabbed the officer multiple times before fleeing, according to police accounts and surveillance footage of the incident. police identified the suspect when he was stopped at a checkpoint and his license showed that he was the owner of the malibu. he fled the checkpoint and was apprehended after a police chase across a downtown street, during which he hit four pedestrians. a flag of the islamic state militant group was found inside the malibu, said rod knecht, police chief of edmonton, alberta s provincial capital. edmonton mayor don iveson told reporters:  to the best of our knowledge, this was a lone wolf attack. there s no immediate cause for panic or concern.  u.s. national security agencies strongly leaned toward the conclusion that the suspect acted alone, although they were reviewing the matter, a u.s. official told reuters.  the police officer, who had stab wounds to the head and face, was released from a hospital on sunday along with two pedestrians. a third pedestrian was upgraded to stable from critical, while the fourth suffered a fractured skull and had regained consciousness. on sunday, two women were stabbed to death and their assailant shot dead by a soldier in the southern french port city of marseille in what officials describe as a  likely terrorist act . prime minister justin trudeau called the edmonton attack  another example of the hate that we must remain ever vigilant against.  canada s government said it would keep the terrorist threat level at medium, where it has been since late 2014. the alberta muslim public affairs council denounced the attack and hundreds attended a sunday evening rally organized by the group.  these types of acts, whether terrorism or not, seek to divide communities. we have to show that s not going to happen, not in edmonton,  said group spokesman aurangzeb qureshi.  canada has been dealing in recent months with a surge in illegal border crossings by people seeking refugee status, which has renewed debate over whether it should tighten its borders.  the north american country has not experienced as much violence from extremist attacks as the united states and western european nations, but there have been several deadly incidents in recent years. in january, a french canadian university student was charged with murder after six people were shot and killed inside a quebec city mosque, in what trudeau called  a terrorist attack.  in august 2016, canadian police raided an ontario home and killed aaron driver, who they said was an islamic state supporter preparing an attack on a canadian city with a homemade bomb. in 2014, canada was stunned by two deadly attacks that police said were the work of homegrown radicals and led to tougher new anti terrorism measures.  a gunman killed a soldier at ottawa s national war memorial before launching an attack on the canadian parliament in october 2014. in the same week, a man ran down two soldiers in quebec, killing one. in 2015, a videotape attributed to al shabaab, a somali based islamist militant group behind a deadly 2013 attack on a kenyan shopping center, threatened north american malls, including the west edmonton mall.

" kansas governor sam brownback has ordered state officials to cut off funding for planned parenthood and its affiliates through the state medicaid program, a move the organization said on wednesday it would challenge in court. brownback, a republican, said in his state of the state address on tuesday that he would direct the state health secretary to ensure that no taxpayer money go to planned parenthood, which he said trafficked in baby body parts. “no longer will we send the money of hard working kansans to fund an industry that disrespects life and violates the moral conscience of our people,” brownback said in a statement. the governor’s statement was an apparent reference to videos  secretly recorded by an anti abortion group that activists said showed that planned parenthood officials in some states had discussed the sale of aborted fetal tissue. planned parenthood has denied any illegal payments, calling the videos distortions of the issue of fetal tissue donations. the organization has said it has received only reimbursements for its costs, which are legal under u.s. law. the kansas department of health and environment said it would issue a termination letter to planned parenthood of kansas and mid missouri. laura mcquade, president and chief executive of the kansas and mid missouri planned parenthood, said the planned termination would result in a legal battle. “kansans and their health care providers are not mr. brownback’s punching bag and we will fight back,” mcquade said. federal funds cannot be used for abortions, but planned parenthood also provides medicaid covered services such as contraception, cancer screening and other care. several states have sought to cut off funding for planned parenthood following the release of the videos. courts have blocked some of those attempts at least temporarily in utah, louisiana, alabama and other states.

" backers of a u.s. russian plan to build nuclear reactors across the middle east bragged after the u.s. election they had backing from donald trump’s national security adviser michael flynn for a project that required lifting sanctions on russia, documents reviewed by reuters show. the documents, which have not previously been made public, reveal new aspects of the plan, including the proposed involvement of a russian company currently under u.s. sanctions to manufacture nuclear equipment. that company, major engineering and construction firm omz oao, declined to comment. the documents do not show whether flynn, a retired army lieutenant general, took concrete steps to push the proposal with trump and his aides. but they do show that washington based nuclear power consultancy acu strategic partners believed that both flynn, who had worked as an adviser to the firm as late as mid 2016, and trump were firmly in its corner. “donald trump’s election as president is a game changer because trump’s highest foreign policy priority is to stabilize u.s. relations with russia which are now at a historical low point,” acu’s managing director, alex copson, wrote in a nov. 16, 2016 email to potential business partners, eight days after the election. white house officials did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment. acu declined comment and also declined to make copson available for an interview. previously they told a congressional committee that they had not had any dealings with flynn since may 2016, before trump became the republican party’s presidential candidate.  flynn’s lawyer, robert kelner, did not respond to a request for comment. flynn pleaded guilty on friday to lying to the fbi about a discussion with the former russian ambassador to washington, sergey kislyak, in late december 2016 regarding sanctions.   the documents also show that acu proposed ending ukraine’s opposition to lifting sanctions on russia by giving a ukrainian company a $45 billion contract to provide turbine generators for reactors to be built in saudi arabia and other mideast nations.     the contract to state owned turboatom, and loans to ukraine from gulf arab states, would “require ukraine to support lifting us and eu sanctions on russia,” copson wrote in the nov. 16 email. a turboatom spokeswoman said she did not have an immediate comment on the matter.     the email was titled “trump/putin me marshall plan concept.” me stands for middle east. the title, evoking the post world war two plan to rebuild western european economies, reflected the hopes of the plan’s backers that trump and russian president vladimir putin could cooperate on a project that would boost middle east economies.     the email can be seen here: tmsnrt.rs/2aldocy the acu documents reviewed by reuters include emails, business presentations and financial estimates and date from late autumn 2016. as part of their investigation into the trump election campaign’s ties to russia, special counsel robert mueller and democrats on the house of representatives’ oversight committee are probing whether flynn promoted the middle east nuclear power project as national security adviser in trump’s white house. flynn resigned after just 24 days as national security adviser after it became known he had lied to vice president mike pence by telling him he had not discussed u.s. sanctions on russia with kislyak in late december.  in response to questions about the emails and documents, acu referred reuters to letters written in june and september by acu scientist thomas cochran to the house oversight committee. in those letters, cochran had laid out the project’s strategy, describing a “ready to go” consortium that included  french, russian, israeli and ukrainian interests, without naming specific companies.  representative elijah cummings, the committee’s top democrat, said the panel’s republican chairman, trey gowdy, has for months rejected democrats’ requests to ask the white house for documents pertaining to the acu proposal. gowdy “has blocked all efforts to allow committee members to vote on issuing subpoenas,” cummings told reuters. gowdy did not respond to requests for comment. the acu’s nuclear reactor plan aimed to provide washington’s middle east allies with nuclear power in a way that didn’t risk nuclear weapons proliferation and also helped counter iranian influence, improve dismal u.s. russian relations, and revive the moribund u.s. nuclear industry, according to the documents seen by reuters.     the wall street journal and the washington post reported this week that flynn pushed a version of the nuclear project within the white house by instructing his staff to rework a memo written by a former business associate into policy for trump to sign.      two u.s. officials familiar with the issue told reuters the policy document flynn prepared for trump’s approval proposed  working with russia on a nuclear reactor project but did not specifically mention acu. the officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said they did not know if trump had read the memo or acted upon it.     on nov. 18, 2016, 10 days after trump won the presidential election, acu’s copson received an email from nuclear non proliferation expert reuben sorensen saying that he had updated flynn on the nuclear project’s status. sorensen’s role in the project was not clear from the emails.     “flynn is getting closer to (being named) national security advisor. expect an announcement soon. this is a big win for the acu project,” sorensen wrote.  “spoke with him via backchannels earlier this week. he has always believed in the vision of the acu effort ... we need to let him get settled into the new position, but update him shortly thereafter,” sorensen added. the email can be seen here: tmsnrt.rs/2ztqxcz reuters could not independently confirm a briefing took place. sorensen did not reply to an email seeking comment.     on nov. 30, 2016, copson briefed u.s. representative ed royce, republican chairman of the house foreign affairs committee, on the nuclear project, an email shows.     copson was joined by jim hamel, a senior official from curtiss wright corp., which has a nuclear division based in royce’s california district and was eager for a role in the multi billion dollar project.     in a follow up email on dec. 5 to a royce aide, hamel wrote, “we hope that the chairman will follow up on alex’s suggestion to reach out to general flynn” to discuss the project.     royce’s spokesman, cory fritz, confirmed the briefing to reuters. “no action was ever taken by the chairman or the committee,” he said in an email.     hamel and curtiss wright declined to comment.     flynn was an adviser to acu from april 2015 to june 2016, according to amended financial disclosure forms he filed in august 2017 to the office of government ethics.       democrats on the house oversight committee say that when flynn applied last year to renew his government security clearance, he failed to disclose a june 2015 trip he made to egypt and israel to promote the reactor project. flynn has not commented

" the u.s. government made it tougher on wednesday for americans to visit cuba and do business in the country, making good on a pledge by president donald trump to roll back his democratic predecessor s move toward warmer ties with havana. the restrictions, which take effect on thursday, are aimed at preventing the military, intelligence and security arms of cuba s communist government from benefiting from american tourists and trade, the white house said. they fill in the regulatory detail on a trump policy speech in june, in which the republican president called for a tightening of restrictions. he said then that the cuban government continued to oppress its people and former president barack obama had made too many concessions in his 2014 diplomatic breakthrough with washington s former cold war foe. the regulations include a ban on americans doing business with some 180 cuban government entities, holding companies, and tourism companies. the list includes 83 state owned hotels, including famous hotels in old havana such as ernest hemingway s erstwhile favorite haunt the hotel ambos mundos, as well as the city s new luxury shopping mall.  all these measures hurt the cuban people,  said cuba s foreign ministry chief for u.s. affairs josefina vidal. she said that government revenue funds cuba s free education and healthcare systems. speaking to reporters in havana, she called the list  arbitrary  and the regulations a further  setback  in u.s. cuban relations. the new rules were criticized as too lax by republican leaders who favor a hard line, but as counterproductive by those who agreed with obama s rationale for the detente: that washington s many decades of isolating the caribbean island failed to force change. the cuban hotels listed included those run by military linked chains gaviota and habaguanex. republican senator marco rubio of florida, a cuban american, said the list failed to go far enough because it omitted companies like gran caribe hotel group and cubanacan that have ties to the cuban government. democratic senator patrick leahy said the regulations were unfair to cuba, coming as trump was being  feted in beijing  by a communist government  in a country to which americans can travel freely.   the hypocrisy of the white house ideologues is glaring,  leahy said in a statement.  while u.s. travelers will still be able to make authorized trips to cuba with a u.s. based organization and accompanied by a u.s. representative of the group, it will be harder for them to travel individually, according to the new regulations. before obama s opening, travel by many americans was similarly restricted to such organized trips. travelers need to be able to show a  full time schedule  with activities that support cuban people and show  meaningful interaction,  going beyond merely staying in rooms in private homes, eating in private restaurants, or shopping in private stores, a u.s. official told reporters on a conference call. the administration says it is keen to support such small private enterprises that have sprung up around the country under president raul castro s reforms to the largely state controlled economy.  staying or eating or shopping in some of those privately owned places is something that we wanted to encourage. but what we wanted to say is, that alone is not enough,  the official said. however, cubans in the fledgling private sector say the trump administration s more hostile stance toward havana has already hurt their business.  he is putting us in serious danger by frightening away american visitors looking to rent our properties,  said norma hernandez, who rents out rooms on airbnb and who said her  business flourished over the last year thanks to a surge in u.s. visitors. trump s rollback of obama s opening has not affected a  centerpiece of the detente, the restoration of diplomatic ties and the opening of embassies in havana and washington. business contracts and travel arrangements already in place will be allowed to go ahead and will not be subject to the restrictions, officials told reporters. the list of entities that americans cannot do business with includes a special development zone at cuba s mariel port, which cuba hopes to develop into a major caribbean industrial and shipping hub with tax and customs breaks. the national foreign trade council, a business lobby group in washington, called the mariel restriction  counterproductive  because it would hurt a cuban government initiative that could potentially benefit cuban workers. the head of an educational travel company said there were still many legal avenues   as well as commercial flights, cruise ships, u.s. owned hotels, and tour providers   to enable americans to visit cuba. but he said the new restrictions would hurt cuba s private sector, at a time when the economy is already struggling.  u.s. backtracking on cuba could not come at a worse time,  said collin laverty, president of cuba educational travel.

" in a speech on wednesday in phoenix, arizona, republican presidential nominee donald trump outlined his plan for reforming the u.s. immigration system. the new york businessman has made immigration a central issue of his bid for the white house, taking a harder line than his democratic rival, former secretary of state hillary clinton, ahead of the nov. 8 election. trump’s plan includes: 1. building a wall along the border between the united states and mexico. trump emphasized that this would be a physical wall, albeit bolstered by technology. 2. ending “catch and release,” a term often broadly used to refer to practices under which not everyone apprehended by immigration agents is necessarily deported. 3. immediate deportation of undocumented immigrants who have committed crimes. trump has promised to begin these deportations on his first day in office. going forward, undocumented immigrants arrested for committing a crime would be placed into immediate deportation proceedings. 4. blocking funding for “sanctuary cities,” places that limit, to differing extents and through different methods, how much they help immigration officials in the apprehension and deportation of undocumented immigrants. 5. cancellation of executive orders and enforcement of immigration laws. this point would particularly hit two of president barack obama’s executive actions, known by their abbreviations: daca and dapa. the actions gave a certain legal status to certain undocumented immigrants, such as those brought to the united states as children or those who now have american children.  6. suspending visas to immigrants from parts of the world where screening procedures are deemed inadequate. trump singled out syria and libya as two countries from which immigration would be suspended. 7. ensuring that other countries take back their citizens when the united states moves to deport those immigrants. the u.s. supreme court has ruled that these people cannot be detained indefinitely, but without a country to which to return they often are simply released from detention. trump said he would force the immigrants’ home countries to take them back. 8. completing a biometric entry exit visa tracking system. many undocumented immigrants enter the country legally, and then overstay their visas. in those cases, this kind of system would be more effective than a border wall. while such a system has been discussed for years, the logistics remain a major challenge. putting in such a system would likely require major overhauls of u.s. points of entry, such as airports and ports.  9. making it harder for undocumented immigrants to get jobs and benefits. trump specifically cited the e verify system as part of this. that system allows employers to check whether their employees are legally eligible to work in the united states. trump also mentioned ending access to benefit programs such as public housing or food stamps. 10. serving the best interests of american workers. trump’s final point serves as something of a catch all for his immigration proposal. but he also mentioned a few specific goals here, such as limiting immigration. he also talked about being more selective about who gets to enter the country, for example limiting immigration to people who can be financially self sufficient.

" the u.s. state department has suspended plans for an internal review of whether classified information was properly handled in former secretary of state hillary clinton’s emails at the request of the fbi, a spokeswoman said on friday. clinton, the front runner in the race for the democratic party nomination in the nov. 8 presidential election, has apologized for using a private email server for official business while in office from 2009 to 2013 and said she did nothing wrong. the federal bureau of investigation is probing the arrangement. on jan. 29, the state department said 22 emails sent or received by clinton had been upgraded to top secret at the request u.s. intelligence agencies and would not be made public as part of the release of thousands of clinton’s emails. it said that none of the emails was marked classified when sent. at the time, the department also said it would conduct an internal review on whether the information in the emails was classified at the time it passed through clinton’s private clintonemail.com account run on a server in her new york home. the state department consulted the fbi about this in february, and in march the law enforcement agency asked the state department to halt its inquiry. “the fbi communicated to us that we should follow our standard practice, which is to put our internal review on hold while there is an ongoing law enforcement investigation ,” state department spokeswoman elizabeth trudeau told reporters.  “the internal review is on hold, pending completion of the fbi’s work,” she added.” we’ll reassess next steps after the fbi’s work is complete.” a u.s. state department official who spoke on condition of anonymity said the state department had really only done “administrative work” on its review but had held off while waiting for a response from the fbi. “it took a little bit of time for the fbi to respond to our request for advice and in the interim we did not pursue the review out of prudence,” said the official, who declined further comment on the state department review. the government forbids handling of classified information, which may or may not be marked that way, outside secure government controlled channels, and sometimes prosecutes people who remove it from such channels. the government classifies information as top secret if it deems a leak could cause “exceptionally grave damage” to national security. two judges have allowed a group suing for clinton’s records to seek sworn testimony from officials. on tuesday, one judge said there was “evidence of government wrongdoing and bad faith” over the arrangement.",0
" britain’s nigel farage will be at the republican convention in cleveland next week to dole out lessons from his brexit campaign. so will geert wilders, leader of the dutch freedom party, who sees donald trump as an ally in his crusade to prevent an “islamization” of the west. but some mainstream european conservatives who have traveled to previous republican gatherings admit in private to being horrified at the prospect of a trump presidency and are boycotting this year’s spectacle, which runs from july 18 21. many of the center right politicians making the trip from europe admit to secretly rooting for trump’s democratic rival hillary clinton. they are going not to support trump, they say, but to witness “the donald” in the flesh and experience what is shaping up to be one of the rowdiest, most unpredictable republican conventions in decades. “we will see whether trump can reinvent himself at the convention,” guenter krings, a senior lawmaker from german chancellor angela merkel’s conservatives who will make the trip with just one other bundestag colleague, told reuters. “one can only hope so, but i have my doubts.” politicians from around the world are invited every four years to attend the republican and democratic conventions as part of a formal visitors program that includes briefings with campaign managers, pollsters and foreign policy experts. they also spend time in the main convention hall. this year, nearly 120 politicians from center right parties outside the united states are expected, roughly half of them from europe.  trump’s candidacy has presented european parties with traditional links to u.s. republicans with a dilemma. many view his positions — on issues like immigration, security, trade and the divisive brexit question — as closer to those of upstart far right parties whose rise they are struggling to contain. four years ago, when mitt romney was the republican candidate, the center right european people’s party (epp), the largest grouping in the european parliament, sent a delegation of eight members to tampa. this year there will be no epp delegation because no one from the group expressed an interest in attending. despite the wariness, there is a reluctance to criticize the famously thin skinned trump too openly, in part out of fear he could win the election in november and punish his foreign critics, as he threatened to do when david cameron, the recently departed british prime minister, slammed trump’s proposal for a temporary u.s. ban on muslims as “divisive, stupid and wrong”. while the conservative mainstream is leery, europe’s array of nationalist, anti immigration parties seem fascinated by trump, even if some are uneasy about embracing the new york real estate businessman, who has vowed to “make america great again”. a spokesman for britain’s ukip party in brussels confirmed that farage would attend to “give them some lessons” on brexit. and wilders told reuters that he would be in cleveland and wanted to meet trump there. “i hope donald trump becomes america’s next president,” wilders said. “such a victory would be good for europe. america and europe are threatened by the same danger of cultural relativism and islam.” austria’s far right freedom party, france’s national front and the alternative for germany (afd) are not planning to send anyone to cleveland, the parties said. “we are neutral,” freedom party leader heinz christian strache told reuters when asked if he supported trump. “he defends american interests. he is saying some things that need to be said.”also absent will be italy’s northern league, whose leader matteo salvini describes himself as an enthusiastic trump fan but learned earlier this year that the admiration was not necessarily mutual. salvini traveled to pennsylvania in april to attend a trump rally. he was photographed shaking hands with the republican candidate and his party said trump had endorsed salvini to become italian prime minister. but a month later, trump denied in an interview ever having met salvini and said he had no interest in doing so. eirik moen of the international democrat union, which coordinates trips to the convention by center right politicians across the world, said that numbers could be dented this year because countries like britain, spain and australia are in the midst of political transitions, making it difficult for some to travel. still, eight british conservatives who sit in the european parliament are expected to be in cleveland. on the continent, france’s main center right party, les republicains, is not sending a delegation. and the contingent from merkel’s christian democrats (cdu) is unusually small. in germany, political debate is conducted in a sober, reserved manner and personal attacks are rare, even during election campaigns. hence the mix of shock and horror at the tone of the u.s. race. trump has dismissed merkel as “insane” for letting hundreds of thousands of refugees into the country. and his idea to build a wall along the mexican border elicits shudders in berlin, a city that was divided by its own wall for nearly three decades and will celebrate the 27th anniversary of its fall a day after u.s. voters cast their ballots on nov. 8. “many of donald trump’s positions — for example his stance toward muslims, toward immigration from mexico and gun ownership — are simply not compatible with the positions of the conservatives and other parties in germany,” said juergen hardt, a cdu lawmaker who also acts as the government’s coordinator for transatlantic relations. hardt said he is planning to go on vacation with his family next week and won’t be able to attend the convention.

" former canadian prime minister brian mulroney on sunday criticized donald trump’s potential plan to scrap the north american free trade agreement (nafta) and said the u.s. presidential candidate will likely lose the nov. 8 election.  speaking on ctv’s “question period” politics talk show, mulroney, who in the 1980s signed a canada u.s. free trade deal, said scrapping nafta will hurt the united states. “millions and millions of jobs in the united states depend directly upon their trade with canada and mexico,” mulroney said. “you tear that up   my mother used to say, ‘you’re cutting off your nose to spite your face.’” republican presidential nominee trump has railed against the nafta trade deal with canada and mexico as a u.s. job killer, saying that if elected, he would be prepared to scrap it if he could not negotiate much better terms for the united states.  the north american free trade agreement took effect in 1994 during the administration of president bill clinton, the husband of democratic presidential candidate hillary clinton.     trump also has a hardline immigration plan that emphasized deporting illegal immigrants who commit crimes. his proposals include building a wall at the border with mexico. mulroney said that while trump’s rhetoric “carried him through the republican primaries,” he does not think “something that negative carries you to the white house.” trump’s campaign team did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

" a prominent strategist for kenya s opposition who has strongly criticized president uhuru kenyatta and called for some parts of the country to secede was released on monday after being briefly detained on suspicion of inciting violence. kenya s public prosecutor said on twitter that david ndii had been released on police bond and that  appropriate actions  would be taken after investigations are completed.  police had earlier said ndii, an economist and anti corruption campaigner who was arrested on sunday in the coastal town of diani, was  under interrogation regarding ... the offence of incitement to violence . opposition leader raila odinga condemned the arrest, saying on monday:  he has committed no crime. (this is) designed to intimidate and fragment the people of kenya.  pro democracy groups said ndii s arrest raised concerns about freedom of expression.   ndii has been at the forefront of articulating the problems with the way the country is run,  said gladwell otieno, executive director of africa centre for open governance (africog) in nairobi.      ndii is an outspoken critic of kenyatta, who was sworn in for a second presidential term last week after a prolonged elections season that has disrupted the economy and spurred protests that killed more than 60 people.  a senior policy adviser to the opposition national super alliance (nasa), he has called since a disputed august election that was voided by the supreme court for western and coastal areas that are opposition strongholds to declare independence.   odinga, who boycotted a repeat poll in october saying the election commission had failed to carry out sufficient reforms, has said his preference is for kenya to remain united. kenyatta won the re run election with 98 percent of the vote but the country, a western ally in a volatile region, remains deeply divided after months of bitter campaigning and sporadic violent clashes. salim lone, an odinga adviser, said ndii was helping to organize the  swearing in  of odinga by a people s assembly on dec. 12, kenya s independence day, a plan that has raised the prospect of further confrontations with security forces. ndii s wife judith mwende gatabaki told journalists on monday that he was arrested by men who identified themselves as members of the  flying squad    a police unit that is part of the criminal investigation directorate.  she said they searched the couple s hotel room before taking him away and that she had been unable to reach her husband since.     we came here to attend a wedding. there was nothing political about it and my husband is not a criminal,  gatabaki  said.

" republican presidential candidate donald trump is considering nominating oklahoma oil and gas mogul harold hamm as energy secretary if elected to the white house on nov. 8, according to four sources close to trump’s campaign. the chief executive of continental resources (clr.n) would be the first u.s. energy secretary drawn directly from the oil and gas industry since the cabinet position was created in 1977, a move that would jolt environmental advocates but bolster trump’s pro drilling energy platform.  dan eberhart, an oil investor and republican financier, said he had been told by officials in trump’s campaign that hamm, who has been an informal advisor to trump on energy policy since at least may, was “the leading contender” for the position.  eberhart said he had discussed the possible appointment with  top donors at the republican national convention in cleveland this week, where trump was formally nominated as the party’s candidate in the nov. 8 presidential election. three other sources close to the trump campaign confirmed trump was considering hamm for the post. one of the sources said he first heard that hamm was a contender from trump officials on sunday. none of the sources was aware of who else trump may be considering for the job. representatives for trump and hamm did not respond to a request for comment.  addressing the convention on wednesday night, hamm called for expanded drilling and said too much environmental regulation    threatened to limit u.s. oil production and increase the country’s dependence on middle eastern oil producers. “every time we can’t drill a well in america, terrorism is being funded,” hamm told the cheering crowd. “every onerous regulation puts american lives at risk.”     hamm, 70, became one of america’s wealthiest men during the u.s. oil and gas drilling boom over the past decade, tapping into new hydraulic fracturing drilling technology to access vast deposits in north dakota’s shale fields. past heads of the u.s. department of energy, which is charged with advancing u.s. energy security and technology and dealing with nuclear waste disposal, have typically boasted a political or academic background. this is not the first time hamm has been in contention for the job. the republican party’s presidential nominee in 2012, mitt romney, vetted hamm to be energy secretary but ultimately decided against him because the two men have differing positions on renewable energy sources like wind.  he made headlines in 2015 after settling a protracted divorce case and agreeing to pay his ex wife $975 million   reported to be the biggest divorce settlement in history. his fortune is now estimated at nearly $12 billion.   “fracker in chief” trump, who has yet to make any announcements about his prospective cabinet, has already surrounded himself with strong advocates of traditional energy sources like oil, gas, and coal and has promised to gut environmental regulations to boost drilling and mining if elected. he tapped u.s. congressman kevin cramer of north dakota, a climate skeptic and drilling advocate, to help draw up his campaign energy platform, and picked indiana governor mike pence, also a climate skeptic, as his running mate.  both moves cheered the energy industry but alarmed environmental activists who say a trump presidency would set back years of progress on issues like pollution and climate change.  “given that hamm’s as close as we’ve got to a fracker in chief in this country, it would be an apropos pick for a president who thinks global warming is a hoax manufactured by the chinese,” said leading environmental activist bill mckibben.  trump’s democratic rival hillary clinton has promised to bolster regulation and increase use of renewable fuels to combat climate change if elected.

" u.s. republican senator john mccain said on sunday he would subpoena 10 u.s. sailors to testify about their brief detention by iran if the obama administration does not provide the findings of an investigation into the incident by march 1. “it’s an option that i do not want to exercise,” mccain, who chairs the senate armed services committee, told reporters as he was returning to the united states from an international security conference in germany.     the sailors were detained by the islamic revolutionary guard corps after their two patrol boats strayed into iranian waters on jan. 12. u.s. officials later blamed a navigational problem.  the americans were freed the next day after u.s. secretary of state john kerry intervened with iranian foreign minister javad zarif, averting a diplomatic crisis just days before implementation of the iran nuclear deal and the lifting of international sanctions on tehran. iranian media broadcast videos of the detainees, including scenes in which revolutionary guards personnel trained weapons on the sailors as they kneeled. the obama administration has said the sailors’ speedy release showed the power of diplomacy and the promise of its new engagement with iran. the u.s. navy had briefed mccain several times about the incident, and would continue to do so as the investigation proceeded, said one u.s. official. republicans have been critical of the deal with iran, and some say the detainment of the sailors showed how little regard iran had for the united states.     mccain said he had been told the sailors were still being debriefed, but added that he assumed that administration members were “dragging their feet” in completing an investigation into the incident, which he accused iran of exploiting for propaganda purposes.     “i guarantee you, if they don’t have a debrief by the first of march like they said, we’ll have a hearing and we’ll subpoena. we’re not going to wait any longer,” mccain said. “we will subpoena the individuals if we have to.” mccain said he raised the case in a meeting on saturday with kerry on the sidelines of the security conference in munich.

" a democratic u.s. senator pressed deutsche bank (dbkgn.de) on wednesday to release information about issues including president donald trump’s debt and any bank meetings with trump administration officials, saying he had “great concern” about possible conflicts of interest. “i write to you with great concern regarding conflicts of interest between deutsche bank and the president of the united states and how these conflicts may impact ongoing investigations and regulatory oversight of your institution,” senator chris van hollen wrote in a letter addressed to the chief executive of deutsche bank usa, which he released to the public. van hollen is a member of the senate banking committee. a spokeswoman for deutsche bank declined comment. white house officials did not respond to a request for comment. van hollen’s letter said prior financial disclosures listed two loans and two mortgages for which deutsche bank was the lender and trump the borrower. those loans amounted to about $340 million, with another $950 million extended to a venture in which trump owns a 30 percent stake, he wrote. the letter also noted that jared kushner, trump’s son in law and senior adviser, holds a multimillion dollar line of credit at deutsche bank. van hollen asked for a response by may 12.

" the united states wants to cut $1 billion from the total united nations peacekeeping budget for the year from july 1 to shave over 10 percent off washington’s share of the bill following calls by president donald trump for u.s. funding to be slashed. the proposal by the largest u.n. contributor is an opening bid in negotiations by the 193 member general assembly budget committee, which has to agree funding for 13 peacekeeping missions and a logistics support office by the end of june. reuters reviewed a document compiling the peacekeeping budget proposals by states and regional groups. the u.s. proposal of an annual budget of $6.99 billion was the lowest made   nearly $1 billion less than u.n. chief antonio guterres’ proposal and almost $570 million less than the recommendation by the world body’s budget advisory experts. under the u.s. proposal, washington would have to pay $1.99 billion compared with $2.25 billion for the current year. while trump has described u.s. funding for the united nations as “peanuts” compared to its “important work,” he complains its share of the peacekeeping bill, currently 28.5 percent, is “unfair.” in his 2018 budget proposal he requested congress approve only $1.2 billion for u.n. peacekeeping.  this is $1 billion less than the u.s. peacekeeping bill for the 12 months to june 30, 2017, when the total peacekeeping budget was $7.9 billion. washington currently owes $417 million for peacekeeping, u.n. officials said. ultimately the u.s. congress sets the federal government budget and will decide how much money is made available for u.n. peacekeeping. republicans, who control both houses, and democrats have said they do not support drastic cuts proposed by trump. under the u.s. proposal to the u.n. budget committee, the largest cuts would be made to some of the most expensive operations in democratic republic of congo, mali and sudan’s darfur, according to the document seen by reuters. the 193 u.n. member states are working to negotiate a compromise by the end of the month between the u.s. proposal, at the low end of the scale, and the highest suggestion of $7.72 billion by the african group, according to the document. trump also wants to enforce a 25 percent cap on the u.s. contribution to u.n. peacekeeping. the u.n. general assembly is due to negotiate next year new levels of contributions by countries for 2019, 2020 and 2021. the united states also pays 22 percent of the $5.4 billion u.n. core budget. guterres has pledged to make u.n. peacekeeping more efficient but has noted that the current budget to fund it is less than one half of 1 percent of global military spending.

" the obama administration has no immediate need for funding to combat the zika virus because money remains unspent from fighting the two year long ebola outbreak, a member of the republican senate leadership said on tuesday. lawmakers are debating what resources are needed as zika spreads in south and central america and the caribbean and raises fears of the possibility of birth defects.  but while democrats joined with the administration to call for more than $1.8 billion in emergency funding, republicans say there is no need for immediate action and intend to have hearings on capitol hill, including a meeting with u.s. health and human services secretary sylvia burwell on tuesday.   “we all believe this needs to be dealt with,” said senator roy blunt of missouri, who will chair a hearing about zika on thursday.   “there’s still money left that was appropriated for ebola,” blunt told reporters. “so there’s no immediate shortage of money for the administration to do what they think needs to be done.” he said that the centers for disease control and prevention the national institutes of health have received additional funding. most of the money sought by obama would be spent in the united states on testing, surveillance and response. a republican aide said the government had $1.49 billion left in ebola funding as of dec. 31, 2015. the ebola outbreak began  in west africa in december 2013. the cdc received a $272 million increase for 2016, the aide said. officials at the department of health and human services were not immediately available to comment.  democrats rejected the republican agenda of hearings and called for action on obama’s plan. “all the lip service in the world isn’t going to protect america from the zika virus,” said senator charles schumer of new york, the senate’s no. 3 democrat. the world health organization declared the outbreak an international health emergency on feb. 1, citing a “strongly suspected” relationship between zika infection in pregnancy and microcephaly, a condition marked by abnormally small head size that can result in developmental problems.  brazil is investigating more than 4,000 suspected cases of microcephaly and has identified evidence of zika infection in 17 of these cases. but much remains unknown about zika.

" democrat hillary clinton had a four percentage point advantage in support over republican donald trump ahead of their first u.s. presidential debate, according to the latest reuters/ipsos national tracking poll released on friday. the sept. 16 22 opinion poll showed that 41 percent of likely voters supported clinton, while 37 percent supported trump. clinton has mostly led trump in the poll during the 2016 campaign, though her advantage has narrowed since the end of the democratic and republican national conventions in july. with just six weeks before the nov. 8 election, monday’s debate at hofstra university in hempstead, new york will be the first of three between the white house rivals. it presents a major opportunity for them to appeal to voters who have yet to commit to a candidate after a mostly negative race in which clinton and trump have sought to brand each other as untrustworthy and dangerous for the country. the live, televised matchup is expected to draw a super bowl sized television audience of 100 million americans, according to some commentators. among those watching will be people who so far remain on the fence. this could be a sizable group: some 22 percent of likely voters said in the latest poll that they do not support either major party candidate. that was more than twice the proportion of uncommitted voters at the same point in the 2012 election between democratic president barack obama and republican mitt romney. these uncommitted voters appear to be leaning more toward trump than clinton, according to the latest poll, though they have not been convinced enough to say they will vote for him in november. it was also possible that some of these voters would pick an alternative party candidate like libertarian gary johnson or the green party’s jill stein. clinton led a separate four way poll that included trump, johnson and stein. among likely voters, 39 percent supported clinton, 37 percent favored trump, 7 percent picked johnson and 2 percent supported stein. the reuters/ipsos poll is conducted online in english in the continental united states, alaska and hawaii. it included 1,559 respondents who were considered to be likely voters given their voting history, registration status and stated intention to show up on election day. it has a credibility interval, a measure of accuracy, of 3 percentage points, meaning results could vary by that much either way. national polls have produced varying measurements of support for clinton and trump during the 2016 campaign. the differences are partly due to the fact that some polls, like reuters/ipsos, try to include only likely voters, while others include all registered voters. the reuters/ipsos tracking poll gathers responses every day and reports results twice a week, so it often detects trends in sentiment before most other polls.  polling aggregators, which calculate averages of major polls, have shown that clinton’s lead over trump has been shrinking this month. the most recent individual polls put her advantage at 3 percentage points.

" ivanka trump was booed in berlin on tuesday when she described her father donald as a “tremendous champion of supporting families” and said she was still fine tuning her role as first daughter and informal white house adviser.  trump, 35, who is seen as an increasingly important influence on her father, told a women’s summit organised by the group of 20 major economies in the german capital that she wanted to use her influence to help empower women. asked whether she represented the president, the american people or her business as first daughter, she replied: “well certainly not the latter, and i am rather unfamiliar with this role ... it has been a little under 100 days but it has just been a remarkable and incredible journey.” ivanka trump’s appointment as an adviser, with access to classified information, was highly unusual for the daughter of a president. seeking to allay ethics concerns, she said last month she would serve in the white house in an unpaid, informal role.     in berlin, she discussed support for women entrepreneurs with german chancellor angela merkel and international monetary fund chief christine lagarde among others. “i’m listening, i’m learning, i’m defining the ways in which i think that i’ll be able to have impact,” she told the panel discussion.  “i’m seeking the counsel .. . of informed and thoughtful women and men and i’m really striving to think about how best to empower women in the economy, both domestically and across the globe.” but the audience was unsympathetic when she called her father a “tremendous champion of supporting families and enabling them to thrive”, with the moderator moving the discussion on amid a chorus of boos. donald trump found himself at the centre of a furious controversy during the presidential campaign when a video surfaced in which he boasted about grabbing women’s genitals. asked whether some of the attitudes expressed by her father raised questions over his commitment to empowering women, ivanka trump said her experience and that of thousands of women who had worked for him showed he believed in women’s potential. “i grew up in a house where there were no barriers to what i could accomplish ... there was no difference for me and my brothers and i think as a business leader you saw that and as a president you’ll absolutely see that,” she said.  during the berlin discussion, donald trump tweeted a link to a financial times editorial ivanka co authored with world bank president jim yong kim on investment in women and said he was “proud” of his daughter for “her leadership on these important issues”. ivanka trump’s visit has received a mixed response in german media. the newspaper berliner zeitung, which has described her as “the president’s whisperer”, said german officials would “certainly be hoping that the president’s daughter will convey a positive image of germany to her father”.  another paper, tagesspiegel, was more sniffy about her credentials, opining that trump’s dependence on family members    also including her husband jared kushner, a chief presidential adviser   was like a “vote of no confidence” in everyone else he was surrounded by.

" donald trump and vladimir putin have an opportunity to mend their countries’ ties when they meet next week, former top u.s. diplomat henry kissinger said on friday, a day after he followed up a meeting with the u.s. president by having talks with putin. expectations that trump’s election would bring a thaw in icy relations between moscow and washington have been put on hold, with the white house embroiled in a domestic row over trump associates’ russia ties.  the u.s. and russian leaders are to have their first face to face encounter next week at a g20 summit in hamburg. at a previous moment of heightened tension between moscow and washington, in the 1960s, kissinger acted as a back channel intermediary, passing messages to the leadership of the soviet union on behalf of u.s. president richard nixon. the kremlin on friday denied that kissinger, who is visiting moscow and met putin behind closed doors on thursday, was acting as a go between this time. speaking at an international affairs conference in moscow, kissinger said of the planned trump putin meeting: “i believe that at this moment our two countries have a responsibility, and an opportunity, to make significant progress not just by improving relations, but by improving situations around the world through cooperative efforts.” “tensions between russia and the united states ... have happened often before and they have been overcome often before,” kissinger, 94, said. he did not take questions from reporters at the event. asked if kissinger was providing a back channel between the kremlin and the white house, kremlin spokesman dmitry peskov said: “he didn’t try. that did not happen.” he said the kissinger putin meeting was strictly private and declined to disclose what the two men talked about. in may, trump granted a white house audience to kissinger. the u.s. leader said he and kissinger would talk about russia, among other issues. speaking at the same moscow event as kissinger on friday, russian foreign minister sergei lavrov said that the significance of the planned putin trump hamburg meeting was that “the abnormal period in our relations when the leaders only speak by telephone will be overcome.” “judging by their telephone conversations, they have a desire to get beyond this abnormality and start seeking agreement on specific issues.” ",0

" a group advising u.s. president donald trump on infrastructure has proposed an arbitration style pilot program to slash the current 10 years it often takes to break ground on projects, without short changing environmental standards. the group, led by billionaire new york real estate developers richard lefrak and steve roth, made the suggestion to trump and others in the white house last week, lefrak told reuters on monday. builders, unions and others often rue a permitting processes that can last a decade or more – a potential snag in trump’s plan to launch a 10 year, $1 trillion infrastructure building program to create jobs and bolster the world’s biggest economy. lefrak said the advisory council is looking at a pilot program comparable to the arbitration process used in bankruptcy court to speed up proposals, reduce red tape and halt litigation that can tie up infrastructure projects in court for years. “somebody in authority would make the decisions, all the mitigation that should be coming out of it, whether it’s environmental mitigation, other mitigation, gets decided at that moment and that’s it,” he said. “it’s just a proposal. we’re asking them to try it.” the council is not empowered to pick projects or make decisions about how to streamline the project permitting process for projects, he said. any pilot program would be up to state and federal officials and congress, he said. lefrak added that the proposal would not allow projects for bridges, roads or airports to side step regulations, such as environmental rules. the idea would be to hammer out differences and objections faster in an arbitration like setting so that projects could get underway in less time.  australia, canada and germany typically take two years to approve infrastructure projects compared with 10 years in the united states, he said. a shortened review process could leave projects open to worries from environmentalists and others that an expedited permitting system could short change environmental protections. environmental groups are skeptical of trump’s promise to overhaul government regulations without jeopardizing america’s water and air quality. when trump unveils his budget on thursday, he is expected to slash the budget of the environmental protection agency by 25 percent. the sierra club, nature conservancy and other environmental groups as well as the office of house of representatives democratic leader nancy pelosi were not available for comment.  permitting and other regulatory hurdles can delay projects for years, a potential liability for a program that seeks to put money – and people – to work immediately. “there’s got to be some way without abrogating anybody’s rights to get all this on the table much more quickly,” said lefrak, who is chairman and chief executive of the lefrak organization, a leading developer and property owner in the new york metro area and south florida.  lefrak pointed to the replacement within 14 months of a bridge that collapsed in minneapolis in 2007 killing 13 people as an example of how projects can get done without compromising standards. lefrak also said the committee wants to use private funds to soak up cost overruns and keep projects maintained after completion. he suggested, as well, one possible solution to the key question of how to pay for trump’s infrastructure program: a higher federal gas tax.  if not, funding will have to come from general tax revenue, he said. local and state government pay for about 70 percent of infrastructure projects in the united states, with the remainder funded by the federal government.  the american society of civil engineers last week recommended an 18.4 cents per gallon federal tax on gasoline be raised at least to 25 cents per gallon to fill a funding deficit for infrastructure it said was $2 trillion. “i’m saying somebody’s going to have pay for it. it doesn’t come for free,” lefrak said. “i wish i was powerful enough to impose a gas tax, but i’m not.” ",0

" a federal judge on wednesday authorized a new plan allowing protesters at next month’s republican national convention in cleveland to demonstrate in an area that will be readily visible to convention goers. the new plan, approved by u.s. district judge dan aaron polster, also cuts in half the size of an “event zone” where demonstrations and mobility will be limited and gives protesters more time to demonstrate. the agreement between the city of cleveland and the american civil liberties union resolves weeks of wrangling over the rules for what are expected to be lively protests when donald trump is due to become the republican party’s official nominee for president at the july 18 21 convention. trump campaign events have drawn raucous demonstrations,  with some resulting in clashes between his supporters and opponents. “this settlement is a significant improvement from what the city had previously offered,” christine link, executive director for the aclu of ohio, said in a statement. the aclu sued on behalf of three groups planning to organize thousands of demonstrators, calling the rules too restrictive. dan williams, spokesman for cleveland mayor frank jackson, described the changes as “minor” and said he did not believe there would be an increased security risk as a result. cleveland originally planned to cordon off 3.3 square miles (8.5 square km) around the convention site as an event zone where free speech mobility would be limited.  after another federal judge struck down the city’s original plan, the two sides settled the lawsuit on friday and took several days to work out details before revealing the new plan. the event zone is now 1.7 square miles (4.4 square km). the new zone frees up parkland where demonstrators will be able to organize before their protests. it also removes the port of cleveland and a small public airport for corporate jets and air taxi services from the restricted area. the main parade route for demonstrators now extends deeper into central cleveland and will be more visible from the sports arena where the main event will take place, and more within the view of delegates and the media. the previous route took demonstrators further away from the center of town and over a bridge where they would be seen primarily by themselves. in addition, groups were granted extra staging time between protests. the aclu filed the lawsuit on behalf of citizens for trump, a texas based group that supports the businessman’s campaign; organize ohio, a liberal activist group; and northeast ohio coalition for the homeless, a charitable organization.

" u.s. vice president mike pence on saturday urged the republican controlled congress to complete the job of dismantling obamacare this summer and move on quickly to another big ticket item on president donald trump’s agenda: tax cuts. speaking days before lawmakers return to washington amid doubts about their ability to agree on legislation, pence sought to add urgency to the debate by warning that consumers face dwindling access to obamacare health coverage in some states. trump backed legislation to dismantle former president barack obama’s healthcare overhaul narrowly passed the house of representatives last month. but senate republicans have had difficulty agreeing on their own bill, leading senate majority leader mitch mcconnell to fret about the future of healthcare legislation.  “first and foremost, this summer, this congress must come together and heed the president’s leadership, and we must repeal and replace obamacare,” pence told a political rally in iowa, one of several states where major insurers have exited government subsidized insurance markets. “it’s high time we take action,” the vice president added, saying congress must “relieve iowa and relieve america.”   insurers say they cannot plan amid the uncertainty  surrounding healthcare legislation. they also face a worse than expected balance of sick and healthy customers that has helped drive insurance premiums higher in obamacare marketplaces. “once we repeal and replace obamacare, we’re going to roll our sleeves up, and working with these great leaders in congress, we’re going to pass one of the largest tax cuts in american history,” pence said. a former indiana congressman, pence plays a key role in trump’s relationship with lawmakers as the main white house liaison to congress. as vice president, he also casts the tie breaking vote on legislation in the 100 member senate, where republicans have a slim 52 seat majority.   senate republican staff are expected to present legislative options on healthcare when lawmakers return to capitol hill on monday after a one week recess, according to aides. but some republicans are skeptical that healthcare legislation can pass the senate this summer, if at all. pence projected confidence that congress will succeed: “i know we will. the obamacare nightmare is about to end.”  ",0

" an israeli ex soldier who serves as a spokesman for a group that documents alleged abuses of palestinians has set off a legal tussle with the israeli authorities by saying he himself beat a detainee. after dean issacharoff, a former army lieutenant, spoke of the incident in a speech uploaded to youtube in april, the israeli justice ministry took the unusual move of launching an investigation, with him as a suspect. issacharoff, the son of a senior diplomat, belongs to breaking the silence, a circle of army veterans that has long angered israeli leaders by publicising abroad what it says are   confessions of war crimes in occupied palestinian territory. the group portrayed as another example of israeli military excess issacharoff s account of what he said was his own beating of a palestinian stone thrower in the west bank town of hebron while trying to handcuff him in 2014. but the justice ministry last week declared the case closed, saying questioning of the alleged palestinian victim showed the event had never happened and that issacharoff had made a  mendacious claim . on twitter, prime minister benjamin netanyahu celebrated the decision as  further proof breaking the silence lies and slanders our soldiers . issacharoff retorted on social media that the ministry had questioned the wrong palestinian   a man he had detained separately in hebron around the same time. breaking the silence issued what it said was video of the right incident, showing issacharoff frog marching a handcuffed man. the palestinian appears to have dark patches on his cheeks, which the group said were bruises from issacharoff having kneed him. issacharoff said he bloodied the palestinian, though no blood is seen on the detainee in the footage. achiya schatz, another breaking the silence spokesman,  accused the justice ministry of clearing issacharoff in order to discredit the group.  this was a politicised investigation, made to order for the elimination of opposition (voices),  schatz said. prosecutor nurit littman denied any bias and said  issacharoff s testimony had been too sketchy to produce corroboration.  we do not dabble in politics. we deal in evidence,  she told army radio, leaving open the possibility of a new investigation taking into consideration the new video.  interviewed on israeli television, the palestinian, faisal al natsheh, said he had been detained though he had not thrown stones, and had been beaten by troops. he could not confirm issacharoff was among them.  they didn t let me look at them, not even once,  he said.

" u.s. president donald trump on tuesday blasted the investigation into alleged russian meddling in last year’s u.s. election and raised questions, without offering evidence, about ukrainian   support for his democratic presidential rival, hillary clinton. in a pair of early morning tweets, trump also said u.s. attorney general jeff sessions had “taken a very weak position” toward the democratic presidential nominee and cited “ukrainian efforts to sabotage trump campaign   quietly working to boost clinton’.” trump did not elaborate or offer evidence about any role ukraine may have played in the 2016 election. the republican president’s first six months in office have been shadowed by investigations into possible russian interference in the election and possible ties between his campaign and moscow. the ukrainian president’s spokesman did not respond immediately to a request for comment. the ukrainian embassy in washington denied kiev had tried to influence the u.s. election. “we stand by our words that the government of ukraine didn’t help any candidate in (the) election. ukraine is proud of bipartisan support in the u.s.,” the embassy posted on twitter. ukraine’s permanent representative to the council of europe, dmytro kuleba, said on twitter: “trump writes that we interfered in the elections in the usa, while putin says that we threaten russia. there was a time when we were peaceful buckwheat sowers who kept themselves to themselves.” the u.s. intelligence community determined that russia attempted to interfere in the white house race. moscow has denied it and trump has said his campaign did not collude with russia. the allegations are being investigated by u.s. congressional committees and a federal special counsel. in the run up to the november election, the fbi probed clinton’s handling of email as u.s. secretary of state under democratic president barack obama but ultimately said no criminal charges were warranted.

" the size of russia s military force in syria is likely to be significantly reduced and a drawdown could start before the end of the year, the chief of the russian military general staff said on thursday. russia s military support of syrian president bashar al assad, notably through air strikes, has been crucial in defeating islamic state and syrian opposition forces.  there is very little left to do before the completion of military objectives. of course, a decision will be made by the supreme commander in chief and the deployment will be reduced,  valery gerasimov told reporters on the sidelines of a meeting between president vladimir putin and military top brass in the black sea resort of sochi. gerasimov said forces would likely be  substantially  reduced but leave russia with two military bases, a ceasefire monitoring center and  a number of necessary structures to support the situation which has developed  in syria.   putin hosted assad in sochi on monday and discussed moving from military operations to a search for a political solution to syria s conflict.

" germany said on friday it had ordered a second vietnamese embassy official to leave the country, after the alleged kidnapping of a vietnamese businessman who had applied for asylum and was facing corruption allegations back home. germany last month accused vietnam s intelligence agency of kidnapping trinh xuan thanh, who is wanted in the southeast asian country on charges of financial mismanagement that caused losses of around $150 million. officials at vietnam s ministry of foreign affairs were not immediately available for comment on friday. vietnam last month denied the accusations and said thanh had returned home voluntarily.  we have also declared a second employee of the vietnamese embassy persona non grata,  a spokesman for the german foreign ministry said in a statement.   he now has four weeks to leave germany with his family.  the foreign ministry also said german officials had informed the vietnamese ambassador on thursday that germany was temporarily suspending the strategic relationship between the two countries. it added that vietnam had not complied with demands to make an apology and provide assurances such incidents that broke german and international laws would not happen again. federal prosecutors in august took over an investigation into the alleged kidnapping, citing new evidence that thanh and a companion were likely taken to the vietnamese embassy in berlin before going back to vietnam.  german media reported last month thanh had been taken from the tiergarten, a large forested park in central berlin, by armed men on july 23. foreign minister sigmar gabriel said in august he had been  taken out of germany using methods which we believe one sees in thriller films about the cold war . czech authorities have arrested and extradited to germany a vietnamese intelligence agent suspected of involvement. berlin and hanoi in 2011 signed a strategic partnership declaration seeking to strengthen economic, political and cultural ties. germany is vietnam s main trading partner in the european union.

" european parliamentarians want britain to end  regrettable  practices that discriminate against eu citizens in the workplace and elsewhere, a draft resolution published on thursday showed.  lawmakers also urged british authorities to grant broad rights to eu citizens and their families in britain after it exits the eu in 2019, an issue where eu chief negotiator michel barnier said on thursday big differences remained. the european parliament  expresses concern about regrettable administrative practices against eu citizens living in the united kingdom , the draft resolution said.  lawmakers said there were also cases of british citizens discriminated against in other eu countries. the british government said on sept. 9 that its equalities office (geo) was  aware of, and is looking into, reports of discrimination against non uk eu nationals seeking employment  in violation of the 2010 equality act. the document, agreed on thursday by the leaders of the assembly s political parties, will be voted on by the chamber next week in strasbourg. the document is not binding on eu negotiators but the 28 nation parliament has the right to veto any deal with britain on its future relations with the eu. mps also urged britain to protect the rights of eu citizens and their children even if they are born there after brexit.  future family members should continue to benefit from right of residence under the same provisions as current family members,  the document said. eu lawmakers have opposed britain s proposals to create a new category of  settled status  under united kingdom immigration law for eu citizens. differences on these issues remain, barnier said on thursday at the end of a fourth round of brexit negotiations. without sufficient progress on citizens  rights, the eu will not move on to negotiations on a future trade deal with london.

" republican presidential front runner donald trump tried to put a difficult week behind him and rally his supporters on monday ahead of a crucial nominating contest in wisconsin, where he was in the unfamiliar position of underdog. opinion polls show trump trailing u.s. senator ted cruz of texas in the midwestern state, where a loss on tuesday could dent the new york billionaire’s aura of inevitability and make it harder for him to win the 1,237 delegates needed for the party’s nomination for the nov. 8 election. trump hunted for support at two rallies in the state on monday, telling voters in la crosse, wisconsin, they could propel him toward the nomination by delivering him a surprise victory over cruz. “if we do well here, folks, it’s over,” trump said. “this could be the real beginning. if it’s not, i think we get there anyway, and i’m pretty sure we get there anyway.” trump said an array of forces were aligned against him in wisconsin, including the state’s governor, scott walker, who has backed cruz, a “very hostile media” and party establishment figures worried he will lead republicans to a broad defeat in november. he ridiculed the “nevertrump” movement to block his nomination and said the party establishment should have put the same effort into beating democratic president barack obama in 2008 and 2012. “if they had worked this hard to stop obama, obama wouldn’t have had a chance,” trump said at a rally in superior, wisconsin. he also said it was “unfair” that rival john kasich, the governor of ohio, refused to get out of the race despite trailing trump and cruz badly. trump has won 736 delegates to the july nominating convention in cleveland, but is still 501 short of the majority he needs to clinch the nomination. rivals cruz and kasich hope to stop him short of a first ballot victory and trigger a contested convention. “my eyes are wide open,” trump said of the possibility the party establishment would maneuver to deny him the nomination at the convention. “we’re dealing with a corrupt system. we’re dealing with a system that is not fair.” cruz told reporters the party was beginning to rally behind him, and said a win in wisconsin would spark a surge of momentum for him in upcoming contests. “what we’re seeing is the party unifying behind our campaign,” cruz said in madison. “i hope and believe tomorrow night’s going to be a very good night here in wisconsin.” a trump loss would cap a rough week, including an avalanche of criticism for his suggestion, which he later dialed back, that women be punished for getting abortions if the procedure is banned. uncharacteristically, trump also acknowledged that he made a mistake retweeting an attack on cruz’s wife, according to the new york times. he also drew fire last week for saying he would not rule out using nuclear weapons in europe and that japan and south korea might need their own nuclear arsenals to ease the u.s. financial commitment to their security. trump told the crowd in superior he had been advised that he should act more presidential but that if he did, it would be boring and “only about 20 percent of you would be here.” cruz was eager to capitalize on trump’s missteps, talking about his family during a town hall session in an attempt to soften his strident image and appeal to women turned off by trump’s recent comments. at a later rally, cruz told voters the entire country was looking toward wisconsin. “let’s show the country that this race is not about yelling and screaming and insults,” he said in madison. even with a victory in wisconsin, cruz faces difficult odds to win the delegates needed to secure the nomination, given that the next states to vote, including new york on april 19 and five northeastern states on april 26, are more trump friendly territory. cruz has 463 delegates, 774 short of the total needed for the nomination, according to an associated press count. kasich, with 143 delegates, has no chance to gather enough delegates to win on the first ballot but has refused to end his candidacy. he rejected trump’s call for him to get out of the race and poked fun at the front runner’s complaints. “i’ve got news for him. i’m gonna get a heck of a lot of his voters,” he told a town hall meeting in hempstead, new york. “i know how to fix these things that the trump voters care about.” in the democratic race, u.s. senator bernie sanders of vermont has a small lead in opinion polls in wisconsin over front runner hillary clinton and is trying to add to his momentum after winning five of the last six contests. a wisconsin win by sanders would put the focus on the april 19 contest in new york, where clinton was campaigning on monday. sanders still faces a tough task to overcome clinton’s lead of 263 pledged delegates in the democratic race, which awards all delegates proportionally to their vote totals in each state. after days of sparring over the date for their next debate, clinton and sanders have agreed to hold the event on april 14 in brooklyn, new york.   clinton reported on monday that she had raised $29.5 million in march for the primary campaign, trailing the $44 million sanders reported raising in march. clinton’s campaign said she raised an additional $6.1 million for the democratic national committee and state parties. at a new york city event celebrating a hike in the state minimum wage to $15 an hour, clinton noted trump had said wages were too high. that drew boos from the crowd, which included a large number of labor union members. “i don’t know what the calculation is by trump and others but i’ll tell you this: they are selling americans short,” clinton said.

" the european commission on wednesday stepped up legal action against hungary over restrictions on foreign funding likely to affect civil society groups funded by the billionaire investor george soros. the eu executive believes the law, passed in june, violates the right to freedom of association and to protection of private life and personal data enshrined in the eu s charter of fundamental rights, as well as breaching the principle of free movement of capital. hungary s right wing prime minister, viktor orban, has long criticized organizations funded by the hungarian born soros, accusing them of working as paid activists advocating soros s political goals, notably by opposing orban s tough immigration policy. when soros in june praised the  courageous way hungarians have resisted the deception and corruption of the mafia state orban has established , orban called it a  declaration of war , and accused soros of running a mafia like network. the commission expressed its concerns over the law on non governmental organizations (ngos) to budapest in july, the latest in a long line of grievances about what brussels and many member states see as a track record of flouting fundamental eu values.  having carefully analyzed the explanations put forward by hungary, the european commission concludes that its serious concerns have not been addressed,  it said in wednesday s statement. the commission s next step in the  infringement procedure  is to issue a so called reasoned opinion, giving hungary one month to take the requested measures.  if hungary fails to reply satisfactorily to the reasoned opinion, then the commission may refer the case to the court of justice of the eu,  the statement said. the commission has already issued a similar ultimatum to hungary over an education law that brussels says infringes academic freedom and could result in the closure of a budapest university founded by soros. since coming to power in 2010, orban has eliminated checks on his power by taking control of much of hungary s media, curbing the powers of the constitutional court and placing loyalists in top positions at public institutions. while brussels can open cases against eu states violating common rules, they are lengthy and often have little impact. that means the eu executive has little leverage over orban, who has been in office since 2010 and faces an election next year.

" the u.s. house of representatives ethics committee has begun a sweeping probe into possible sexual harassment and discrimination by the chamber’s 434 lawmakers and their staff, requesting on friday a wide range of documents from the congressional office that handles employment disputes.  in a letter to the office, susan brooks, the committee’s republican chair, and theodore deutch, its senior democrat, requested the congressional compliance office promptly share all its records “related to any claims of sexual harassment, discrimination, retaliation or any other employment practice.” capitol hill has been rocked this fall by news of possible sexual misconduct by lawmakers, and outrage that public money may have been paid to settle harassment suits against lawmakers. most notably representative john conyers, a michigan democrat, is under pressure to resign in light of sexual harassment allegations, which reuters has not verified. u.s. media have reported conyers used public funds to settle a claim with a woman, and the ethics committee is currently investigating if he “used official resources for impermissible personal purposes.” conyers has acknowledged settling with a former staffer over her claims of harassment, but he has denied wrongdoing.  meanwhile, texas republican representative joe barton recently decided not to seek re election after a nude photo of him appeared on the internet. the committee had no comment beyond the letter. pressure is mounting for it to ramp up its enforcement of congressional rules. it last took a disciplinary action on aug. 1, determining representative ben ray lujan broke a rule on campaign communications but not imposing any sanctions. along with resolving disputes and enforcing employment laws for more than 30,000 people working for congress, the compliance office provides public money to confidentially settle claims against lawmakers. a bipartisan group of lawmakers is seeking to change that practice with legislation that would require prompt public disclosure of settlement awards. in a letter sent to house administration committee chair gregg harper on friday, the compliance office said that since 2013 it has paid settlements on two claims including sex discrimination allegations and one alleging sexual harassment.  it paid $84,000 for one sexual harassment claim and $7,000 in one case alleging both sex and religious discrimination.  politico reported the harassment award was made on behalf of texas republican blake farenthold.  “while i 100 percent support more transparency with respect to claims against members of congress, i can neither confirm nor deny that settlement involved my office as the congressional accountability act prohibits me from answering that question,” said farenthold in a statement.  in 2014 farenthold’s former communications director lauren greene sued him, alleging a hostile work environment, gender discrimination, and retaliation, court documents show. farenthold and greene reached a mediated agreement in 2015 to avoid costly litigation, but the settlement’s details were confidential, according to a statement released at the time, where farenthold denied engaging in any wrongdoing.

" a bomb blast killed eight people and injured 16 others on a bus in syria s homs on tuesday, state media said, citing the city s health authority. islamic state claimed the attack, saying the blast killed 11 members of the syrian army, its official news agency amaq said. many of the passengers were university students, homs governor talal barazi told state run ikhbariya tv. the blast in the government held city hit the akrama district, near al baath university.  footage showed people crowding around the burned shell of a vehicle in the middle of a street. state television said  a bomb that terrorists planted in a passenger bus exploded .  islamic state militants had claimed responsibility for a similar attack in homs in may, when a car bomb killed four people and injured 32 others.  a string of bombings have struck cities under government control in syria this year, including the capital damascus.  the tahrir al sham alliance   led by fighters formerly linked to al qaeda   has also claimed some of the deadly attacks.  security agencies are constantly chasing sleeper cells,  the homs police chief said on ikhbariya.  today, it could be a sleeper cell or it could be an infiltration.  barazi, the governor, said the state s enemies were trying to target stability as  the stage of victory  drew near.  the city of homs returned to full government control in may for the first time since the onset of syria s conflict more than six years ago. with the help of russian jets and iran backed militias, the damascus government has pushed back rebel factions in western syria, shoring up its rule over the main urban centers. the army and allied forces then marched eastwards against islamic state militants this year. the united states has voiced concern about syrian and russian attacks. the u.s. state department on tuesday strongly condemned attacks this week on eastern ghouta believed to have been carried out by syrian and russian jets. the jets struck crowded residential areas in the besieged rebel enclave near damascus on sunday, killing at least 27 people, aid workers and a war monitor said.   deliberate tactics to starve syrian civilians, including women and children, block humanitarian and medical aid, bomb hospitals, medical personnel and first responders in eastern ghouta, we consider that to be deeply troubling,  state department spokeswoman heather nauert said. she urged russia to live up to its obligations to uphold the de escalation zone in eastern ghouta.

" a prominent iraqi militia indicated on thursday it would give any heavy weapons it had to the military once islamic state was defeated and rejected a proposed u.s. congressional bill designating it a terrorist group. harakat hezbollah al nujaba, which has about 10,000 fighters, is one of the most important militias in iraq. though made up of iraqis, it is loyal to iran and is helping tehran create a supply route through iraq to damascus. the nujaba fights under the umbrella of the popular mobilization forces (pmf), a mostly iranian backed coalition of shi ite militias that played a role in combating islamic state. disarming the pmf is seen as prime minister haider al abadi s most difficult test as iraqi forces edge closer to declaring victory over the sunni militants.  the heavy weapons belong to the iraqi government, not us. we are not rebels or agents of chaos and we do not want to be a state within a state,  hashim al mouasawi, the group s spokesman, said at a news conference on thursday. he was responding to a reuters question on whether his group would obey orders by abadi, who as prime minister commands the military, to return heavy weaponry, reduce the number of fighters, or withdraw from syria. he would not be drawn on the reduction of fighters or syria.  the pmf is under the command of the commander in chief of the armed forces and naturally when the war is over and victory is declared, the final decision will be his,  mouasawi said. his comments broadly echoed those of iraqi military spokesman brigadier general yahya rasool.  the tanks, armored vehicles, and machine guns belong to the army and it is natural that after the battles are over they return to the army,  rasool told reuters in an interview. nujaba strongly objected to moves by washington towards designating it a terrorist group. nujaba blames the united states, without providing evidence, for the creation of is. republican u.s. representative ted poe introduced a bill this month to the house of representatives that would place nujaba and another militia loyal to iran on a list of terrorist groups and give president donald trump 90 days to impose sanctions on it once it passed.  the bill was referred to the house committee on foreign affairs, sparking condemnation in baghdad from iraqi lawmakers and abadi himself, who said he would not allow anyone who fought islamic state to be treated as criminals.  accusing us of terrorism is not new or surprising. it is not a coincidence, and does not shock us, because we have never been part of the american bloc or project,  said mouasawi. iraq is backed by adversaries the united states and iran in its fight against islamic state. the united states is concerned that iran, a shi ite muslim regional power, will take advantage of gains against islamic state in iraq and syria to expand the influence it amassed after the u.s. invasion in 2003, something sunni arab rivals such as saudi arabia also oppose. tens of thousands of iraqis heeded a call to arms in 2014 after islamic state seized a third of the country s territory, forming the pmf, which receive funding and training from tehran and have been declared part of the iraqi security apparatus. they are paid by the iraqi government and officially report to the prime minister, but some arab sunni and kurdish politicians describe these militias as a de facto branch of the iran s islamic revolutionary guards corp (irgc). mouasawi openly said on thursday his group receives support in the form of  advice  from the guards and the commander of its foreign operations, major general qassem soleimani, and lebanese shi ite political and military group hezbollah.

" north carolina’s republican dominated legislature passed a series of measures on friday to curtail the executive authority of democratic governor elect roy cooper just weeks before he is to succeed a republican in the executive mansion. the bills, passed in the last hours of a special “lame duck” session called to help victims of hurricane matthew, strip the governor from the power to make cabinet appointments without senate confirmation, name people to be trustees of the university of north carolina and the ability to control hiring for about 1,200 state employees. “what is happening now may look like partisan political games, but the result will hurt north carolinians,” cooper said on twitter friday. he has threatened to sue the republican dominated legislature and the outgoing republican governor, adding that “the courts will have to clean up the mess the legislature made.” cooper beat incumbent republican governor pat mccrory by a razor thin 10,000 vote margin in a hard fought election whose results took a full month to count before a winner was announced dec. 8. mccrory on friday signed one of the measures, lessening the governor’s control over the state elections board, and is expected to approve the latest actions before turning over the weakened office to cooper on jan. 7. republican lawmakers called the changes justified by the state’s constitution and meant as a check on executive power. “this bill is a good step forward in reasserting legislative authority vested by the constitution and entrusted to the members of this body,” representative david lewis, a republican and a sponsor of the bill, said during debate on thursday. the legislation and related bills came as a surprise, filed late on wednesday on the heels of a special session of the general assembly called to consider relief for hurricane matthew victims. their introduction and passage led to protests in both house and senate chambers.  “the process, the content the intention of these bills, they are an affront to the values of our democracy,” said ticie rhodes, 57, of raleigh, retired teacher and counselor who was protesting with her church. thirty nine protesters were arrested on friday, including a man in a santa claus suit, raleigh television station wral reported. reuters was not able to immediately reach general assembly police chief martin brock for comment.  mccrory praised the elections bill on friday, saying it “lays important groundwork to ensure a fair and ethical election process in north carolina.” but cooper has said they would curtail his ability to improve health care, education and the environment for north carolinians.

" the u.s. power sector’s shift toward burning less coal and using more natural gas and renewable energy will not be derailed by the supreme court ruling against the obama administration’s limits on carbon emissions, state regulators and utilities said on wednesday. the u.s. supreme court decided 5 4 on tuesday to block the environmental protection agency’s carbon emissions crackdown on coal plants until a legal challenge is resolved.  some states may now slow work on compliance with the epa’s clean power plan. but some experts said they were confident the rule will survive the legal challenge when the d.c. circuit court makes a decision this summer.  “in a way we are really just postponing the inevitable,” said vicki arroyo, executive director of the georgetown climate center. even in some of the 27 states that sued to block the rule, officials had been working on compliance plans.  most states said they will continue to decarbonize their energy supply. utilities across the country have already begun a major shift away from coal fired electricity toward cleaner burning and cheaper natural gas and renewables like wind and solar. “we fully expect that many of these states will continue their efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions under their own legal authorities,” said bill becker, director of the national association of clean air agencies.  states like california, colorado and new york criticized the high court’s decision and vowed to pursue their plans to shift to cleaner energy regardless of the delay in the epa rule. meanwhile, states like montana and north dakota that joined in the lawsuit against the epa welcomed the “breathing room” the stay provides. but even these opponents of the rule said they will keep diversifying their power supply. colorado’s democratic governor john hickenlooper said the state will keep working on compliance so it “is not left at a disadvantage if the courts uphold all or part of the clean power plan.” colorado challenged the epa plan even though the governor supports it. the state’s republican attorney general disagrees about the legality of the rule and its economic impact. montana governor steve bullock, a democrat, opposed the epa rule. he said the state would put on hold the work of a group to devise compliance options, but added that it still needs “to address climate change and embrace montana’s energy future.” he said: “i am committed to ensuring we do so on our own terms.”   for coal producing north dakota, which had one of the highest emission reduction targets to meet under the rule, regulators and utilities will keep working on ways to lower power plant emissions, said state health department chief dave glatt.  he said the epa plan did not give the state “a sufficient amount of time to have reasonable solutions.” he pledged to “look at reasonable steps forward.” for most states, coal fired electricity has been in decline. in 2015, generators shut over 15,000 megawatts of coal fired power plants, the most in any year, as low gas prices drove down power costs. it became uneconomical to overhaul older coal plants even to meet existing federal clean air rules.  ohio regulators said wednesday they were not sure how the state will respond to the court decision, but the state’s major utilities are already shifting away from coal. american electric power co inc (aep.n) will continue generating more power with natural gas and renewable energy since prices for those have dropped significantly, said spokeswoman melissa mchenry. she added that the five year extension of federal renewable energy tax credits has given aep an incentive to bring more renewable energy into the mix. “it makes sense that we are sticking to our current plans, and will be positioned to respond to the courts’ ultimate decision on the future of the clean power plan,” she said. another ohio utility, firstenergy corp (fe.n), said it already retired a number of older coal plants in 2012. the court decision will have little impact. “the supreme court decision does not change the path we are on,” said spokeswoman jennifer young. “we think it is the right thing to do – this is a complicated issue and this decision will give the states the appropriate amount of time to develop their compliance plans.” ",0
" president barack obama on sunday described the worst mass shooting in u.s. history as “an act of terror” and “an act of hate,” saying the massacre of 50 people at a packed gay nightclub in orlando, florida was an attack on all americans. “today as americans we grieve the brutal murder, a horrific massacre of dozens of innocent people,” he said in a statement at the white house.  “although it is still early in the investigation, we know enough to say that this was an act of terror and an act of hate,” obama said. “we will not give in to fear or turn against each other. instead, we will stand united as americans to protect our people and defend our nation, and to take action against those who threaten us.” he ordered the flag at the white house to be flown at half staff to honor the victims.  the shooter, who was identified as florida resident omar s. mateen was killed by police at the nightclub. a top u.s. congressman said mateen may have pledged allegiance to the islamic state militant group, but u.s. officials cautioned they had no direct evidence of a connection.   fifty three people were wounded in the rampage, which surpassed the 32 people killed in the 2007 massacre at virginia tech university. obama said it was appropriate for the fbi to investigate the massacre as an act of terrorism and said he would “spare no effort” to determine whether the assailant had been inspired or associated with an extremist group. the president also termed the shooting a new reminder of “how easy it is for someone to get their hands on a weapon that lets them shoot people in a school or in a house of worship or a movie theater or in a nightclub,” a reference to other mass killings that have punctuated recent u.s. history.  “we have to decide if that’s the kind of country we want to be,” he said.

" president donald trump is ordering federal agencies to undermine obamacare through regulatory action, a move that could weaken  enforcement of the requirement for americans to buy health coverage and give insurers leeway to drop some benefits.  trump’s first executive order, signed hours after taking office on friday, directs the federal government to scale back regulations, taxes and penalties under president barack obama’s healthcare law, the affordable care act (aca).  republican lawmakers, who are working on new legislation to repeal and replace obamacare, praised the order as showing trump’s commitment to gutting the program and lowering steep healthcare costs they blame on the law. trump did not specify which parts of the program would be affected by his order, and any changes are unlikely to affect  the government funded or subsidized insurance plans covering more than 20 million people in 2017.  trump’s nominee to head the u.s. department of health and human services, georgia representative tom price, has said there was no plan for “pulling the rug out” on millions of americans’ healthcare as a replacement is designed. but the scope of trump’s order drives home the uncertainties of that process, healthcare experts said. “the order could affect virtually anything in the law, provided it is couched as a delay in implementing the law,” said stuart butler, a senior fellow at the brookings institution. trump’s administration could decide to delay or not enforce the individual mandate, a requirement that americans buy health coverage if they do not already have benefits from their employer or the government, as well as a similar requirement for employers of a certain size to insure their workers, experts said. others say those changes, if not handled carefully, could force insurance premiums higher and make healthcare less affordable for americans   outcomes that trump and republicans say they are trying to avoid. “the administration has to run a really fine line here,” said dan mendelson, chief executive of the washington based consulting firm avalere health. “they’re not going on record as saying what they’re going to do at this point.” the administration could also alter, or fail to enforce, requirements that insurers cover a basic set of health benefits in all of their plans, from maternity and newborn care to mental health services. “this could be a signal to the insurance industry that they could offer new products that, for example, didn’t include maternity benefits, in order to attract more sales from people who would prefer a slimmer package,” said joe antos of the american enterprise institute think tank. republican lamar alexander, chairman of the senate health committee, said last week that price, once confirmed, could relax requirements for u.s. states to get exemptions from the law, as well as make it easier for states to get waivers on the medicaid health plan for low income households. “allow states more flexibility to determine the essential health benefits ... that’s probably the single most important step that could be taken to create a market where more insurers are likely to sell policies,” alexander said.  his committee is one of several in the house and senate working on repealing and replacing obamacare.  three of the largest health insurers – aetna inc, unitedhealth group incand humana inc – have essentially pulled out of the market offering health insurance to individuals under obamacare, citing financial losses for covering a population that was sicker than they had expected. the remaining players include anthem inc, as well as insurers that specialize in administering lower cost medicaid plans, such as molina healthcare inc. ana gupte, a senior healthcare analyst at the investment bank leerink partners, said trump’s executive order could reassure people in the market that obamacare will be dismantled one way or another.  that could be positive for insurers who would no longer face the law’s health insurance tax, she said. but it could negatively impact acute care hospitals that have seen more customers and insurers that sell policies to state medicaid programs, which could shrink in size. “it’s clear that congress is looking to repeal the law and that it’s poised to happen with a replacement. this is one more avenue to make sure their agenda is executed,” gupte said.

" any move by the european union to impose new sanctions on iran over its ballistic missile program and alleged involvement in middle east conflicts would be  interesting and helpful , a u.s. administration official said on tuesday. u.s. president donald trump, who has taken a more hawkish line on iran than predecessor barack obama, has said tehran s missile program should be curbed and wants to punish tehran over its role in yemen and syria. trump has also dealt a blow to an international 2015 deal on iran s nuclear program by disavowing iran s compliance with its terms. the u.s. congress now has until mid december to decide whether to reimpose economic sanctions on iran that had been lifted in exchange for it limiting its nuclear activity. but the eu, which normally coordinates closely with washington on international sanctions, has been lobbying hard to preserve the nuclear accord, saying it should be kept separate from missile and regional security matters.  last week, french president emmanuel macron mooted the possibility of fresh sanctions, saying he was  very concerned  about iran s missile program following the firing of a missile from yemen into saudi arabia.   it would certainly be a very interesting and probably helpful move on the part of the eu,  the u.s. administration official told reporters in brussels when asked if washington wanted the eu to pursue fresh restrictions on iran. the missile fired into saudi arabia from yemen on nov. 4 was intercepted near riyadh airport and there were no casualties. saudi arabia, which intervened against iran backed houthi rebels in yemen s war in 2015, accuses the islamic republic of supplying missiles and other weaponry to the houthis.  tehran denies this and it also rejected macron s remarks, saying its missile program was solely defensive and not linked to the nuclear pact, which european powers, russia and china   the other parties to the 2015 deal   say is vital to containing middle east tensions. and there is no consensus in the eu, where imposing any sanctions requires the unanimity of all 28 member states, on any new punitive measures, a fact made clear by the bloc s top diplomat after chairing foreign minister talks on monday.  we didn t discuss, not today, not last week (and) i don t foresee any discussion also in the future, further sanctions from the eu side on iran,  eu foreign policy chief federica mogherini told reporters when asked about macron s comments.   ballistic missiles are not in the scope of the (nuclear deal),  she said.  this is a discussion and a proposal that was never raised at our table in these recent months and i don t foresee this happening in the near future.  iran and saudi arabia are locked in a struggle for middle east predominance. their rivalry flared again earlier this month with the resignation of saudi backed lebanese prime minister saad al hariri, who blamed an alleged assassination plot against him and accused tehran and its heavily armed lebanese ally hezbollah of sowing conflict in the arab world. the u.s. administration official declined to say what the congress might do in the wake of trump s action but said any new u.s. sanctions would be targeted narrowly at people and entities involved directly in the areas of concern.  we should expect to see a continued use of the u.s. sanctions tool in the areas such as proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, support for terrorist organizations and the deterioration of human rights inside iran.  the u.s. official also said the west should keep up pressure on russia as long as it does not reverse its 2015 annexation of crimea from ukraine or implement its side of a peace deal for  ukraine s east, gripped by a moscow backed insurgency.  the eu s own economic sanctions on moscow, which restrict  business with the russian energy, defense and financial sectors, are currently in place until the end of january 2018.

" u.s. house of representatives speaker paul ryan is running again for the job in the next congress, a spokeswoman said on thursday after a media report quoted several unidentified house republicans as saying they expected him to step down next week. “he is running,” ryan spokeswoman ashlee strong said. the hill cited four house republicans as saying that they expected ryan to step aside as speaker after next tuesday’s general election. “speculation is growing that paul will not return,” the hill quoted a “senior gop lawmaker close to leadership” as saying. it quoted a member of the freedom caucus, a group of conservative republicans, as saying that if democratic presidential candidate hillary clinton wins, ryan will get “a good share of the blame” among house members who support republican candidate donald trump. ryan last month told fellow republicans that he would not defend or campaign for trump and would instead focus on re electing republicans to keep the majority in the house. this angered some trump supporters in the house, who felt the wisconsin congressman should stand by trump. one of them, representative jim bridenstine of oklahoma, tweeted: “if paul ryan isn’t for trump, then i’m not for paul ryan.” but ryan, who as speaker is the country’s highest ranking republican, has a great deal of support in the republican caucus, and it is far from clear that his critics would be able to oust him if they tried. house republicans, who currently number 246, plan to have closed door leadership elections in mid november. ryan is expected to win their nomination for speaker at that gathering, but the actual election to the speaker’s post would not be held until the new congress convenes in january. all members of the house, both republican and democrat, will vote in the speaker election and ryan will need 218 votes   a majority of the house’s 435 members   to win. this could be a challenge if republicans lose a substantial number of seats in next week’s elections, and if some of those who remain decide to oppose ryan.

" a u.s. judge on tuesday directed federal prosecutors to show him the search warrant application used to enable the fbi to access emails related to hillary clinton’s private server that were discovered shortly before the nov. 8 presidential election. u.s. district judge kevin castel in manhattan ordered prosecutors by thursday to turn over the application, which investigators obtained shortly after fbi director james comey informed congress of newly discovered emails on oct. 28, 11 days before the election won by her republican opponent donald trump. castel made the order as he considered whether any portion of the search warrant materials could be made public in response to a lawsuit filed by randol schoenberg, a los angeles based lawyer who specializes in cases to recover artwork stolen by the nazis, seeking to force the release of the documents. in court papers, schoenberg said the public had a “strong interest” in the disclosure of the search warrant materials, saying transparency was “crucial” given the potential influence the probe had on the election’s outcome. the search warrant was obtained after comey issued a letter to top u.s. lawmakers disclosing that emails potentially related to the clinton server probe had been discovered in an “unrelated case.” comey’s oct. 28 announcement roiled the campaign and drew new attention to a damaging issue for clinton. clinton, the democratic presidential nominee, used the server while she was secretary of state from 2009 to 2013. comey in july had recommended to the justice department that no criminal charges be brought against clinton over her handing of classified information in the emails. only two days before the election, comey disclosed that the newly reviewed emails did nothing to change his earlier recommendation after all. clinton days after her loss blamed comey’s letter, so close to the election, as a reason she lost to trump. sources close to the investigation have said the emails were discovered during an unrelated probe into former democratic u.s. congressman anthony weiner, the estranged husband of top clinton aide huma abedin. in court, castel said he would not be surprised if prosecutors, in submitting the materials to him, cited the presence of an ongoing probe in a case unrelated to clinton as a reason to keep the search warrant application confidential. “it could be potentially terribly unfair to a person who ultimately winds up not being charged,” castel said, apparently referring to weiner. castel said it was possible information unrelated to the clinton email probe could be redacted, and noted that in clinton’s case, comey later indicated in a subsequent letter that the server probe was closed. castel invited prosecutors to propose redactions in case he decides to release the search warrant application.

" u.s. president donald trump’s suggestion that seoul pay for the thaad advanced u.s. missile defense system would be an “impossible option,” a top foreign policy adviser to south korean presidential frontrunner moon jae in said on friday. trump told reuters in an interview on thursday he wants south korea to pay for the $1 billion terminal high altitude area defense (thaad) system.  “even if we purchase thaad, its main operation would be in the hands of the united states,” said kim ki jung, a foreign policy adviser to moon and professor at seoul’s yonsei university. “so purchasing it would be an impossible option. that was our topic when we were considering the options,” kim said. moon is leading polls by a wide margin ahead of a may 9 election to replace impeached former president park geun hye, whose government agreed last year to deploy thaad. lee ji soo, a spokesman for moon, said campaign officials were aware of the reported comments by trump and deliberating his demand that south korea pay for thaad but added that there was no official comment from moon’s camp yet. trump, in the interview as he prepared to mark 100 days in office on saturday, also accused another ally, saudi arabia, of not paying enough for the u.s. defense umbrella. trump’s comments harked back to his populist campaign rhetoric and bonnie glaser, an asia expert at washington’s center for strategic and international studies, said they betrayed a lack of strategic thinking. “trump’s remarks reflect his persistent desire for allies to pay more for their defense,” she said. “as far as their impact on south korea’s election, they will likely boost support for moon, and if he wins, it will make it harder for the u.s. to sustain a hardline policy against north korea. so trump’s remarks don’t seem very strategic to me.” trump’s comments provoked some consternation among democrats and republicans in the u.s. congress. congressional aides noted the thaad deployment came after years of discussions, in which south korea took a great deal of convincing and then suffered economic retaliation from china. “it just seems completely tone deaf ... that system isn’t just good for south korea, it’s also good for us,” one aide said, adding that it would also defend u.s. troops in south korea and deter north korea from targeting u.s. territory. the u.s. military started thaad deployment in early march, despite strong opposition from china, which says the system’s radar can be used to spy into its territory. the deployment has also prompted a north korean warning of retaliation.  south korea said on wednesday major elements of the system were moved into the planned site in seonjgu in the south of the country and would be fully operational by the end of this year. that system will have initial operational capability “very soon,” a pentagon spokesman told reporters on friday. the pentagon has called thaad a “critical measure” to defend south koreans and u.s. forces and the top u.s. commander in the pacific, admiral harry harris, said the system would be operational “in coming days.” seonjgu residents have protested, citing safety fears and its potential to be a wartime target. the united states currently has six thaad batteries worldwide and a former u.s. state department official, who estimated the cost of each at about $1.2 billion, said washington would not want to sell thaad to seoul.  “we want to retain thaad in our arsenal, consistent with all other u.s. weapons systems deployed on the korean peninsula. we own them. we retain them. we have the right to redeploy them,” the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.

" rohingya refugees in bangladesh could die due to a lack of  food, shelter and water, given the huge numbers fleeing violence in myanmar, an aid agency warned on sunday, as authorities began moving people to camps to streamline the distribution of help. nearly 410,000 members of the rohingya muslim minority fled from myanmar s western rakhine state to bangladesh to escape a military offensive that the united nations has branded a  textbook example of ethnic cleansing .  many people are arriving hungry, exhausted and with no food or water,  mark pierce, bangladesh country director for the save the children aid agency said in a statement.  i m particularly worried that the demand for food, shelter, water and basic hygiene support is not being met due to the sheer number of people in need. if families can t meet their basic needs, the suffering will get even worse and lives could be lost.  bangladesh has for decades faced influxes of rohingya fleeing persecution in buddhist majority myanmar, where the rohingya are regarded as illegal migrants. bangladesh was already home to 400,000 rohingya before the latest crisis erupted on aug. 25, when rohingya insurgents attacked police posts and an army camp in the western state of rakhine, killing a dozen people. pierce said the humanitarian response needed to be rapidly scaled up.  that can only be done if the international community steps up funding,  he said. rights monitors and fleeing rohingya say myanmar security forces and rakhine buddhist vigilantes responded to the aug. 25 insurgent attacks with what they say is a campaign of violence and arson aimed at driving out the muslim population. myanmar rejects that, saying its security forces are carrying out clearance operations against the insurgents of the arakan rohingya salvation army, which claimed responsibility for the august attacks and similar, smaller, raids in october. the myanmar government has declared the group a terrorist organization and accused it of setting the fires and attacking civilians. bangladesh border guards said the flow of refugees leaving myanmar had eased off over the past day, apparently because bad weather had discouraged people from taking to boats to reach bangladesh.  heavy rain has turned roads into mud, with refugees huddling under shelters of bamboo and plastic sheets beside them. bangladeshi authorities said they had started moving an estimated 100,000 rohingya living by the roads to camps designated as aid points.  we re not allowing any distribution to anyone from the side of the road,  said district government official kazi abdur rahman.  we want to convince them there s everything in the camp and nothing here.  a big new camp is planned but it is unclear how long it would take to build.  people are living in these muddy, awful conditions. you have to get them to some sort of space where aid can be delivered,  said chris lom of the international organization for migration.   clean water and sanitation can only be delivered in a structured environment.  there is no sign that violence has stopped in myanmar, with smoke, apparently from burning villages, seen as recently as friday, meaning more refugees are likely to cross. human rights watch said satellite imagery showed 62 rohingya villages had been torched since the violence erupted. myanmar says more than 430 people have been killed, most of them insurgents, and about 30,000 non muslim villagers have been displaced.  myanmar government leader and nobel laureate aung san suu kyi has faced a barrage of criticism from abroad for not stopping the violence. the military remains in full control of security policy and there is little sympathy for the rohingya in a country where the end of army rule has unleashed old animosities, and the military campaign in rakhine state is widely supported. suu kyi is due to make her first address to the nation on the crisis on tuesday. her foreign supporters and western governments that backed her campaign against military rule, and see her as the best hope for myanmar s future, will be hoping to see her make a commitment to protect the rights of the muslim minority. suu kyi s supporters at home could be disappointed if she is perceived to be caving in to foreign pressure and taking the side of a muslim minority blamed for initiating the violence. the united states has called for the protection of civilians and a deputy assistant secretary of state, patrick murphy, is due in myanmar this week. he will travel to sittwe, the capital of rakhine state, to meet government officials and representatives of different communities, including rohingya, but he is not seeking to travel to the conflict zone in northern rakhine state. the military has called for unity on the issue. the political party founded by retired officers and trounced by suu kyi s party in the 2015 election, could be expected to take heart to see her support eroded by the crisis.

" fed up with washington and feeling left behind, supporters of republican donald trump upended the u.s. presidential race, electing a political newcomer they say offers the country a shot at dramatic change. once dismissed by trump’s democratic rival hillary clinton as “deplorables,” supporters interviewed on tuesday shrugged off his late night tweeted insults, allegations against him of sexual misconduct and dire warnings from many in the republican establishment that the businessman turned reality television star would throw u.s. economic and foreign policy into disarray. the economy, terrorism and healthcare ranked as the top three concerns facing americans casting ballots in tuesday’s election, according to an early reading from the reuters/ipsos election day poll of about 35,000 people. “the freedom loving americans pushed back against the elites and the globalists. they might win in the long run, but we’re not dead yet,” said andrew dye, 48, of dexter, michigan. “i think this big country is getting a little too far left a little too quickly and some people finally woke up and said enough,” said dye, a partner in a small management consulting firm. cuban american sarah gird, 67, described herself as an independent who had felt let down after twice voting for democratic president barack obama. “i’m not conservative at all,” she said. but obama “didn’t produce anything.” in contrast, she said she trusted trump would fix the economy. “i think he’s sincere, he’s truthful, he means what he says,” said gird, adding she thought trump would address poverty and jobs in african american neighborhoods. for many, the vote was a rejection of clinton, whose use of a private email server during her time in government came to symbolize what is wrong with washington. “all the corruption. i’m tired of business as usual, being sold out all these years,” said kevin barrett, 57, in nashville. tom kipp, 53, an architect also of nashville, said he voted for trump because “we need somebody in there not beholden to anyone.” “our checks and balances system is beyond being compromised. i don’t say he’s my prime candidate, but he’s my best option,” kipp said. others found trump’s promise to build a wall on the southern border with mexico appealing. “last minute decision: i changed my mind to trump,” said lisa ciafone, 48, of madeira beach, florida, citing her concerns about illegal immigration and the rising costs of health insurance. “it made me lean towards trump.” vicki delira, 54, a dental hygienist from schererville, indiana, grew up a democrat but voted for trump because it was time for change even if it means “a little bit of chaos.” “it will be a little different atmosphere for a non politician to be in the white house,” delira said. “but i think there’s enough politicians around him to help round them out.” todd recknagel, managing partner of private equity firm three20 capital group, said the caricature of trump as a “monster” was overdone. “he is an effective business man at the end of the day. so things are never quite as good as they appear and things are never quite as bad as they appear in life and i think he can make a decent president,” said recknagel, 52, from panama city beach, florida. as trump became the projected winner in state after state, fans from arkansas, texas and virginia sitting on velvet sofas in the lobby of his new washington luxury hotel just down the street from the white house celebrated as waiters popped champagne. preston parry, 20, had bet all along that trump would defy the pollsters who predicted a clinton victory. “these were shadow voters, people who had never, ever voted before that the polls didn’t pick up. unlikely voters. like him or hate him   look, he did something right.” ",0

" brazilian police raided the home of agriculture minister blairo maggi on thursday in a corruption investigation linked to his time as a state governor, adding to the graft scandals rocking president michel temer s government.  last month the supreme court opened a bribery probe into maggi s role in a scheme known as  mensalinho,  a payment of a monthly stipend to lawmakers in exchange for political support in his home state of mato grosso. he served two terms as governor there between 2003 and 2010. according to a person with direct knowledge of the matter, the raid was linked to a plea deal by former mato grosso state governor silval barbosa, who accuses maggi of participating in the corruption scheme.  barbosa was maggi s vice governor, replacing him in the top job in 2010 when maggi resigned to run for a seat in brazil s senate. barbosa was subsequently elected to a four year term that ended in 2014. maggi denied any wrongdoing, claiming in a statement that barbosa  lied  in his plea bargain testimony.  i never authorized any illegal actions while in office nor have i obstructed justice,  maggi said.  maggi is a billionaire who was once brazil s largest soybean producer. his family firm amaggi sa runs large farms in mato grosso and operates a commodity trading business that competes in brazil with global firms like archer daniels midland co, cargill inc and bunge ltd. mato grosso, where federal police said they served search warrants in nine cities, is a major producer of grains and cattle. raids were also conducted in s o paulo and bras lia, the police said in a statement. the probe marks the latest blow to temer s administration, whose economic reform agenda has been repeatedly thwarted by graft investigations that have targeted top officials, including the president. temer has denied any wrongdoing.

" leaders of the congressional black caucus met with president donald trump on wednesday about infrastructure and reducing urban crime, calling the sit down a “positive” first step toward finding common ground. the lawmakers presented trump with a 130 page policy proposal titled “we have a lot to lose: solutions to advance black families in the 21st century,” a reference to trump’s repeated query on the campaign trail asking what did blacks have to lose by supporting him. “we think it’s a positive first start and we’re going to continue the dialogue,” representative karen bass, a democrat from california, told reporters after the meeting.     trump has pledged to improve the lives of african americans, who largely voted in favor of his democratic opponent, hillary clinton, in the 2016 presidential election. many black leaders have criticized his depiction of urban areas as crime ridden war zones and his false claims that the first black u.s. president, barack obama, may not have been born in the united states. trump later admitted he believes obama was u.s. born.    at the start of the meeting, trump said he was serious about his promise to help african americans. “every american child has a right to grow up in a safe community, to attend great schools, to graduate with access to high paying jobs,” trump said during the portion of the meeting open to reporters.  since coming to office trump has held a listening session with some of his black supporters and signed an executive order seeking to boost government support for historically black colleges.   caucus chairman cedric richmond, a democrat from louisiana, said that while the lawmakers share many of the same goals as trump, they often disagree with him on how to actually reach those goals. the lawmakers said the meeting was not “terse,” but they did not shy away from addressing contentious issues.   “there were many people in my family, many people in the caucus, and many people in churches that suggested we not take the meeting with president trump because of the rhetoric,” richmond said. “we expressed that to him, because we’re certainly very clear of the emotions of african americans around the country.”   ",0

" cuban president raul castro made it clear to a visiting u.s. congressional delegation that his country was intent on pursuing market reform and detente with the united states, u.s. senator patrick leahy told a news conference on wednesday. leahy, a democrat who has been key in efforts to normalize relations, was leading a bipartisan group of five u.s. senators and a representative on a three day visit to the communist run island to discuss ties and explore business opportunities. cuba watchers are looking closely for signs of how the fragile u.s. detente with cuba will fare under republican president donald trump, who has threatened to backtrack on it if he does not get “a better deal.” analysts say cuba has played its cards well so far by not responding shrilly to such provocation and demonstrating its continued willingness to engage under the new president. castro “wants reform to continue, he wants the movement forwards to continue,” said leahy at the news conference in the u.s. embassy, after meeting with the cuban president on tuesday. “the number of people he had from his administration talk to us made it very clear they want us to continue.” the delegation met with cuba’s foreign, trade and agriculture ministers as well as with castro. the group included republican senator thad cochran of mississippi who on monday oversaw the signing of agreements between cuba and two mississippi ports. “increasingly this issue of normalizing relations with cuba is bipartisan, this isn’t just democrats, there are a lot of republicans that believe we ought to do this as well,” said representative james mcgovern, a democrat. support for the detente was also growing among the business and academic communities, said mcgovern, who was traveling with a group of u.s. biotech experts keen to explore the sector in cuba. “the movement is more significant in the u.s.a. today than at any time in my career in the senate,” said leahy. “and i am the dean of the senate, i have been there the longest,” added leahy, who was first elected to the senate in 1974.  the white house said earlier this month that the trump administration was in the midst of “a full review of all u.s. policies towards cuba.” the visit came as a diplomatic incident highlighted continuing concerns about restrictions on human rights on the island. cuban authorities prevented the head of the organization of american states (oas), a former chilean minister and an ex president of mexico from traveling to cuba to attend an award ceremony on wednesday hosted by dissidents. cuba opposes anything that legitimizes dissidents, who it claims are mercenaries funded by foreign interests. it also views the oas as an imperialist instrument of the united states. oas chief luis almagro reported that cuban authorities said they were “astonished” at his involvement in “anti cuban activities” which were “an unacceptable provocation.” a u.s. embassy official attended the ceremony, organized by the latin american network of youth for democracy, a group opposed to the communist government. almagro’s seat was left empty in symbolic protest. “it may not be the smoothest of paths but it will continue,” leahy said of the u.s. cuban detente. “i would not be here today on one more trip if i didn’t think that continuation of that progress is inevitable.” ",0
" mexico and central american countries they will lobby u.s. lawmakers to protect young illegal immigrants who saw their lives thrown into limbo on tuesday after u.s. president donald trump said he would end a program that shields them from deportation.  trump announced plans to halt the deferred action for childhood arrivals (daca) program that has protected from deportation nearly 800,000 young men and women who entered the united states illegally as children. mexico’s deputy foreign minister, carlos sada, said trump’s decision created “anxiety, anguish and fear” for the roughly 625,000 mexican nationals protected under the program. “they are exceptional. ... this is as emotional for the united states as for mexico,” sada said at a news conference immediately following the announcement to end the program.  he said his government would press u.s. lawmakers for a quick solution to the uncertainty that “dreamers,” as they are commonly called, now face in their adopted home. immigrants who opt to return to mexico will be welcomed with “open arms,” sada said, offering them assistance with work, finances and education. the announcement to end daca, created by former president barack obama in a 2012 executive order, came during the final day of talks in the mexican capital to modernize the north american free trade agreement, adding pressure to already tense conversations between mexico and the united states. el salvador’s foreign relations minister, hugo martinez, said he would meet with u.s. congress members to find a solution within the next six months, before daca’s provisions are set to end, aiming to protect the 30,000 to 60,000 salvadorans who could be affected. “it’s a worrisome situation. ... we will be lobbying to have legislation as soon as possible that opens a way out,” martinez said. guatemala’s foreign relations ministry said in a statement that it is counting on the “humanitarian sensibilities” of u.s. lawmakers to ensure thousands of guatemalans are not forced to leave the country where many grew up. honduras said in a statement that it would push u.s. congress to reconsider trump’s move, and offer consular support for more than 18,500 hondurans protected by daca. the director of a honduras migrant aid center, the center for attention for honduran migrants, called the u.s. decision “very sad,” and said young hondurans forced to return home could face violence from gangs and drug traffickers. “their lives will be much more difficult and put at enormous risk,” said valdette willeman, the center’s director.

" former white house chief strategist steve bannon’s firing has been met with a collective shrug by some of president donald trump’s most committed supporters who argue the controversial nationalist became an obstacle to the administration’s agenda.    in interviews in multiple cities this weekend, americans who voted for trump said bannon’s departure on friday was the removal of an unnecessary distraction for the trump presidency, while others saw his role as largely inconsequential and possibly overblown. many expected trump to stay the course without him. “bannon was becoming too big of a story and taking the spotlight from president trump,” bob janda, a 67 year old small business owner, said in a bar in chicago. “when that happens, your days are numbered. i think trump will be fine.” at the same bar, frank cardone, 67, pointed out that bannon had a brief tenure in trump’s inner circle, having joined the republican businessman’s presidential campaign as its chief executive less than three months before the nov. 8 election. “bannon wasn’t with trump for too long so it’s no big loss,” said cardone, a retired electrician.  before hitching himself to trump, bannon was the executive chairman of breitbart news, a hard right site. he immediately returned to that role after his exit from the white house, vowing to use it as a platform to defend trump.   bannon, 63, has touted breitbart as a conservative counterpoint to what he views as the liberal bias of u.s. news outlets and a platform for the so called alt right, a loose confederation of neo nazis, white supremacists and anti semites. he played a key role in some of trump’s most contentious policy moves including the travel ban on people from several muslim majority nations, departure from the paris climate accord and rejection of the trans pacific partnership trade deal. bannon’s exit gives trump a chance to distance himself from “fringe” politics, said mike corbitt, a machinist from florida’s west palm beach. “he (trump) needs to be more center right because the far right and the far left is not where america is,” corbitt, 48, said at a fort lauderdale bar. “steve bannon was great for getting trump elected, but now the president needs someone who can get his policies enacted.” bannon joined a string of senior officials who have left the trump administration in the past five weeks, leading to the appointment of retired marine general john kelly as the new white house chief of staff. while some observers have characterized the moves as a sign of chaos in the white house, others see it as a sign that trump is running his administration like a well oiled corporation. “all these shakeups mean is that trump is doing his job,” liz lingafelter, a 60 year old nurse, said in fort lauderdale. “he’s a businessman and is doing what’s best for the organization.” that view was echoed by rick weatherly, a 61 year old denver maintenance technician. “i voted for trump, not bannon,” he said.

" new u.s. sanctions imposed on russia are inevitably harming bilateral relations but will not change russian policy, russia’s united nations ambassador vassily nebenzia said on wednesday.  “some u.s. officials were saying that this is a bill that might encourage russia to cooperate with the united states; to me that’s a strange sort of encouragement,” he told reporters. “those who invented this bill, if they were thinking they might change our policy, they were wrong.” “they should have known better, that we do not bend, we do not break,” he said. “it is harming our relations inevitably but we will be working in the conditions that exist in the hope it will turn one day.” ",0
" prominent venezuelan lawmaker freddy guevara has sought refuge in the chilean ambassador s residence in caracas amid fears he could be jailed, a development that leaves the ailing opposition with even fewer leaders to take on leftist president nicolas maduro.  authorities had sought to remove guevara s congressional immunity so that he could be tried for instigating violence. the opposition and local media said that sebin intelligence agents had surrounded guevara s house over the weekend.  guevara, a 31 year old who runs the hardline popular will party and is also the deputy leader of congress, entered the residence on saturday and requested protection, the chilean government said in a statement.  guevara could become the highest profile venezuelan politician to seek exile in recent years.  a majority of opposition leaders are now unable to challenge unpopular maduro, a 54 year old former bus driver and foreign minister whom they blame for the oil rich nation s economic downfall.  anti maduro politicians have been barred from holding office, like two time presidential candidate henrique capriles; arrested or placed under house arrest, like opposition leader leopoldo lopez; or threatened with trial, like congress leader julio borges who could face treason charges for lobbying against venezuela s government in global financial circles.  the opposition coalition condemned the threats against guevara as another sign that maduro has turned the opec member into a dictatorship.       this is an arbitrary and political decision that seeks to weaken a congress that has the full support of the people. venezuela is hungry for food, but also freedom, justice and dignity,  said borges at a news conference on sunday.   freddy guevara has taken a personal decision. in my case i have to keep doing what i have to do,  added borges, who did not offer details on guevara s arrival at the residence.  authorities on sunday mocked guevara, a fiery former student leader, for taking refuge at the embassy.   some people are very brave when it comes to calling for and provoking violence, destruction, and death. but when justice is done, they flee with embarrassing cowardice,  tweeted foreign minister jorge arreaza.   guevara was often on the front lines of sometimes violent protests earlier this year to demand early elections, humanitarian aid to alleviate hunger, freedom for jailed dissidents, and respect for the opposition led congress.  the government says counters demonstrations were in fact a u.s. backed  armed insurrection  designed to oust maduro. authorities say opposition politicians are responsible for the around 125 deaths during four months of unrest, and as such should face trial.  amid the political crackdown, the chilean residence in caracas has played a significant role, taking in five magistrates named by the opposition run congress after they were threatened with jail time, as well as another opposition politician from party copei.  the magistrates fled over the border to colombia last month before flying to santiago to be received by leftist michelle bachelet s government, which has joined a chorus of major latin american nations in denouncing maduro.  in the 1970s, several thousand chileans, including novelist isabel allende, who fled augusto pinochet s dictatorship found exile in then booming venezuela.

" the u.s. environmental protection agency said that a freeze  handed down by president donald trump’s white house on new contracts and grants that has led to fears of delays in toxic pollution cleanups would be completely reversed on friday or at latest on monday.  the freeze has led to widespread concerns in states and cities about potential delays in efforts to monitor and clean up toxic pollution, particularly lead pollution in drinking water, that would put the health of americans at risk. the agency allocates nearly $4 billion annually on projects ranging from cleaning up polluted industrial sites to testing air and water for toxins. doug ericksen, a former washington state senator who is the epa’s new communications director, said in an email that $3.8 billion of the $3.9 billion in contracts and grants was cleared on wednesday night. “the remainder should be cleared today. there might be a very small number left for monday, but not likely.”  the epa has not issued any news releases about ending the freeze, which has led to uncertainty.  on thursday, a day after ericksen said the vast majority of the contracts and grants were cleared, five democratic senators, including edward markey and tom carper, wrote a letter to trump “with alarm” urging him to “immediately reverse this troubling action.”     ericksen said they should rest assured. “no projects are delayed or cut. none. not sure how much more clear i can be,” he said in the email.  u.s. representative dan kildee from flint, michigan, home to the lead poisoning crisis in drinking water, also wrote to trump this week asking when the freeze would be lifted. an epa spokeswoman told kildee’s office that $100 million in congressional aid would not be affected by the freeze. but kildee was uncertain whether contracts and grants centering on testing and expertise about the lead crisis would be delayed. a kildee spokesman said on friday that the congressman had still not gotten a written response to his letter from trump or the epa.  the epa sent employees an internal memo late on friday, seen by reuters that said it was making progress in lifting the freeze, which it called standard practice during a transition. “as of today, we have completed review of our grant programs,” the memo said. “the review of contracts is nearly complete, with very few contracts still under review,” the memo said, without elaborating.

" japanese prime minister shinzo abe said on monday he believed  u.s. president donald trump understood the value of free trade and that he would keep pitching a multinational trade pact that trump’s administration has vowed to exit. “i believe president trump understands the importance of free and fair trade, so i’d like to pursue his understanding on the strategic and economic importance of the tpp (trans pacific partnership) trade pact,” abe told a session of parliament’s lower house. abe also said he wanted to strengthen the u.s. japan security alliance, based on mutual trust with trump. “when we met last time, i believed him to be trustworthy, this belief has not changed today,” abe added, referring to his november meeting with then president elect trump. abe also said tokyo wanted to explain how its companies have contributed to the u.s. economy, a stance the japanese government has adopted to try to fend off threats of a “border tax” on imports into the united states. japanese chief cabinet secretary yoshihide suga said separately that tokyo would closely monitor any impact of the new u.s. administration’s policies on its companies and that he wanted to deepen economic ties between the two countries. trump took office as the 45th president of the u.s. on friday and pledged to end what he called an “american carnage” of rusted factories and crime in an inaugural address that was a populist and nationalist rallying cry. the new trump administration said on friday its trade strategy to protect american jobs would start with withdrawal from the 12 nation trans pacific partnership (tpp) trade pact. the trade deal, which the united states signed but has not ratified, was a pillar of former president barack obama’s pivot to asia, and abe has touted it as an engine of economic reform, as well as a counter weight to a rising china.

" u.s. republicans on tuesday fell short yet again in their seven year drive to repeal obamacare, in a bitter defeat that raises more questions about their ability to enact president donald trump’s agenda. the party was unable to win enough support from its own senators for a bill to repeal the 2010 affordable care act and decided not to put it to a vote, several republicans said. the bill’s sponsors vowed to try again, but face steeper odds after sunday, when special rules expire that allow them to pass healthcare legislation without democratic support. “we basically ran out of time,” said senator ron johnson, a co sponsor of the measure with senators bill cassidy, lindsey graham and dean heller. republicans have now repeatedly failed to deliver on their longtime promise to roll back former democratic president barack obama’s signature domestic accomplishment.     they have yet to achieve any major domestic policy successes in congress this year, which could hurt their efforts to retain control of the senate and house of representatives in the november 2018 congressional elections. republicans widely view obamacare, which provides coverage to 20 million americans, as a costly government overreach. trump vowed frequently during the 2016 election campaign to scrap it. democrats have fiercely defended it, saying it has extended health insurance to millions.  after falling short in july, senate republicans tried again this month with a bill that would have given states greater control over the hundreds of billions of dollars that the federal government spends annually on health care. as before, they ran into objections from members on the right and the center who opposed repeal for essentially opposite reasons. senator susan collins, a moderate, complained it undermined the medicaid program for the poor and weakened consumer protections. senator rand paul, a conservative, said it left too many of obamacare’s regulations and spending programs in place. democrats said it was time for republicans to work with them to fix obamacare’s shortcomings, and republican senator lamar alexander said he would resume talks with democratic senator patty murray to shore up the law’s insurance subsidies. shares of healthcare providers ended broadly higher. hospital company hca healthcare inc rose 1.8 percent, while insurer centene corp, which focuses on medicaid, rose 2.2 percent. the insurance industry, hospitals, medical advocacy groups such as the american medical association, american heart association and american cancer society, the aarp advocacy group for the elderly and consumer activists opposed the latest bill. trump said on tuesday his administration was disappointed in “certain so called republicans” who did not support the bill. the republican president said later he still had not given up hope that the law would eventually be repealed. “it’ll happen,” he told reporters while traveling to new york for a fundraiser. republicans hold a slim 52 48 majority in the senate and  at least three senators   collins, paul and john mccain of arizona   had publicly rejected the bill. republicans crafted special rules earlier this year that allowed them to pass a bill with a simple majority in the 100 seat chamber. after those rules expire at the start of the new fiscal year on sunday, they will need at least 60 votes to advance most legislation.  john thune, a member of the republican leadership in the senate, said the party would likely not try to undo obamacare again until it was clear there were enough votes for it. he said the party would now focus on overhauling the u.s. tax code   another complex undertaking that could meet with stiff resistance from a wide range of interest groups. a cbs poll on monday showed 52 percent of americans disapproved of the graham cassidy healthcare bill, while 20 percent approved.       “i will readily admit that the republican party has done a bad job of explaining what we’re for in terms of replace on obamacare,” republican senator ben sasse said on the senate floor. six protesters staged a “die in” on the floor of a senate  office building, lying on the ground and covering their heads and bodies with a white shroud to represent what they said would be lives lost if the bill passed. the non partisan congressional budget office said the number of people with health insurance covering high cost medical events would be slashed by millions if the latest republican bill had it become law.  the cbo also found that federal spending on medicaid would be cut by about $1 trillion from 2017 to 2026 and that millions of people would lose their coverage in the program, mainly from a repeal of federal funding for obamacare’s medicaid expansion.

" british prime minister theresa may will stress the value of free trade and her support for the iran nuclear deal when she meets u.s. president donald trump later this week, her spokeswoman said on monday. trump’s election has raised questions over the future of the so called special relationship that has underpinned close british american ties for decades, but the new u.s. leader has praised last year’s vote to leave the eu and says he wants to arrange a swift bilateral trade deal with britain. supporters of britain’s exit from the european union have cheered these comments, but others have questioned how this will fit with trump’s protectionist policies, including his inaugural speech promise to put “america first”.  “you can expect the prime minister to be very clear during her u.s. visit on the benefits of free trade and championing them and wanting to look at what more can be done to increase that,” may’s spokeswoman told reporters on monday. the spokeswoman said she expected the prime minister would also make clear to trump that britain is a strong supporter of the 2015 nuclear accord between iran and world powers, which the new u.s. leader has threatened to either scrap or change. at the white house, trump spokesman sean spicer said the new u.s. president will discuss the potential for greater trade with britain in his meeting with may. he said he did not believe there were plans for the two leaders to hold a news conference. spicer acknowledged the “special relationship” between the united states and the uk, adding, “but we can always be closer.” may is due to attend the annual “republican retreat” in philadelphia on thursday, becoming the first serving head of state to speak at the event, before holding bilateral talks with trump in washington on friday.    thousands of women marched in london on saturday to protest about trump’s attitude to women, joining demonstrations held in major cities across the globe. when asked during a bbc interview on sunday about controversy over trump’s comments on women, may, britain’s second female premier, said she would not be afraid to challenge any “unacceptable” talk from trump. she is also expected to discuss nato with trump, who has described the military alliance as “obsolete.” ahead of her u.s. visit, may spoke with nato secretary general jens stoltenberg on sunday. “they discussed the continued importance of the alliance as the bulwark of our defense and agreed on the need for the alliance to continue to evolve to be able to effectively counter the biggest threats of the day, in particular terrorism and cyber attacks,” a spokesman for may said after the call. “the prime minister said she would be taking these messages to washington later this week.” ",0
"rick scott has been governor of florida for just over one term but already the state is feeling the effects of his conservative fanaticism. while the rest of the country continues to combat the spread of hiv and the number of people dying from aids drops, florida is seeing the reverse.in a comprehensive review of how scott s war against government led to his deep slashes in public health funding, the miami herald discovered two disturbing facts: florida now leads the nation in hiv cases, and its biggest county, miami-dade, is ground zero.new cases last year totaled 6,240, the highest since 2002. miami-dade and broward together account for 38 percent of that total.although florida is among the nation s fastest-growing states, scott has pushed every year to trim the state work force, and nearly one quarter of those reductions have been in the department of health.the 67 county health departments, largely funded by the state health agency, have declined to 10,519 positions compared to 12,759 in the year scott took office. it s indicative of the neglect of this administration across the board in social services,  said sen. oscar braynon, d-miami gardens.  we have a rise in aids and we have a reduction in public health spending. we re now cutting just to be cutting. indeed, scott is often cited as one of the conservative movement s standard bearers. he s a tax-cutting superstar in the same vein as kansas governor sam brownback (who imploded his state s economy) and michigan governor rick snyder (whose neglect poisoned an entire city).however, he differs from his fellow conservative tax-slashers in that he doesn t even seem remorseful for the negative impact he s had. at least brownback had the decency to break down in tears after destroying his state s job growth. in a disturbing reminder of the reagan era, when conservative politicians intentionally ignored the aids epidemic contributing to the deaths of thousands by their apathy, scott appears to be unconcerned about this surge in hiv cases. or perhaps he s just grown used to it. after his first year in office, the number of hiv cases has grown hand-over-fist.making matters worse, scott has routinely fought against working with obamacare in his state. for years. all the while, hiv cases piled up as his budget cuts took hold. this spells disasters for the victims of hiv because the best and only way to prevent it from turning into the much deadlier aids illness is careful health management. you can t get that if your governor has refused to expand access to health insurance to spite the president.as we ve seen around the country, republicans who have grown used to screaming about the  tyranny  of big government are met with disaster when they attempt to get rid of it. far from the freedom of living a life of liberty and self-determination, states that try to cut government spending only cause misery for the citizens they are trying to  liberate.  it s easy to say as a concept that  government is bad,  but harder to accept that you can no longer get healthcare or build safe roads without it.florida is learning the hard way that government spending isn t always  wasteful.  oftentimes it is being used to keep the real threats like illness and poverty at bay.feature image via gage skidmore/flickr",1
" a belgian teenager who blamed the local mayor for his father s suicide after he was fired from a town hall job has confessed to slashing the politician s throat in a cemetery on monday night, public broadcaster rtbf said. the murder of alfred gadenne, 71, the mayor of mouscron and a former lawmaker in the regional parliament, has shocked the country, with the prime minister expressing his  horror . the public prosecutor told reuters that a man was under arrest after giving himself up to police at the scene after dark in mouscron, an industrial border town of 57,000 close to the french city of lille. he declined comment on media reports. rtbf, citing sources including the suspect s lawyer, said he was 18 and told police he was avenging his father, who killed himself two years ago after losing his job as a local council employee. a box cutter was found at the scene, where the young man had calmly called police to attend around 8 p.m. gadenne, a conservative whose death prompted tributes from across the national political spectrum, acted as caretaker for the cemetery next to his home and was killed after going there to lock up for the night, as he did every evening. media reporting of this spare time occupation during his decade as mayor had allowed the suspect to find gadenne alone, rtbf said. it added that the man waited until he reached the age of majority so his mother, also a municipal employee, could not be held liable for his actions under belgian law. mourners left flowers at the cemetery gates and visited the town hall to sign a book of condolence for the mayor.

" in september 2014, gilberto velasquez, a 38 year old house painter from el salvador, received life changing news: the u.s. government had decided to shelve its deportation action against him.  the move was part of a policy change initiated by then president barack obama in 2011 to pull back from deporting immigrants who had formed deep ties in the united states and whom the government considered no threat to public safety. instead, the administration would prioritize illegal immigrants who had committed serious crimes.  last month, things changed again for the painter, who has lived in the united states illegally since 2005 and has a u.s. born child. he received news that the government wanted to put his deportation case back on the court calendar, citing another shift in priorities, this time by president donald trump.  the trump administration has moved to reopen the cases of hundreds of illegal immigrants who, like velasquez, had been given a reprieve from deportation, according to government data and court documents reviewed by reuters and interviews with immigration lawyers.  trump signaled in january that he planned to dramatically widen the net of illegal immigrants targeted for deportation, but his administration has not publicized its efforts to reopen immigration cases.  it represents one of the first concrete examples of the crackdown promised by trump and is likely to stir fears among tens of thousands of illegal immigrants who thought they were safe from deportation.  while cases were reopened during the obama administration as well, it was generally only if an immigrant had committed a serious crime, immigration attorneys say. the trump administration has sharply increased the number of cases it is asking the courts to reopen, and its targets appear to include at least some people who have not committed any crimes since their cases were closed.  between march 1 and may 31, prosecutors moved to reopen 1,329 cases, according to a reuters' analysis of data from the executive office of immigration review, or eoir. the obama administration filed 430 similar motions during the same period in 2016.   jennifer elzea, a spokeswoman for u.s. immigration and customs enforcement, confirmed the agency was now filing motions with immigration courts to reopen cases where illegal immigrants had “since been arrested for or convicted of a crime.”  it is not possible to tell from the eoir data how many of the cases the trump administration is seeking to reopen involve immigrants who committed crimes after their cases were closed.  attorneys interviewed by reuters say indeed some of the cases being reopened are because immigrants were arrested for serious crimes, but they are also seeing cases involving people who haven’t committed crimes or who were cited for minor violations, like traffic tickets.  “this is a sea change, said attorney david leopold, former president of the american immigration lawyers association. “before, if someone did something after the case was closed out that showed that person was a threat, then it would be reopened. now they are opening cases just because they want to deport people.”  elzea said the agency reviews cases, “to see if the basis for prosecutorial discretion is still appropriate.”  after obama announced his shift toward targeting illegal immigrants who had committed serious crimes, prosecutors embraced their new discretion to close cases.  between january 2012 and trump’s inauguration on jan. 20, the government shelved some 81,000 cases, according to reuters’ data analysis. these so called “administrative closures” did not extend full legal status to those whose cases were closed, but they did remove the threat of imminent deportation.  trump signed an executive order overturning the obama era policy on jan. 25. under the new guidelines, while criminals remain the highest priority for deportation, anyone in the country illegally is a potential target.  in cases reviewed by reuters, the administration explicitly cited trump's executive order in 30 separate motions as a reason to put the immigrant back on the court docket. (for a link to an excerpted document: tmsnrt.rs/2si6aby)  since immigration cases aren’t generally public, reuters was able to review only cases made available by attorneys.  in the 32 reopened cases examined by reuters:  —22 involved immigrants who, according to their attorneys, had not been in trouble with the law since their cases were closed.  —two of the cases involved serious crimes committed after their cases were closed: domestic violence and driving under the influence.  —at least six of the cases involved minor infractions, including speeding after having unpaid traffic tickets, or driving without a valid license, according to the attorneys.  in velasquez’s case, for example, he was cited for driving without a license in tennessee, where illegal immigrants cannot get licenses, he said.  “i respect the law and just dedicate myself to my work,” he said. “i don’t understand why this is happening.”  motions to reopen closed cases have been filed in 32 states, with the highest numbers in california, florida and virginia, according to reuters’ review of eoir data. the bulk of the examples reviewed by reuters were two dozen motions sent over the span of a couple days by the new orleans ice office.  sally joyner, an immigration attorney in memphis, tennessee said one of her central american clients, who crossed the border with her children in 2013, was allowed to stay in the united states after the government filed a motion to close her case in december 2015.  since crossing the border, the woman has not been arrested or had trouble with law enforcement, said joyner, who asked that her client’s name not be used because of the pending legal action.  nevertheless, on march 29, ice filed a two page motion to reopen the case against the woman and her children. when joyner queried ice, an official said the agency had been notified that her client had a criminal history in el salvador, according to documents seen by reuters.  the woman had been arrested for selling pumpkin seeds as an unauthorized street vendor. government documents show u.s. authorities knew about the arrest before her case was closed.  dana marks, president of the national association of immigration judges, said that revisiting previously closed matters will add to a record backlog of 580,000 pending immigration cases.  “if we have to go back and review all of those decisions that were already made, it clearly generates more work,” she said. “it’s a judicial do over.”  ",0
"according to a new survey by mclaughlin and associates, 69 percent of americans back the president s order to end the  catch and release  policy and make stronger laws regarding the deportation of criminal illegal aliens.  this included hispanic voters, 56 percent of whom support the deportation of criminal aliens.52 percent of the democratic voters who supported hillary clinton in the last election said they supported ending the  catch and release  policy.across the board, 59 percent of those polled agreed that federal funding for  sanctuary cities  should be cut and 29 percent disagreeing.  hispanic voters were a little more divided on the issue though with 46 percent supporting the cutting of funds and 43 percent opposing it.this is an excellent example of the fact that president trump s common sense policies are being well received by americans, regardless of ethnic background.  there s nothing un-american about deporting criminals, so please don t let the media tell you otherwise.(source: mrctv)",1
"the defense department secretly set up a program ten years ago to investigate unidentified flying objects, or ufos, at the urging of then-democratic senate majority leader harry reid, according to new reports.both the new york times and the website politico published stories saturday revealing the existence of the pentagon s now-defunct advanced aerospace threat identification program.the new york times said the ufo program began in 2007, while politico reported in began in 2009.according to the reports, reid, a nevada democrat, helped steer money under the program to a donor s aerospace research company.a pentagon spokesman said the ufo program ended in 2012, though the new york times said the defense department still investigates potential episodes of unidentified flying objects. the advanced aviation threat identification program ended in the 2012 timeframe,  pentagon spokeswoman dana white told politico.  it was determined that there were other, higher-priority issues that merited funding and it was in the best interest of the dod to make a change. white added:  the dod takes seriously all threats and potential threats to our people, our assets, and our mission and takes action whenever credible information is developed. politico said the program was not classified but few officials knew about it. reid secured the funding for the program in 2009 with the help of former hawaii democratic sen. daniel inouye and former alaska sen. ted stevens, who have both since died.both outlets said reid s interest in ufos was the result of friend, and donor bob bigelow, who owns bigelow aerospace and has said before he is  absolutely convinced  aliens exist and ufos have visited earth.the new york times said the program had a $22 million annual budget and  most of the money  went to bigelow s research company, which hired subcontractors and solicited research for the program. i m not embarrassed or ashamed or sorry i got this thing going,  reid told the newspaper.  i think it s one of the good things i did in my congressional service. i ve done something that no one has done before. both outlets said the person who ran the program, luis elizondo, resigned in october and complained about a lack of interest from top officials about it.   fox news",1
" tens of thousands of palestinians including hundreds of gunmen rallied in gaza on thursday to mark the 30th anniversary of hamas s founding and its chief vowed to reverse u.s. president donald trump s recognition of jerusalem as israel s capital. earlier in the day, israel shut its border crossings with gaza in response to daily rocket fire from the hamas ruled enclave since trump s announcement on dec. 6, which stirred anger across the arab and muslim world and concern among washington s european allies as well as russia.  we will knock down trump s decision. no superpower is capable of offering jerusalem to israel, there is no israel that it should have a capital named jerusalem. our souls, our blood, our sons and our homes are a sacrifice for jerusalem,  hamas leader ismail haniyeh told the rally in gaza city.  with gunmen from other palestinian militant groups showing support for hamas, haniyeh added,  we are marching towards jerusalem, sacrificing millions of martyrs along the way,  and the crowd repeated his chants. israeli aircraft struck three hamas facilities before dawn after the latest rocket salvo, israel s military said. it said it targeted training camps and weapons storage compounds. hamas usually evacuates such facilities when border tensions rise. two of the rockets fired by militants were intercepted by israel s iron dome anti missile system and a third exploded in an open area of southern israel. there were no reports of casualties on either side of the frontier. the military said in a statement that  due to the security events and in accordance with security assessments , kerem shalom crossing   the main passage point for goods entering  gaza   and the erez pedestrian crossing would be shut as of thursday. it did not say how long the closure would last. around 15 rockets have been fired into southern israel since trump s announcement. none of the projectiles has caused serious injury or damage. the attacks have drawn israeli air strikes that have killed two hamas gunmen. two other palestinians have been killed in confrontations with israeli troops during stone throwing protests along the border. israeli cabinet minister tzachi hanegbi said on israel radio that while hamas, which last fought a war with israel in 2014, was not responsible for the rocket fire, it needed to rein in militants from  breakaway groups  or it would  find itself in a situation where it has to contend  with the israeli military. in istanbul on wednesday, a summit of more than 50 muslim countries condemned trump s move and urged the world to respond by recognizing east jerusalem, captured by israel along with the west bank in a 1967 war, as the capital of palestine. palestinians want east jerusalem for the capital of a future state they seek in israeli occupied territory. trump s declaration has been applauded by israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu as a recognition of political reality and jews  biblical links to jerusalem, a city that is also holy to muslims and christians. nazareth, the israeli arab city where jesus is thought to have been raised, has canceled some christmas celebrations in protest at trump s move, officials there said. there was no word from bethlehem, the palestinian west bank town that is jesus s traditional birthplace, whether it was also weighing a cutback on its celebrations at a crucial time of year for the its tourist trade.

" president donald trump’s call for congress to toughen the iran nuclear deal faced opposition on friday from among the ranks of his fellow republicans as well as from democrats, narrowing the chances any legislation could pass. as trump announced that he had chosen not to certify tehran is complying with the deal but would not immediately withdraw from it, republican senators bob corker and tom cotton offered an outline of legislation they said would “address flaws” in the accord. if passed, the measure would set stricter restrictions on iran and immediately revive u.s. sanctions imposed over iran’s nuclear program if tehran is deemed able to produce a nuclear weapon within a year. “we have provided a route to overcome deficiencies (in the agreement) and to keep the administration in the deal, and actually make it the kind of deal that it should have been in the first place,” corker, chairman of the senate foreign relations committee, said on a call with journalists. republicans control congress, but their four seat edge in the senate means any measure would need democratic support to pass, even if every member of trump’s party supports it. that is not a given. republican senator marco rubio said he had “serious doubts” about the corker cotton plan. he said he would reserve judgment until the final measure, but preferred that trump abandon the deal. “ultimately, leaving the nuclear deal, reimposing suspended sanctions, and having the president impose additional sanctions would serve our national interest better than a decertified deal that leaves sanctions suspended or a new law that leaves major flaws in that agreement in place,” rubio said in a statement. most democrats were strongly opposed. senator ben cardin, ranking democrat on the foreign relations panel, said he would only support a measure backed by european allies who had signed the nuclear pact, formally known as the jcpoa. “anything we do must be consistent with the jcpoa, cannot lead us on a path to violate the jcpoa and must have the support of our european allies,” he told reuters in a telephone interview. cardin said he wanted a full senate briefing on the plan from administration officials, and then committee hearings. corker acknowledged the tough fight ahead, but said he hoped to win over democrats. he pledged to seek the support of european allies britain, france and germany, who had signed the agreement and urged trump not to decertify.

" honduras  election tribunal will re count 4,753 ballot boxes that have cast a shadow on the results of the country s presidential election, the tribunal chief said on thursday, bowing to a demand by the organization of american states (oas). nearly two weeks since honduras  nov. 26 presidential election, the result remains unknown, with allegations of electoral fraud sparking protests and a chorus of international concern over events in the poor central american nation.  official results showed honduras  conservative president juan orlando hernandez with a narrow 1.6 percentage point lead over center left opposition leader salvador nasralla. however, no victor has yet been declared by the election tribunal. the tribunal declared nasralla the leader in an announcement on the morning after the vote, with just over half of the ballot boxes counted. however, it gave no further updates for about 36 hours. once results then started flowing again, nasralla s lead quickly started narrowing.  on thursday, after meeting with the united states  top diplomat in honduras and the oas country representative, tribunal chief david matamoros said there would be a re count of ballot boxes that arrived after the 36 hour pause, and which the opposition has claimed are tainted.  this is a process we want to undertake in front of the eyes of the world, and we want to invite civil society,  matamoros said at a press conference in the capital, tegucigalpa.  the oas, which on wednesday said it may call for new honduran elections if  irregularities  undermine the credibility of results, had previously called for a recount of those 4,753 ballot boxes. it remains to be seen if the opposition will accept the tribunal s offer. nasralla on wednesday evening called for an international arbiter to oversee a recount of the entire 18,000 odd ballot boxes, saying he no longer recognized the honduran tribunal because of its role in the process. separately, honduras  security ministry said on thursday it was removing the curfew from three more departments, meaning only six of the country s 18 departments are still under curfew.

" nearly half the 19 people injured when a driver with no known extremist links plowed into pedestrians in the southern city of melbourne were foreign nationals, australian prime minister malcolm turnbull said on friday. police allege that the 32 year old australian man, a refugee from afghanistan, had a history of mental illness and drove a car into christmas shoppers on one of the busiest roads in australia s second largest city on thursday. the incident was a chilling reminder of attacks using vehicles in cities around the world. four people were killed in a similar incident in melbourne in january. turnbull and police said the driver had no known ties to extremist organizations, although they also said he had spoken of the perceived mistreatment of muslims after his arrest. police have yet to interview, charge or identify the man. turnbull said nine of the victims were foreign nationals. he did not specify their nationalities but australian media reported they included people from china, india, ireland, italy, new zealand, south korea and venezuela.  this is a shocking incident to occur just on the eve of christmas but we will not be cowed by it,  turnbull told reporters in sydney. four people were killed and more than 20 injured in january when a man deliberately drove into pedestrians just a few hundred meters away from thursday s attack. that was also not designated as a terror attack. police had cordoned off the area immediately after the incident but roads in central melbourne were open and trams were operating as usual on friday morning. reuters witnesses reported a heavy police presence around exits from nearby flinders street train station, with trauma support and red cross workers in the area. department store staff said foot traffic was down from the day before.  it s definitely quieter,  said a saleswoman at a beauty counter in the david jones department store, who declined to give her name.  more people are coming in from the back entrance. i think they re trying to avoid flinders street station,  she said. workers at walker s doughnuts, which overlooks the site of the incident, said business was normal.  we thought it would be less, but we re very busy,  said store worker bindu kaki. police vehicles lined the streets and volunteers for the victorian council of churches in australia stood in high  visibility shirts with labels reading  personal support . community group the ahmadiyya muslim community of victoria issued a statement denouncing the incident and offering to donate blood to victims.  as australian muslims it is not just a moral but also a religious duty to condemn in the strongest possible terms (the) horrific and senseless act of violence,  it said. police said a second man arrested at the scene was released and was expected to be charged with possession of cannabis and a controlled weapon, although those offences were not linked to the car incident.

" a california republican state lawmaker is challenging the legality of a move by democrats in the legislature to hire former u.s. attorney general eric holder to help in any legal battles with president elect donald trump’s administration. assembly member kevin kiley has requested a formal ruling from state lawyers on whether the decision by democratic legislative leaders to hire holder and his firm, covington & burling, for $25,000 a month violated a provision in the state’s constitution that bans hiring outside counsel for work the state’s own lawyers can do. “people might have differing feelings about eric holder and about the incoming presidential administration, but all of us should be able to agree that as legislators we have a duty to abide by the law,” kiley, an attorney, said in a phone interview on monday. kiley’s request came on the eve of hearings in the democratic led legislature on the nomination of u.s. representative xavier becerra as state attorney general, another move by democrats to position california to defend its liberal policies against the republican trump. america’s most populous state voted heavily for democrat hillary clinton in the nov. 8 presidential election. under the trump administration, which takes office on jan. 20, california is expected to take a role similar to that played by texas, kansas and other conservative states during democratic president barack obama’s administration. those states mounted legal challenges to obama’s executive orders and federal policies on such issues as healthcare, immigration and the environment. california republicans have been mostly quiet on democratic governor jerry brown’s nomination of becerra. but the hiring of holder, who was obama’s attorney general from 2009 to 2015, prompted an outpouring of protest from republican lawmakers. “democrats should focus on solving these real world problems instead of wasting tax payer money to score political points before the president elect even takes office,” assembly republican leader chad mayes said in a statement.  kevin liao, a spokesman for democratic state assembly speaker anthony rendon said on monday his office had conferred with the state legislative counsel and other legal sources before hiring holder’s firm. he disagreed the hiring was prohibited, saying the constitutional ban referred to hiring by the executive branch of government and not the legislature. liao added that legislature needed legal advice from attorneys experienced in dealing with federal agencies and federal law   cases in which the state attorney general’s office does not specialize.

" u.s. chief justice john roberts on monday rejected a new mexico lawyer’s long shot bid to force a senate confirmation vote on president barack obama’s supreme court pick, merrick garland, after republican senators refused to act on his nomination. steven michel, a santa fe environmental attorney, filed suit in u.s. federal court in august, arguing that the republican led senate’s failure to act on garland’s nomination deprived michel of his rights as a voter under the u.s. constitution’s 17th amendment, which outlines how senators are elected. the u.s. constitution calls on the president to nominate supreme court justices, with confirmation of the selection in the hands of the senate. the senate, in a move with little precedent in u.s. history, simply refused to consider garland’s nomination, saying the winner of the nov. 8 presidential election between republican donald trump and democrat hillary clinton should make the pick. michel lost in lower courts before roberts denied the emergency application on monday without comment. obama nominated garland, a moderate appeals court judge, on march 16 to fill the vacant seat on the high court created by the feb. 13 death of long serving conservative antonin scalia. trump, who takes office on jan. 20, will now make the appointment. on jan. 18, garland will resume hearing cases in his current position as chief judge of the u.s. court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit, according to the court’s calendar. garland had stepped aside from hearing cases after obama nominated him to the supreme court.  the court currently has four conservative justices and four liberals. scalia’s replacement could tilt its ideological balance for years to come, restoring the long standing conservative majority just at a time when it appeared liberals would get an upper hand on the bench. this could be pivotal in a wide range of issues including abortion, the death penalty, religious rights, presidential powers, transgender rights, federal regulations and others. trump previously unveiled a list of 21 conservative jurists he would consider for the job and said this month he had whittled the list down to “probably three or four.” last week, trump’s incoming chief of staff, reince priebus, said the announcement would be made close the new president’s jan 20 inauguration.

" the head of russian state oil giant rosneft, igor sechin, will not be in moscow on wednesday where he is meant to appear in court to testify in a major corruption trial of a former minister, according to russian news agencies.  russian prosecutors accuse alexei ulyukayev of extorting a $2 million bribe from powerful political rival sechin in exchange for approving a lucrative business deal in what turned out to be a sting operation.  ulyukayev, who was fired by president vladimir putin from his post as economy minister shortly after being detained, denies the charges and says sechin framed him.   asked by reporters whether he would be in moscow on wednesday when the hearing is due, sechin replied that he would be still be on a visit to western siberia where on tuesday he attended the opening of a new rosneft oil field.  tomorrow i am meeting with the governor (of the khanty mansiiysk region), gathering the staff, will be summing up results of the prime minister s visit,  sechin was quoted as saying by interfax news agency. sechin has already missed two hearings in ulyukayev s trial. he has previously said he would attend as soon as his schedule allowed. ulyukayev s arrest a year ago came moments after sechin personally handed him the cash in a late night meeting at the rosneft headquarters in exchange for signing off on rosneft s purchase of a stake in mid sized oil producer bashneft, according to investigators. the fate of bashneft, one of the most lucrative state assets to be privatized in years, was the focus of a major turf war between rival kremlin camps, sources close to the deal and in the government have said. ulyukayev was among those who believed bashneft should go to private investors. both he and sechin are deeply embedded in the tangle of allegiances and rivalries in russian politics and business.  ulyukayev belonged to a faction of economic liberals who argued for less state control over the economy, while sechin, a close ally of president vladimir putin, represents the opposite view.   rosneft spokesman mikhail leontyev dismissed speculation over possible reasons for sechin s likely absence at wednesday s hearing, also citing the demands of his schedule.   this is a made up problem and it was made up with only one purpose   to avoid attention from the essence of the trial,   leontyev said.  this is not the first case in the human or russian history when the court wants to hear a testimony of a man with tight schedule.  ulyukayev faces up to 15 years in jail if found guilty.

" next month’s senate election in wisconsin could gain silicon valley a key ally in washington in the high tech industry’s battle against the u.s. government’s growing appetite for more access to private data.  democrat russ feingold, 63, the only lawmaker to vote against the usa patriot act in 2001, leads incumbent republican senator ron johnson in the state in opinion polls ahead of the nov. 8 election. johnson, 61, rode a wave of support from conservative tea party activists to victory six years ago, sweeping feingold out of office. but polls this year have consistently shown feingold ahead, although recent surveys show a tighter race. privacy advocates and former feingold staffers said they expected feingold, if returned to office, to be sympathetic to the privacy concerns of technology companies and civil liberties groups on issues such as encryption and domestic spying, at a time when many lawmakers are being pressured to confront security threats from islamic state and other militant groups. the feingold campaign did not respond to requests for comment. apple inc (aapl.o), microsoft corp (msft.o) and other tech giants have tussled in recent years with government agencies over how much user data the companies should be forced to retain and share with investigators hunting for criminal suspects or national security threats.  those tensions grew after former national security agency contractor edward snowden leaked secrets about u.s. surveillance practices in 2013. they reached a crescendo earlier this year when the fbi tried to force apple to unlock an iphone tied to one of the shooters in a san bernardino, california, attack that killed 14 people.   chief among the goals of many companies and privacy advocates is reforming a foreign intelligence authority used to justify once secret broad internet surveillance programs exposed by snowden that will expire in december 2017 unless congress reauthorizes them.    should feingold return to capitol hill, former staffers said he would probably seek a seat on the senate intelligence committee, where he would have privileged access to classified information about government spying. feingold’s campaign has received far more contributions than johnson’s from donors employed by tech companies including alphabet inc’s google (googl.o) and intel corp (intc.o), a review of u.s. federal election commission records showed.  digital privacy activists have long regarded feingold as an ally and aggressive overseer of the intelligence community, a reputation he burnished as the sole vote against the usa patriot act, which was passed after the sept. 11 attacks, expanding the government’s surveillance capabilities.  in a speech from the senate floor at the time, feingold raised concerns that one provision would allow the government to “go on a fishing expedition and collect information on virtually anyone.” leaks from snowden in 2013 showed the provision feingold questioned was later secretly interpreted to conduct bulk surveillance on u.s. phone metadata. that program was curtailed by congress in 2015. feingold “was a true leader in fighting indiscriminate mass surveillance of innocent americans,” u.s. senator ron wyden, an oregon democrat who also is among congressional skeptics of government spying, said in a statement. wisconsin typically leans democratic during high turnout presidential election years, a problem for johnson, who won by nearly 5 points in 2010 running as a small government outsider. “it was pretty clear that 2010 was a wave election and there was nothing that (feingold) could have done to fend off the challenge from ron johnson,” said kenneth mayer, a political science professor at the university of wisconsin madison. johnson has attempted to use feingold’s 18 year senate record to portray him as soft on national security. william allison, a johnson campaign spokesman, added that feingold had been “willing to completely mislead wisconsinites about his weak record on national security.” ",0

" cyber attacks using malware called  badrabbit  hit russia and other nations on tuesday, affecting russian interfax news agency and causing flight delays at ukraine s odessa airport. while no major outages were reported, the u.s. government issued a warning on the attack, which followed campaigns in may and june that used similar malware and resulted in what some economists estimated are billions of dollars in losses. the attacks are disturbing because attackers quickly infected critical infrastructure, including transportation operators, indicating it was a  well coordinated  campaign, said  robert lipovsky, a researcher with cyber firm eset. more than half the victims were in russia, followed by ukraine, bulgaria, turkey and japan, according to eset.  the u.s. department of homeland security issued a warning on the badrabbit ransomware, a type of virus that locks up infected computers and asks victims to pay a ransom to restore access. it did not identify any u.s. victims but advised the public to refrain from paying ransoms and report any infections to the federal bureau of investigation through the government s internet crime complaint center. ransomware infections have the potential to halt activity at targeted organizations. the may  wannacry  ransomware shuttered hospitals, factories and other facilities around the globe for days.  interfax, one of russia s largest news agencies, said some of its services were hit by the attack but expected them to be back online by the end of tuesday. an odessa airport spokesman said a few flights were delayed because workers had to process passenger data manually. kiev s metro system reported a hack on its payment system but said trains were running normally.  ukraine s cyber police chief told reuters the country was  barely affected.  russian cyber security firm kaspersky lab said badrabbit appeared to spread through a mechanism similar to june s destructive notpetya virus, which took down many ukrainian government agencies and businesses. it then spread across corporate networks of multinationals with operations or suppliers in eastern europe. kaspersky said it was investigating to see whether badrabbit was related to notpetya.  ukrainian banking services, which have been hit by previous attacks, were unaffected, according to the nation s central bank.

" the texas court of criminal appeals on wednesday dismissed an abuse of power indictment against rick perry, ending a case that dragged on the former texas governor’s unsuccessful bid for the 2016 republican presidential nomination. perry, who campaigned for the nomination in 2012 and 2016, faced a first degree felony charge in state courts that could have brought up to 99 years in prison because of a funding veto he made in 2013 seen as being intended to force a texas county district attorney to resign. “when the only act that is being prosecuted is a veto, then the prosecution itself violates separation of powers,” the court said. the longest serving governor in texas history, perry, 65, was indicted on the two charges in august 2014 by a grand jury in travis county, a democratic stronghold in the heavily republican state. “the court’s decision today proves that this indictment was nothing less than a baseless political attack,” perry told a news conference. “i have always known that the actions that i took were not only lawful and legal   they were right.” he first threatened and then vetoed $7.5 million for an integrity unit in the travis county district attorney’s office. many said perry played hardball politics to force out county district attorney rosemary lehmberg, a democrat, after she pleaded guilty to drunken driving. in july 2015, a texas state appeals court threw out a lesser charge against perry for coercion of a public official, leaving only the abuse of power charge. lawyers for perry, whose term ended at the start of 2015, have argued the governor was acting within his powers when he made the funding cut.  a prosecutor in the case said that perry acted unlawfully to pressure lehmberg by threatening the funding cut. lehmberg remained in office. in september 2015, perry, struggling to raise money and languishing near the bottom in presidential opinion polls, became the first member of the crowded republican field to drop out of the 2016 white house race. on the campaign trail, perry tried to rally support among republican voters by saying the indictment was the result of a partisan attack by democrats. analysts noted, however, the threat of a trial during his campaign likely scared away major donors, dooming a campaign seen as a long shot.  perry dropped out of a gaffe filled campaign for the 2012 republican presidential nomination.

" western countries are trying to push their culture and political values onto others, seducing them into abandoning their own, china s propaganda chief warned on friday, saying the country must follow its own path. chinese president xi jinping has overseen a sweeping crackdown against civil society since assuming office five years ago, tightening control over society, media and the internet. xi has pledged to promote what the ruling communist party refers to as core socialist values, which stress patriotism, chinese traditional culture, rule of law, harmony and prosperity among others. huang kunming, who was appointed to the post following last month s key party congress at which xi further cemented his grip on power, wrote in the official people s daily that there was an intensifying  surge and collision  in the world between different values.  there are especially some western countries who use their technological advantages and dominance of discourse that they have accumulated over a long period to peddle so called  universal values ,  he wrote. such countries, which huang did not name,  are trying to seduce people into  beautifying the west  and  being compliant with the west,  weakening or even abandoning their identification with their own spiritual culture,  he added. china s special cultural traditions, unique historical destiny and national situation mean it has to protect its own values rooted in its culture, huang said. only by promoting core socialist values can the chinese people stand tall in the  forest of the world s people , he added. china has long railed against those it says try to impose western concepts on the country, such as competitive multi party democracy or the separation of powers, and the communist party brooks no challenge to its power. on the eve of the party congress, state news agency xinhua attacked western democracy as divisive and confrontational. china s constitution enshrines the party s long term  leading  role in government, though it allows the existence of various other political parties under what is called a  multi party cooperation system . but all are subservient to the communist party. activists who call for pluralism are regularly jailed and criticism of china s authoritarian system silenced.

" saudi arabia lifted a 35 year old ban on cinemas on monday, prompting celebrations from film fans, directors and movie chains eyeing the last untapped mass market in the middle east. the first theaters could start showing films as early as march, the government said, part of a liberalizing reform drive that has already opened the door to concerts, comedy shows, and women drivers over the past year. cinemas were banned in the early 1980s under pressure from islamists as saudi society turned towards a particularly conservative form of the religion that discouraged public entertainment and public mixing between men and women. but reforms led by 32 year old crown prince mohammed bin salman have eased many of those restrictions, as the government tries to broaden the economy and lessen its dependence on oil.  opening cinemas will act as a catalyst for economic growth and diversification,  said minister of culture and information awwad bin saleh alawwad.  by developing the broader cultural sector we will create new employment and training opportunities, as well as enriching the kingdom s entertainment options.  in a nod to conservatives, the government said the films would be censored to make sure they remain  in line with values and principles in place and do not contradict with sharia laws and moral values in the kingdom.  the details of that censorship were not announced, but could be extensive in a country where images of women are often crossed out on advertising. there was no immediate reaction from the kingdom s wahhabi clergy and conservative groups, who have responded to past suggestions about bringing back cinema with outraged social media campaigns. public objections to the reforms have been more muted in recent months, after authorities launched a spate of arrests clamping down on critics of the program. up to now, the kingdom s film pioneers have had to focus on foreign markets to get their works shown.  saudi arabia is always in the news, but it s nice to be in the news in this way,  said los angeles based saudi director haifaa al manour, who released the first full length feature shot entirely in the kingdom, wadjda, in 2012.  i feel like we re about to relive what egypt was like in the  50s,  she said, referring to the explosion of film making in what is now the epicenter of arabic popular cinema. prince mohammed has also sought to promote a more tolerant form of islam and crack down on extremism, a cause mansour said would be furthered by films.  if you want to fight terrorism, you need to give people a love of life. a love of life comes from joy, and cinema is joy.  thousands of saudis currently travel to bahrain, the united arab emirates and other countries for their entertainment. the government has said it wants to retain the money spent on those trips. regional cinema chains have also been eyeing the saudi market, keen to tap the spending power of the young people who make up roughly 70 percent of the kingdom s population. dubai based mall operator majid al futtaim, which owns the vox cinemas chain, said it wanted to open the first movie theater there.  we are very happy about this announcement, as you can imagine, we have been waiting for it for quite some time,  said chief executive alain bejjani. the government said it expected to open more than 300 cinemas with more than 2,000 screens by 2030, building an industry that would contribute more then 90 billion riyals ($24 billion) to the economy and create 30,000 permanent jobs over the same period. a commission chaired by alawwad will announce details of licensing and regulations over the next few weeks, it added. locations for the first cinemas are still under study, but would likely be in top population centers, fahad al muammar, the supervisor of cinema in the kingdom s general commission for audiovisual media, told state tv al ekhbariya.

" the european union said on friday it understood the aim of u.s. missile strikes in syria as an effort to deter any more chemical attacks there, but highlighted political solutions as the only way to end the war. the nuanced line taken by the bloc’s 28 states reflects their disgust at a chemical attack that killed scores of people in a rebel held area this week, but also a worry about any more escalation in the conflict following the unilateral u.s. move. “the u.s. has informed the european union that ... (it) launched a strike on shayrat airfield in syria with the understandable intention to prevent and deter the spread and use of deadly chemical weapons,” the bloc’s top diplomat, federica mogherini, said in a statement on behalf of all member states. “the u.s. also informed us that these strikes are limited and focused on preventing and deterring further use of chemical weapons atrocities,” the statement read. she added that the use of chemical weapons was a war crime and perpetrators of such acts “should be sanctioned within the framework of the united nations.” the bloc supports syrian opposition rebels and some moderate rebels negotiating under u.n. mediated talks with representatives of damascus. the talks have long been stalled and the war, which is in its seventh year, has killed more than 400,000 people and sent millions from their homes. “the eu firmly believes that there can be no military solution to the conflict,” the joint statement said. “only a credible political solution... will ensure peace and stability.” while france and britain have led calls for syrian president bashar al assad to go, some other eu states, including the czech republic, hungary, spain and italy, are more dovish. but the bloc’s role in international peace efforts has been largely marginal as it lacks influence on the ground, where russia’s military intervention has given assad the upper hand. the eu is the largest aid donor in syria, and has threatened it will not pay for reconstruction of the country if assad and his allies take full control by wiping out the opposition.  the eu says a “credible political transition” must start first with the aim of giving the opposition and syria’s various ethnic and religious groups political representation. the chairman of eu leaders donald tusk, french foreign minister jean marc ayrault, the polish foreign ministry as well as a british government spokesman supported washington.  “u.s. strikes show needed resolve against barbaric chemical attacks. eu will work with the us to end brutality in syria,” tusk said on twitter. but german foreign minister sigmar gabriel, belgium’s didier reynders and the head of the eu’s executive arm stuck to a more cautious line, saying they “understood” the aim of the strikes, but highlighting more strongly the need for a negotiated end to the war. “there is a clear distinction between air strikes on military targets and the use of chemical weapons against civilians,” said the head of the european commission, jean claude juncker. “efforts to stem the spiral of violence in syria and work toward a lasting peace should be redoubled. only a political transition can lead to such an outcome.”     ",0
" brazil s top prosecutor on tuesday charged former presidents luis inacio lula da silva and dilma rousseff along with fellow  workers party members with forming a criminal organization, the latest accusations in brazil s sprawling corruption scandal. the prosecutor, rodrigo janot, alleged that eight members of the workers party, including lula and rousseff, committed a series of crimes involving state owned oil firm petrobras such as cartel formation, corruption and money laundering. they were the first criminal charges to be leveled against rousseff, who was impeached in 2016 for breaking budgetary laws. the 230 page document filed with the supreme court accused lula of heading the organization. lula s lawyer said the law was being misused to persecute the former president. the workers party said in a statement that the charges were baseless and being used to divert attention from other investigations, including one into a former federal prosecutor, referring to a case janot announced on monday. a representative for rousseff said the prosecutor s office had offered no evidence of the crimes and called on the supreme court to guarantee the right to defend against them.  lula, who is still brazil s most popular politician, is appealing a corruption conviction that would bar him from running for president in 2018. he faces four other corruption trials. the charges stem from the operation car wash investigation that uncovered a cartel of companies paying bribes to officials to secure petrobras contracts, revelations that have spawned a host of investigations that has shaken brazil s political system and economy.

" the saudi led military coalition fighting against yemen s houthi movement reopened a land border crossing, partly easing a blockade imposed earlier this week, but aid agencies warned of famine and a health catastrophe if other ports stay shut.  the coalition said on monday it would close all air, land and sea ports in yemen to stem the flow of arms to the houthis from iran, after saudi arabia intercepted a missile fired toward its capital riyadh. the al wadea border crossing, linking saudi arabia with territory in eastern yemen controlled by the saudi backed government, was reopened on thursday, a yemeni official and witnesses said, letting food and other supplies across. the united nations has said that a total blockade of yemen could cause a famine that could kill millions. the government held southern port of aden was reopened on wednesday, but ports in houthi held areas are still shut. the houthis, drawn mainly from yemen s zaidi shi ite minority and allied to long serving former president ali abdullah saleh, control much of the country including the capital san aa. saudi arabia and its arab allies have been waging war against them on behalf of the government of president abd rabbu mansour hadi, based in aden. the saudis and their allies say the houthis get weapons from their arch foe, iran. iran denies arming the houthis and blames the conflict in yemen on riyadh. yemen s stocks of fuel and vaccines will run out in a month unless the saudi led coalition allows aid into the blockaded port of hodeidah and the airport at san aa, unicef s representative in the country said on friday. meritxell relano, speaking by phone to reporters in geneva, said fuel prices had risen 60 percent and there were urgent concerns about a diphtheria outbreak, as well as food shortages because of the port closure.  the situation that was already catastrophic is just getting worse,  she said.  the impact of this is unimaginable in terms of health and diseases.  after two years of civil war, yemen has 7 million people on the brink of famine and has had 900,000 suspected cholera cases in the past six months.  united nations aid chief mark lowcock said on wednesday that if the coalition did not allow humanitarian aid access to yemen, it would cause  the largest famine the world has seen for many decades, with millions of victims.  the cholera epidemic had abated in recent weeks with the number of cases slowing amid a major push to fight the disease. but the world health organization said the progress could be reversed by the blockade.  if the closure is not stopped in the coming days, we may see that the progress is stopped,  who spokeswoman fadela chaib told a briefing in geneva.  we can see even more cases and more deaths as a result of not being able to get access to people.  the closure of hodeidah port prevented a ship setting sail from djibouti with 250 tonnes of who medical supplies on wednesday. trauma kits in particular are running short.   if the hostilities continue and the ports remain closed, we will not be able to perform life saving surgeries or provide basic healthcare,  chaib said.  germany will double its aid to unicef for yemen to 20 million euros this year to help deal with looming famine, bringing its total annual aid to yemen to 70 million, a spokeswoman for the development ministry said on friday.  the suffering of the people in yemen is inconceivable and it threatens to become much worse,  development minister gerd mueller told passauer neue presse newspaper.  we must act now to prevent the death by starvation of millions of women, children and men.

" philippine president rodrigo duterte has declared a 10 day unilateral ceasefire with communist rebels to allow filipinos to celebrate a  stress free  christmas season, two weeks after peace talks with the insurgents were formally scrapped. presidential spokesman harry roque said duterte had ordered the army and police to suspend offensive operations from dec. 24 to jan. 2  to lessen the apprehension of the public this christmas season . he said he expected the maoists and their political leaders to  do a similar gesture of goodwill.  there was no immediate comment from the communist rebel movement, whose top leaders and negotiators have been living in exile in the netherlands since the late 1980s. duterte restarted a stalled peace process and freed several communist leaders as a gesture of good faith when he came to office last year but he recently abandoned talks due to escalating rebel attacks.  he has vented his fury on a near daily basis at what he considers duplicity by the communist party of the philippines (cpp) and its armed wing, the new people s army (npa). he has collectively declared them a  terrorist organization  and has ended the three decades peace process. the rebel forces, estimated to number around 3,000, have been waging a protracted guerrilla warfare in the countryside for nearly 50 years in a conflict that has killed more than 40,000 people and stifled growth in resource rich areas of the philippines. the guerrillas have been targeting mines, plantations, construction and telecommunication companies, demanding  revolutionary taxation  to finance arms purchases and recruitment activities. duterte on tuesday night said he only wanted filipinos to celebrate a  stress free  christmas.  i do not want to add more strain to what people are now suffering,  he told reporters.

" france opened a counter terrorism inquiry after a man wielding a knife attacked a soldier in a paris subway station on friday, the latest incident targeting troops protecting the capital s transport hubs and tourist sites. paris and other european capitals are on high alert after a wave of attacks in past years by islamist militants, many of them inspired by islamic state. the paris incident occurred hours before several people were hurt at a london underground station. witnesses reported a blast which police were treating as a terrorism incident.  the assailant in paris was wrestled to the ground and arrested. the soldier, part of operation sentinel, a force deployed in the wake of lethal islamist attacks on france, escaped unhurt. police said the attack happened just before 6.30 a.m. (0430 gmt) as the morning rush hour got under way at the chatelet subway station, where tens of thousands of commuters converge from paris s sprawling suburbs every day. government spokesman christophe castaner said the investigation was being handled by counter terrorism specialists.  a source close to the investigation said the assailant was moroccan born and about 40 years old, with no known criminal background. police raids at an address linked to the suspect were ongoing, the source added.  there have been more than half a dozen attacks against troops belonging to operation sentinel. in early august, a man rammed his car into a group of soldiers on patrol in the wealthy paris suburb of levallois perret.  france announced on thursday that the 7,000 strong force was being adapted to make it more mobile and its movements less predictable. days earlier, interior minister gerard collomb said security agencies had thwarted several bigger plots this year, including one plan to strike a paris night club in late august.  islamist militants have killed more than 230 people in a wave of attacks on french soil since early 2015 and dozens more have been killed in attacks in london, manchester and brussels. french war planes have carried out bombing raids against islamic state strongholds in syria and iraq and the militant group has urged its followers to target france.  french media said the chatelet aggressor shouted references to islamic state as he attacked the soldier.

" a former u.s. representative whose lavish washington office raised questions about use of taxpayer money pleaded not guilty on monday to charges of defrauding the federal government and campaign committees, then trying to cover it up. aaron schock, a 35 year old former republican congressman from illinois, was indicted in november by the u.s. department of justice on 24 counts, including wire fraud, theft of government funds and filing false federal income tax returns. he entered his plea in a federal court in springfield, illinois. “i look forward to the truth and all the facts coming out in this case. i have complete faith in my legal team, the good people of this community, and that justice will ultimately prevail,” schock said in an emailed statement. schock, elected to the, u.s. house of representatives in 2008 at the age of 27, gained a following by posting flashy photos on social media of himself traveling around the world.  but he was hounded with questions after the washington post reported last year about lavish decorations in his capitol hill office based on the pbs period melodrama “downton abbey.”  although staff told the post that the interior design work had been done for free, the story prompted more investigations into schock’s spending habits, with several media outlets reporting he failed to disclose some expenditures and had to repay others after improperly using taxpayer funds.

" the european union wants a transition period after brexit to end no later than the last day of 2020, according to the european commission s negotiating directives agreed on wednesday. that date, coinciding with the end of the eu s seven year budget period and 21 months after britain departs the eu, had long been expected as the target end point of the transition. but this was the first official confirmation that it is the goal of the union s negotiators. british prime minister theresa may had sought a transition lasting around two years. eu chief negotiator michel barnier, speaking at a news conference after the eu executive had agreed the terms, said the 2020 deadline was logical and would avoid complications in the next 2021 2027 eu budget period.  the four pages of new directives for barnier were in line with guidelines issued by eu leaders at a summit on friday and will form the basis of talks on the transition that he hopes to start next month. he has said in the past he hopes a free trade pact could be ready to take effect in january 2021. the directives spell out that britain will effectively remain in eu institutions, bound by all their rules including new ones, while not having a say in their making.  the eu will also offer britain a non voting place at some meetings where decisions may affect specific issues and will set up special arrangements for a uk role in setting annual eu fishing quotas. the directives also spell out more clearly that eu treaties with other countries and international organizations will no longer apply to britain during the transition period.  however, the document adds:  where it is in the interest of the union, the union may consider whether and how arrangements can be agreed that would maintain the effects of the agreements as regards the united kingdom during the transition period.      this has been important to britain since it could mean that it no longer benefits automatically from free trade agreements which the eu has with, say, canada or south korea, while it would still have to apply eu trade policy   for example collecting eu customs duty at uk ports. barnier said he understood that britain was working with other countries to try to retain the advantages of some of the nearly 750 international agreements to which london is currently party as an eu member. among elements spelled out more in the directives than in the leaders  guidelines last week was a repetition of a previously agreed eu position that everything applying to brexit for britain would also apply to other british territories. brussels has said the spanish government must agree any future arrangements with britain that affect the british territory of gibraltar on spain s southern coast. asked about his previously expressed view that a future trade deal may offer little automatic access for the city of london s financial services firms to the eu market, barnier repeated that free access would be unprecedented as far as he was aware.  i remind you that i m not aware of any free trade deal in the past between the european union and third countries that would have allowed privileged access for financial services,  he told a news conference.  british negotiators have said britain s size and proximity give it the leverage to negotiate a more ambitious relationship with the eu than any other state. during the transition, britain will maintain access to the european single market, barnier added.  britain will keep all the benefits, but also all the obligations of the single market, the customs union and the common policies,  he said, ruling out  a la carte  terms. barnier welcomed agreements made earlier this month on issues such as the irish border, citizens  rights and the divorce settlement.  we are not at the end of the road,  he said.  but it is an important stage of this road towards an orderly withdrawal rather than a disorderly one.

" seven u.s. states are still without budgets, nearly a week into the new fiscal year that started july 1.  legislatures in connecticut, illinois, massachusetts, pennsylvania, oregon, rhode island and wisconsin remain in disagreement about how to close ongoing budget gaps in their states or fund new budget initiatives. “we always have some states that go into the new fiscal year without budgets, but the number is a bit high this year,” said eric kim, a director at fitch ratings.  weak revenues complicated budget negotiations in several states, while idiosyncratic issues pushed others beyond their june 30 deadlines.  the illinois house was poised to take final budget action on thursday by attempting to override the governor’s vetoes of a $36 billion spending plan and $5 billion tax hike approved by the democratic controlled legislature over the fourth of july holiday weekend. a hazardous materials situation in the state capitol in springfield delayed the house session, but officials determined the substance was harmless and lawmakers were returning.  if enacted, the budget would mark illinois’ first complete budget since 2015. no other u.s. state has lacked a budget for that long. thirty three of the 50 u.s. states reported revenues that came in below projections in fiscal year 2017, the highest number of states since the recession decimated budgets in 2010, according to the national association of state budget officers. connecticut and pennsylvania have the most challenging revenue situations, according to fitch, as lower than anticipated tax collections exacerbated budget gaps and led to disputes over how to close them.  massachusetts, also amid a revenue shortfall, enacted a one month interim budget for july to provide additional time to negotiate a full year budget. wisconsin legislators are working to close a transportation funding shortfall.  oregon’s budget process includes multiple bills, most of which have been approved. but the legislature is still debating several measures, including changes to hiring practices. rhode island had appeared ready to finalize a budget by june 30, but late last week the state senate amended a house proposal to phase out an automobile tax, causing the house to halt the budget process.  many states retain the authority to make debt service payments without enacted budgets. over the holiday weekend, several states came to last minute budget agreements.  new jersey and maine ended partial government shutdowns just in time for the fourth of july holiday on tuesday, while governors of washington state and alaska signed new operating budgets late last week, hours before deadlines that would have triggered partial government shutdowns.

" honduran security forces fanned out on saturday to enforce a curfew as sporadic demonstrations continued over a contested presidential election that triggered violent protests that have killed at least three people.  hundreds have been arrested after the tally from last sunday s presidential race stalled without a clear winner. opposition leaders accused the government of trying to steal the election tv star salvador nasralla on saturday accused his rival, president juan orlando hernandez, of carrying out a  coup  by manipulating the vote count and declaring the curfew to stifle protests. international concern has grown about the electoral crisis in the poor central american country, which struggles with violent drug gangs and one of the world s highest murder rates.     lines formed at supermarkets and early saturday as people stocked up on supplies, but upscale malls and many shops were shuttered while others closed early as groups of workers waited to catch buses and get back to their homes before the 6 p.m. to 6 a.m. curfew took effect.  i m afraid i m going to get arrested by the army and be stuck in jail overnight or hit a blockade in the streets,  said daniel solorzono, 27, as he heaved eggs, bananas and sausage into his pick up truck at a market and rushed off to his home. nasralla s early 5 percentage point lead on monday was later reversed, after a pause of more than a day in the count, in favor of hernandez, leading to accusations of vote fraud and calls for protests. disputed votes could swing the outcome.  under the official count, hernandez had 42.9 percent of the vote while nasralla has 41.4 percent, with 95 percent of votes tallied. electoral authorities have proposed recounting around 6 percent of the vote, but nasralla s party has demanded a wider recount, forcing a stand off with the ruling party and election authorities. heide fulton, the top official at the u.s. embassy which does not currently have an ambassador, called for hondurans to refrain from violence.  the supreme electoral tribunal must have the time and space to count all votes transparently and free from interference,  she said on saturday in a post on twitter.   one man was killed in the port city of la ceiba on friday and a 19 year old woman was shot in the head early saturday in tegucigalpa as soldiers busted up protesters  blockades of rubble and burning tires that had snarled traffic in the capital and major ports, a spokesman for the national police said.  on friday, police had reported another protestor was killed in la ceiba.  there were also reports from opposition leaders and a police source that between four and five demonstrators had been shot dead in the north of the country. while security forces cleared blockades in the capital, there were still highways obstructed around la ceiba and other areas outside major cities, a police spokesman said. more than 200 people have been arrested and more than 20 injuries have been reported in the skirmishes between protesters and security forces.  thirty four people who were detained during the week would be charged with terrorism, said col. jorge paz, a spokesman for the military. the government declared the curfew on friday, expanding powers for the army and police to detain people and break up blockades of roads, bridges and public buildings. the electoral tribunal was unable to resume the vote tally on saturday as nasralla s center left alliance refused to participate unless the recount was expanded to three regions with alleged vote tampering.  the tribunal said it would try to carry out the recount of disputed votes on sunday and that it hoped the opposition would participate. its top official said they would evaluate if the recount could be widened.     what everyone already knows is that a coup occurred in honduras last night precisely in the processing of the ballots. so, the whole world will not recognize these elections,  nasralla told local television. the 64 year old nasralla is one of honduras  best known faces and he is backed by former president manuel zelaya, a leftist ousted in a coup in 2009.  hernandez, 49, implemented a military led crackdown on gang violence that was backed by the united states and is credited with curbing the country s murder rate.

" legislation approved by michigan lawmakers on thursday to bail out the detroit public schools (dps) will keep the district operating, but falls short on funding to fix its crumbling buildings, according to school officials. the bill package, approved over objections by democratic lawmakers, creates a new, debt free district governed by an elected school board, while leaving the current district in place solely to levy property taxes to pay off outstanding debt. dps, which has nearly 46,000 students, has been under state control since 2009 because of a financial emergency. the american federation of teachers michigan and detroit federation of teachers criticized the lack of a bipartisan compromise in a joint statement on thursday. “these bills are a statement by non detroit republicans that they know what is best for detroit, a city that is overwhelmingly people of color,” the groups said. “it has been this attitude that resulted in detroit public schools’ massive debt, low academic performance and a ‘wild west’ system of school openings.” under the measures approved on thursday, michigan would commit $617 million from the state’s share of a tobacco settlement in annual increments of $72 million for the new detroit community school district. an emergency state loan for transition costs was capped at $150 million, with only $25 million of that amount available for capital improvements, less than the overall $200 million sought by dps. “we also look forward to working creatively with the governor’s office, the state superintendent, and the michigan department of education to identify the remainder of the critical resources necessary to educate our students,” dps state appointed transition manager steven rhodes said in a statement. a smaller bailout passed by the house in may raised concerns that dps would run out of cash later this summer. republican lawmakers contended the final $617 million bailout legislation would prevent dps from filing for municipal bankruptcy even though rhodes, a former federal bankruptcy judge, has said such a move would be ineffective because much of the district’s debt is guaranteed by the state. democrats objected to the absence of a detroit education commission to oversee the opening and closing of public and charter schools in detroit. the house and senate approved the package with a series of votes late wednesday and early thursday, sending the legislation to the desk of republican governor rick snyder, who signaled in a statement that he supports it.

" the united states’ first tax overhaul in decades may not pass congress until well into 2017, house of representatives speaker paul ryan said on wednesday, in a sign the timetable for the legislation has been pushed back. revamping the u.s. tax code has become a new legislative test for president donald trump after a republican push to repeal former president barack obama’s signature healthcare law failed last month in a humiliating defeat for the party. some republicans in congress had hoped to pass the tax overhaul before august, but party divisions over the legislation and difficulties in replacing obamacare have slowed the process. “this will be done in 2017, that is our time line, we would like to get it done as soon as possible,” ryan told reporters during a visit to london that was part of a multi nation trip aimed at strengthening u.s. economic and security ties with nato allies. ryan added: “as soon as possible for us is by the end of summer but we’re going to take our time to get it right. we can clearly get this done by the end of summer but if it needs to go a little longer, we’ll do that.” trump made tax reform a core campaign promise, saying he would simplify the tax code and cut tax rates in ways that could significantly increase government debt.  to tackle the biggest overhaul of the u.s. tax code since the reagan era, house republicans need to avoid the political fault lines that sank their healthcare bill, partly by having conservatives on board. ryan has been pushing a plan that includes a border adjustment tax, or bat, that would levy a 20 percent tax on imported goods. the provision has been attacked by some conservatives and democrats who argue it would hurt consumers and some u.s. companies reliant on foreign goods. the senate has been awaiting action by the house before considering tax legislation. given the republican divisions, the white house has said it would submit its own tax proposal to congress but it was unclear when that might arrive. treasury secretary steven mnuchin said this week that tax reform may not get done before an august deadline.  the trump administration might also include a $1 trillion infrastructure investment plan in whatever tax bill it submits to congress.

" russian and north korean officials will meet in moscow on friday to discuss the north korea crisis, a move welcomed by the united states, which has been locked in am increasingly heated war of words with pyongyang over its nuclear and missile programs. russia s foreign ministry said oleg burmistrov, russia s ambassador at large, would meet choe son hui, director general of the north american department of north korea s foreign ministry. foreign ministry spokeswoman maria zakharova declined to give details, but said her ministry would issue a statement after the meeting. the united states welcomed the planned meeting, with u.s. state department spokeswoman heather nauert saying:  i can t see that as a bad thing.   diplomacy is our preferred approach,  nauert told a regular briefing.  if russia can be successful in getting north korea to move in a better direction, we would certainly welcome that.  privately, however, u.s. officials have played down the likely effect of the russian effort. recent days have seen exchanges of heated rhetoric and threats between u.s. president donald trump s administration and north korea over the latter s bid to develop nuclear tipped missiles capable of hitting the united states. nauert said friday s talks would follow a visit to moscow by the u.s. special envoy for north korea, joseph yun, about two weeks ago. attending the u.n. general assembly in new york last week, russian foreign minister sergei lavrov pushed a proposal by moscow and beijing for a dual suspension of north korean weapons tests and the u.s. south korean military drills to kick start negotiations. he suggested then that a neutral european country could mediate. washington has said its joint military drills are essential to guard against north korea and that pyongyang must show it is serious about giving up its nuclear weapons before any return to talks. north korea, for its part, says it needs to develop its weapons to defend itself against what it sees as u.s. aggression. last week, lavrov said north korea and the united states should tone down their bellicose rhetoric, calling the exchange of threats between the two  quite bad, unacceptable.

" a coalition of nonprofit groups on monday sued the u.s. department of homeland security to obtain logs of visitors to president donald trump’s homes. the lawsuit accused the secret service, which maintains the logs, of violating the law by ignoring several requests for lists of visitors to the white house, trump tower in manhattan, and the mar a lago estate in palm beach, florida. monday’s complaint was filed in manhattan federal court by the citizens for responsibility and ethics in washington (crew), the knight first amendment institute at columbia university, the national security archive, and archive researcher kate doyle. the plaintiffs had requested the logs under the federal freedom of information act. similar litigation by crew in 2009 prompted the obama administration to disclose white house visitor logs on a delayed basis, and according to the complaint led to the release of 5.99 million records. a spokesman for the homeland security department, which oversees the secret service, said the department does not discuss pending litigation. the lawsuit was reported earlier by the washington post. the website where white house visitor logs were available went dark after trump became president. that page now reads: ""this page is being updated. it will post records of white house visitors on an ongoing basis, once they become available."" (here) several democratic lawmakers last month called on trump, a republican, to make logs public again. many foia lawsuits against federal agencies are filed in washington rather than new york. but in august 2013, the federal appeals court in washington said congress did not intend to authorize foia requesters to obtain records “indirectly” from the secret service that they could not obtain directly from the president. that decision involved a request by the conservative group judicial watch for records of all white house visitors over seven months. it was written by chief judge merrick garland, whose supreme court nomination by obama was never acted upon by congress. federal judges in manhattan can use garland’s opinion for guidance, but need not follow it. the case is doyle et al v. u.s. department of homeland security, u.s. district court, southern district of new york, no. 17 02542.

"this is a great story for anyone who doesn t understand the power one liberal judge can wield from the bench. u.s. district judge robart, who is presiding over a 2012 consent decree requiring the city to adopt reforms to address federal allegations of police bias, rebuked the seattle police union for holding up reforms as it bargains over a new contract, the seattle times reported. the court and the citizens of seattle will not be held hostage for increased payments and benefits,  the judge said, according to the paper. to hide behind a collective-bargaining agreement is not going to work,  he said.kevin stuckey, who recently became president of the seattle police officers  guild, said the union is prepared to sit down with the city and reach a deal.judge robart, a george w. bush appointee, said proposed police reform legislation should include putting a civilian in charge of police oversight, shutting down a police-led disciplinary board and creating a civilian position of inspector general.judge robart threatened to call a hearing and override the city s bargaining process with the union if he concluded the union was interfering with reform, the times reported. the judge ended monday s hearing by citing a statistic that claimed 41 percent of the shootings nationwide by police were of blacks.  black lives matter,  he said, drawing an audible reaction in a courtroom, the times reported.judge robart added that the recent targeted shootings of police officers across the country signaled the importance of strengthening police and community relations.commissioner enrique gonzalez said he s  very encouraged that a federal judge has actually said that black lives matter, because now we know that not only is this movement happening in the streets   even a federal judge has acknowledged that people of color have been on the receiving end of police brutality and this needs to change,  the stranger reported.  washington times",1
" thousands of migrants displaced by fighting on libya s northwestern coast are in urgent need of medical help, the head of a detention center in the town of gharyan said on thursday, describing their situation as  tragic . some 5,800 migrants had arrived at the center since fighting broke out last month in the coastal city of sabratha, previously a launch pad for crossings to italy. about 2,000 people have already been sent on from gharyan to other centers in the capital, tripoli.  the situation is very tragic...disastrous. there s a lack of support,  said abdulhameed muftah, who runs al hamra dentition center in gharyan, about 80 km (50 miles) south of tripoli.  the clashes in sabratha resulted in the withdrawal of an armed group that said it had begun blocking migrant departures from sabratha, under intense pressure from italy. sabratha was previously the foremost smuggling hub for migrants attempting to cross the mediterranean. u.n. agencies have been struggling to provide support for thousands of mainly sub saharan african migrants stranded after the fighting.  many have been taken to centers such as the one in gharyan, which are nominally controlled by the u.n. backed government but notorious for widespread abuse and poor conditions. humanitarian workers have limited access. al hamra consists of about a dozen hangars, each meant to hold up to 150 people.  about 70 percent of the migrants brought to the center needed medical attention and were not receiving it, muftah said. one migrant clinging to the bars of the door of one the hangars called out as a reporter passed, saying  please. we re dying, we re dying . muftah said there were many children and some pregnant women in the center, several of whom had given birth since arriving.  we appeal to all international organizations and the libyan state to consider the humanitarian condition of these migrants,  he said. the condition of migrants was also raised with libyan authorities by the u.n. high commissioner for human rights, zeid ra ad al hussein, who visited libya on tuesday.   i call on the government to establish alternatives to detention in libya, to halt the practice of arbitrary detention, and to ensure accountability for the abuses perpetrated against migrants in detention centers,  he said in a statement on thursday. he called for human rights monitors to be given access to detention centers where thousands of libyans have been held for years without judicial process, citing  horrific reports  emerging from some of them.

" president donald trump is discussing border security and other measures that the white house wants to see included in an immigration bill during a dinner with republican lawmakers on monday, an administration official said. legal authority to close border security “loopholes” and other immigration reform measures were on the agenda for the dinner between trump and house of representatives majority leader kevin mccarthy and house judiciary committee chairman bob goodlatte, the official said. other attendees included senator john cornyn, the no. 2 senate republican, and senators tom cotton of arkansas and david perdue of georgia.  the white house dinner could influence the broad principles on immigration reform that trump’s team is planning to release in the future, the official said. trump and other top administration officials have urged conservative republicans in congress to craft legislation protecting “dreamers” brought illegally to the united states as children. trump held a similar dinner with the top democrats in congress, senator chuck schumer and representative nancy pelosi, last month to discuss legislation that would shield from deportation the roughly 800,000 young immigrants known as dreamers. the white house is eager to involve republicans in the process so as not to alienate trump’s political base.  the republican president has taken a hard line on immigration both as a presidential candidate and since entering office in january. but he has sought a legislative solution to help the young immigrants after ending a program started under former democratic president barack obama that allowed the dreamers to remain in the country.

" president barack obama’s white house set up one last fight with the republican controlled congress over defense spending on monday, threatening to veto a 2017 defense authorization bill over its use of special war funds for day to day military programs. the house of representatives draft of the $602 billion national defense authorization act, or ndaa, which sets spending policy for the department of defense, would shift $18 billion of wartime overseas contingency operations, or oco, funds to avoid automatic budget cuts to military programs. the obama administration objects to the use of that money, saying it threatens u.s. security and unfairly spares the pentagon from cuts faced by important civilian programs such as medical research and education. “by gambling with warfighting funds, the bill risks the safety of our men and women fighting to keep america safe, undercuts stable planning and efficient use of taxpayer dollars, dispirits troops and their families, baffles our allies, and emboldens our enemies,” the white house said in a statement. house republicans say the spending plan is essential to ensure that the military has the resources it needs, as it wages wars in afghanistan and against islamic state militants in iraq and syria. the obama administration also objected to a long list of policy provisions in the bill, including measures making it more difficult to close the detention center at guantanamo bay in cuba and cuts in funding for programs to train and equip local fighters in iraq and syria. obama vetoed one version of the 2016 ndaa over its use of oco funding and the guantanamo restrictions. he later signed a modified version that addressed his budget concerns but left the guantanamo measures in place. it will be months before the legislation passes congress and arrives on obama’s desk. the house draft has passed the house armed services committee, and republican leaders would like a vote by the full house as soon as wednesday. however, lawmakers have offered 375 amendments on a huge range of issues. the rules committee was meeting late on monday to decide which of those amendments might come up for a vote. the senate is also drafting its version of the ndaa, which must be reconciled with the house’s before being subject to vote in both chambers. if passed, that version would be sent to the white house for obama’s signature, or veto.

" a staff writer for the trump organization took responsibility on wednesday for the “chaos” caused by a speech given by the wife of u.s. republican presidential candidate donald trump that drew accusations of plagiarism and cast a shadow over the party’s convention this week. the writer, meredith mciver, apologized and offered an explanation that threw into sharp relief two days of efforts by the trump campaign to deny there had been a problem with melania trump’s speech on monday night. the republican convention in cleveland, which formally anointed trump on tuesday as the party nominee for the nov. 8 presidential election, was meant to be an occasion for the party to rally around its unorthodox white house candidate after a bitterly divisive primary campaign. but the accusations of plagiarism, and the trump campaign’s responses to them, have been a major talking point just as the party tries to showcase a candidate who it believes can appeal to voters and a campaign operation capable of beating democratic candidate hillary clinton in the nov. 8 election. in a statement, mciver said she had inserted passages into the melania trump speech that resembled parts of a 2008 speech by first lady michelle obama to the 2008 democratic national convention, when barack obama was in his first campaign for the presidency. mciver said she had offered to resign over the speech controversy, but trump and his family had rejected the offer.  the trump organization is owned by donald trump. trump defended mciver in an abc news interview on wednesday, saying: “she made a mistake. people make mistakes. you’ve made mistakes. we all make mistakes.” he said mciver had been with him for a long time and was a “good person.” trump added: “i thought it was terrific the way she came forward and just said, ‘look, it was a mistake that i made.’ she thought it was very unfair to melania.” in her speech on monday, melania trump spoke of passing on to the next generation the value of hard work that she inherited from her parents and said that “the only limit to your achievements is the strength of your dreams and your willingness to work for them.” “my parents impressed on me the values that you work hard for what you want in life; that your word is your bond and you do what you say and keep your promise; that you treat people with respect,” melania trump told the cleveland convention. in denver eight years ago, michelle obama said she and her husband, barack, “were raised with so many of the same values: that you work hard for what you want in life; that your word is your bond and you do what you say you’re going to do; that you treat people with dignity and respect.”     mciver said melania trump had read passages from michelle obama’s speech over the phone to her as examples. mciver then wrote them down and later included some of the phrasing in a draft that became melania trump’s speech. mciver said in her statement that michelle obama is a person melania trump “has always liked.”  “i did not check mrs. obama’s speeches. this was my mistake and i feel terrible for the chaos i have caused melania and the trumps, as well as to mrs. obama. no harm was meant,” mciver said. nowhere in the statement by mciver and comments by trump campaign officials on the speech has there been any sense of irony that the wife of the republican nominee was inspired by the words of michelle obama at the same time that speaker after speaker at the republican convention, echoing trump, assailed her husband’s policies. democrats have seized on the similarities in the speech and the trump campaign’s various explanations over the ensuing 48 hours as showing that his team is not ready for prime time. the charge was all the more embarrassing because trump has repeatedly slammed clinton as untrustworthy. white house spokesman josh earnest said on wednesday the similarities showed the country’s values were largely shared, even if political leaders had differences. “that certainly buttresses an argument that the president has been making quite frequently of late, about the country not being as divided as it might seem,” earnest told reporters.  questions have lingered over why the trump campaign had not run simple plagiarism software that is commonly used to ensure that speakers do not inadvertently lift other people’s words, and why the campaign sought to deny and brush away the problem. republican strategist ted newton, president of gravity strategic communications and a staffer in republican mitt romney’s failed 2012 presidential campaign, said the trump campaign should have come clean much sooner. “it sort of reflects the old adage: it’s not the crime, it’s the cover up,” newton said. “to have it bungled so badly is really a shame and sad for her.” if the campaign had admitted what happened sooner, newton said, “it would have been a bump in the road.” hours before giving the speech, melania trump, a slovenian born jewelry designer and former model, told nbc’s “today” that she had written it with as little help as possible. but her husband’s campaign manager, paul manafort, told cbs’ “this morning” on tuesday that it was a collaboration with speech writers. as late as wednesday, just hours before mciver’s statement, manafort was pressed again on the issue on cnn. he did not say words had been lifted from the michelle obama speech and sought to stress the overall effectiveness of the speech. “the controversy that you’re talking about is not meaningful at all,” he said.  mciver is listed as a writer on some of trump’s most popular books, including “trump: how to get rich” and “trump: think like a billionaire.” her author’s biography in “how to get rich” says she was a ford foundation scholar who graduated from the university of utah, as well as a member of the trump organization.

" chicago is starting an advertising campaign to reassure immigrants that they are welcome in the third largest u.s. city, in a show of defiance to a crackdown by president donald trump on people who have entered the country illegally. mayor rahm emanuel said on monday he was not worried about the “one chicago” campaign upsetting the trump administration. starting this week, signs will appear at more than 200 locations including digital billboards, trains and newspaper racks with photos of chicago immigrants highlighting the diversity of their backgrounds. radio and tv spots will start this week with similar stories. a new website, onechi.org, features links for free legal aid and “know your rights” training.the campaign’s slogan is “three million residents, three million stories, one chicago.”  the mayor’s office said the campaign was costing taxpayers nothing. the advertising was designed on a pro bono basis by the ad agency ogilvy chicago and uses city owned public service advertising space. “i’m not worried because we’re not only on firm legal ground but firm moral ground,” emanuel said. “we’re all immigrants and we’re not going to let them divide us and say that person is not allowed here.” trump already has threatened to withhold federal funds from cities such as chicago that offer sanctuary to illegal immigrants who commit no serious crimes. the justice department in april singled out chicago and new york, saying they were “crumbling under the weight of illegal immigration and violent crime,” even though experts say illegal immigration had little to do with chicago’s spike in murders. last month, a u.s. judge blocked a portion of trump’s executive order that sought to withhold most federal funds from so called sanctuary cities as part of the administration’s efforts to toughen immigration enforcement. u.s. attorney general jeff sessions issued a memo on monday saying that only department of justice and homeland security grants would be at risk for cities that “willfully refuse” to comply with federal law. sanctuary cities generally offer safe harbor to illegal immigrants and often do not use municipal funds or resources to advance the enforcement of federal immigration laws. emanuel, whose grandparents came to the united states as immigrants from moldova, said the campaign was meant to reassure those feeling frightened about deportation. chicago officials estimates there are about 300,000 undocumented immigrants in the city. “i see it with kids all across chicago – they are nervous about their parents and nervous about their own safety because of the government and the rhetoric,” he said.

" russia accused the united states of denying entry to a senior military official to conduct a joint russian and chinese briefing at the united nations on thursday that criticized u.s. missile defense systems as a global threat. u.s. disarmament ambassador robert wood and jeffrey eberhardt, of the state department office of multilateral and nuclear affairs, walked out of the briefing within minutes of it starting in a conference room at u.n. headquarters in new york. alexander emelianov, from the russian defense ministry international cooperation committee, said moscow had wanted to send a delegation led by lieutenant general tretyak andrey, russian armed forces chief of the general staff advisers group.  the entry visa was not given to them,  emelianov told the few dozen diplomats attending the half hour briefing.  the u.s. mission to the united nations declined to comment on individual visa cases or the russian and chinese briefing.  russia and china have long been critical of u.s. missile defense systems, particularly the deployment of the terminal high altitude area defense (thaad) in south korea amid heightened tensions with north korea over its ballistic missile and nuclear tests.   the russian federation is confident that the unlimited deployment of the u.s. anti missile defense is a serious threat to the global security and can further unleash the arms race and threaten the entire humanity,  emelianov told the briefing.  major general zhou shangping, deputy director general of the operations bureau, the joint staff department of the central military commission, also briefed.   the deployment of the thaad system does little to upgrade the surveillance capability against the dprk (north korea), but significantly enhances the capability to monitor china s strategic depth and russia s far east,  zhou said.  china and russia have repeatedly demanded the united states halt the deployment of thaad in south korea.

" two democratic senators said on wednesday they may hold up the confirmation of president donald trump’s environmental protection agency nominee susan bodine until she explains her advisory role at the agency, which may violate federal law. senators sheldon whitehouse of rhode island and jeff merkley of oregon sent a list of questions to bodine, trump’s pick to head up the epa’s office of enforcement and compliance assistance, about her current role as special counsel to epa administrator scott pruitt while she waits out the confirmation process. whitehouse and merkley said by advising pruitt on enforcement matters before being confirmed by the senate, bodine may be violating the federal vacancies reform act that prohibits nominees from assuming the authorities of the office before being confirmed by congress. “your appointment creates the appearance, and perhaps the effect, of circumventing the senate’s constitutional advice and consent responsibility for the position to which you have been nominated,” the senators wrote.   this means that subjects of epa enforcement actions could potentially challenge the validity of these actions in court if her role in these decisions is deemed “improper,” they said.  pruitt is the only epa appointee to have been confirmed since trump took office in january. bodine is still awaiting a full senate vote after her senate confirmation hearing in july, while four other assistant administrator nominees are set for confirmation hearings on sept. 20. democratic lawmakers have been at odds with pruitt since his narrow margin confirmation in february over his close ties to industry, his doubts about human caused climate change, planned drastic cuts of the epa’s budget and workforce and ethics requirements for political appointees. the senators also asked bodine if she was involved in a recent epa decision to enforce an obama era rule to regulate methane leaks from new oil and gas infrastructure on a “case by case” basis rather than fully enforcing it. republican senator john barrasso of wyoming, chair of the senate environment committee, said bodine should get her full senate vote immediately. “it is a shame that the critical post of the assistant administrator charged with leading enforcement at the epa remains unfilled,” barrasso said through a spokesman.  the epa was not immediately available for comment.

" the u.s. state department’s legal office has reminded employees  not to promote private interests on social media after its online accounts publicized president donald trump’s private florida resort and his daughter ivanka trump’s new book. an article on a state department website in april about mar a lago and a retweet in may about the book were eventually withdrawn, but the new guidance issued on tuesday said employees should “exercise caution before using a department social media account to highlight non official activities of u.s. government officials and their family.” the guidance was posted on an internal website and written by the office of ethics and financial disclosure of the state department’s office of the legal adviser. a state department official declined to comment on internal communications but said the legal adviser’s office routinely provides guidance to employees on ethics matters. the guidance was directed to social media managers who oversee hundreds of official government accounts on facebook, twitter, and other platforms used by state department agencies, consulates and embassies to communicate information and u.s. foreign policy. the guidance, which was seen by reuters, never specifically mentions trump or his family. but its content appeared to be at least in part in response to the postings on the resort and the book. “if a government official has a commercial enterprise or has published a book, u.s. government resources should not be used to publicize those ventures,” the guidance said.  the posting on trump’s resort was shared on the websites and social media accounts of several u.s. embassies. ethics experts said the piece represented use of public office for private gain. the state department said the article had been meant to inform the public about where trump had been hosting world leaders. a twitter account for the state department’s office of global women’s issues retweeted a post by ivanka trump in which she promoted her new book. ivanka trump serves in the white house as an adviser to her father. trump maintains ownership of his global business empire, though he has handed control to his two oldest sons, an arrangement that ethics watchdogs say does not prevent conflicts of interest.

" a coalition of nearly 20 environmental and native american tribal groups sued the trump administration on tuesday, challenging its delay of a rule limiting emissions of the powerful greenhouse gas methane from oil and gas drilling operations on federal lands. earlier this month, the bureau of land management, part of the department of the interior, suspended implementation of the rule for a year, until jan. 17, 2019, saying it wanted to avoid compliance costs for energy companies as it revises the regulation. the delay “is yet another action taken by the trump administration to benefit the oil and gas industry at the expense of the american public, particularly the millions of westerners” who use public lands for ranching, hunting, hiking and other purposes, darin schroeder, a lawyer with the clean air task force, said in a statement. his organization represented the national wildlife federation, one of the groups that filed the lawsuit against interior secretary ryan zinke and his department. energy companies say the rule, finalized at the end of the obama administration in 2016, could cost them tens of thousands of dollars per well.  the trump administration is expected to announce a new draft rule in coming weeks, in line with its policy of maximizing output of oil, gas and coal and dismantling regulations it says prevent job growth.  the rule targets accidental leaks and intentional venting of methane from drilling operations on public lands, where about 9 percent of the country’s natural gas and 5 percent of its oil were produced last fiscal year. some of its 2017 provisions have already been phased in, but the majority of them have yet to go into effect. the lawsuit, also filed by the sierra club, the environmental defense council, and the diné citizens against ruining our environment, a navajo group, seeks to stop the delay and force the interior department to implement the rule in january. it was filed in the u.s. district court for the northern district of california in san francisco.  the interior department did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the lawsuit.

" bourbon flowed, a jazz band played, and pink and violet lights bathed the vaulted stone ceilings at a party thrown by a liquor producers’ lobby group on monday for attendees of the republican national convention. seven blocks away in cleveland, in the arena where donald trump was to officially accept his party’s nod for the white house, a fight boiled over between trump supporters and foes about the rules concerning his nomination. delegates shouted at each other. the chairman tasked with keeping order briefly abandoned the podium. microphones went dead. typically, the republican convention that takes place every four years is a tale of two conventions. at the official one, activists from all 50 states come to hear testimonials about their party’s presidential nominee and watch the candidate’s official coronation. at the other, republicans in the professional class   strategists, lobbyists, pollsters, lawmakers   rub elbows at cocktail hours and concerts, woo donors at power breakfasts and toss back booze at night, all the while conducting informal business, swapping pledges of support and plans for the future. this year, the disconnect between the two conventions seemed more pronounced, several lobbyists and activists said, and some parties were more subdued. the distilled spirits council’s soiree, normally a jam packed affair, drew a more modest crowd this year, according to some republicans who have attended it at past conventions. the council’s senior vice president, frank coleman, pooh poohed the idea that attendance was down. “it was a very large venue,” he said, saying that the party still attracted about 700 people over the course of the evening. republican strategist ron bonjean said there was a muted tone at some cleveland gatherings, which he attributed to the unique relationship between trump and his party’s establishment. mitt romney, the 2012 republican presidential candidate and a former massachusetts governor, and senator john mccain, the party’s 2008 nominee, hailed from the establishment and had extensive ties with businesspeople and strategists who are convention regulars. by contrast, trump, a real estate developer and former reality tv star who has never held elective office, clinched the republican nomination by touting his outsider status.  “you have a non politician, a hollywood entertainer trying to show americans he’s fit for office, and you have republicans who are used to coming to these things for years,” bonjean said. the two groups, he said, weren’t mixing so smoothly. inside the convention arena on thursday evening, trump fans cheered, danced to a band and roared support for a succession of speakers as they awaited the event’s finale   trump’s speech formally accepting the nomination. but in bars and parties nearby, there was hardly any clapping and cheering as those same scenes flashed across televisions. some republicans flew in to cleveland for only for a day or two, to host events for lawmakers and clients, then left before trump’s thursday night speech. one lobbyist for a large industrial conglomerate, who spoke on condition of anonymity, had a mission in cleveland that had little to do with trump: mingling with congressional republicans and showing support for their re election efforts. the informal convention did still take place, although more subdued. one strategist skipped a night of speeches and pageantry to gamble at a nearby casino. he won $8,000. a group of three made quick glances at a tv screen as trump’s wife, melania, spoke on monday night, checking on her progress between turns at a bar with bowling lanes that had been converted to a private lounge. but there were constant reminders that cleveland was different. as an outsider, trump lacks the kind of donor network that is typical of major party candidates and only recently has begun to ramp up his fundraising. before the convention started, companies that habitually donate to the rnc withheld pledges or withdrew them, leading organizers to ask casino mogul sheldon adelson, a generous party benefactor, for an urgent donation. a strategist who asked for help to raise a last minute $15,000 to sponsor food and drinks at a country music concert for delegates could not find any corporate donors willing to pony up. eight of the 12 people he contacted said they were skipping the convention entirely. on tuesday, trump passed up a chance to forge closer ties with more big donors when he failed to appear at a breakfast  held on the field of the new football stadium in town, according to a report in time magazine. later that day, new jersey governor chris christie met with donors to brief them on plans for a team that would ease trump into office if he wins the nov. 8 election against democrat hillary clinton. such gatherings often attract billionaires and other moneyed luminaries. a man in charge of fundraising surveyed attendees in the modestly sized conference room and declared, “i think i see about $600,000 in here.” ",0
" china has launched more rigorous investigations into the activities and finances of rights lawyers and law firms that take on politically sensitive issues, human rights watch said on tuesday, in its multi year campaign to stifle dissent. china has arrested, jailed or detained thousands of rights lawyers and activists since president xi jinping launched a sweeping crackdown in the summer of 2015. judicial officials and police are investigating the cases and finances at seven law firms that often work on rights abuses, lawyers at the firms told the new york based human rights watch. with unusually high level officials performing scrutiny on site for days, the duration of investigations has exceeded that of previous regular checks on such firms, it added.   while china s human rights lawyers are no strangers to official harassment, these sudden, invasive probes send an alarming message,  sophie richardson, the group s washington based china director, said in a statement. china s justice ministry did not immediately respond to a faxed request for comment from reuters. china has defended the new measures against critics by saying it is a country with the rule of law, and that those found guilty are criminals who damaged social stability and endangered national security.  there has been an open attack on rights lawyers under xi, and the probes should be considered in the context of the attack,  said maya wang, a china researcher for hrw based in hong kong.  it is meant to tell lawyers that this is not over, that they had better be on their best behavior for the 19th party congress,  wang said, referring to a five yearly leadership reshuffle of the ruling communist party set to begin on oct. 18. political checks and requirements for law firms have also been tightened under xi, making it harder for lawyers to take sensitive cases, activists say, especially as law firms can be held jointly accountable for individual violations. chinese law firms are required to explicitly support the party and to set up an internal party branch, while lawyers are banned from expressing opinions that endanger national security or reject china s political system. in the run up to the party congress, xi has also urged public security officials to ensure stability and maintain the party s authority and unified leadership.

" saudi arabia has pledged $100 million to a new regional military force battling jihadist groups in west africa s sahel region, force member mali said on monday.  the contribution would be a major boost to the cash strapped force and bring pledged commitments to more than half the roughly $500 million the g5 sahel says it needs for its first year of operations.   the g5 sahel   composed of the armies of mali, mauritania, niger, burkina faso and chad   launched its first military campaign in october amid growing unrest in the sahel, whose porous borders are regularly crossed by jihadists, including affiliates of al qaeda and islamic state. those groups have stepped up attacks on civilian and military targets, including tourist attractions in regional capitals, raising fears the zone will become a new breeding ground for militants.   mali s foreign ministry said saudi arabian authorities made the pledge during a visit to the kingdom late last month by malian foreign minister abdoulaye diop.  saudi arabia s foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment. the sunni muslim kingdom is competing with its main rival, shi ite power iran, for influence across west africa and other parts of the muslim world. donors from both countries have given money to mosques and other causes there. france, the g5 s most vocal foreign backer, has pressed saudi arabia to take concrete actions to fight islamist militants. french president emmanuel macron asked saudi crown prince mohammed bin salman to contribute to the g5 when he saw him in riyadh last month.  the european union, france, the united states and each of the g5 countries have also promised to fund the force.

" president donald trump told u.s. lawmakers on tuesday he wants bipartisan cooperation on tax reform, as pressure on him to produce a legislative victory on any front escalated with the collapse of the latest republican push to repeal obamacare. the administration and republicans in congress are due to unveil a tax plan on wednesday. the plan has been developed over several months by six white house and congressional republicans working behind closed doors and with no input from democrats. on the eve of its unveiling, trump told members of the house of representatives tax committee from both parties: “i’ve asked lawmakers of both parties to join us to discuss our framework. ... it’s time for both parties to come together.” he said lawmakers should expect a “very, very powerful document” that would deliver a big tax cut for the middle class. “we will cut taxes tremendously for the middle class   not just a little bit, but tremendously,” said the president, who is set to travel to indianapolis on wednesday to unveil the plan. republicans, who control the white house and both chambers of congress have been unable to deliver a significant legislative win on any topic since trump took office in january. senate republicans admitted failure on tuesday in their latest push to replace the 2010 affordable care act, popularly known as obamacare,, raising pressure on the party to overhaul the tax code this year, although that difficult effort has repeatedly been delayed. republicans and democrats who met with trump on tuesday said afterward that the president indicated an interest in working with democrats on both tax reform and healthcare going forward. “he said you get a better deal if it’s bipartisan,” said representative richard neal, the panel’s top democrat. senate finance committee chairman orrin hatch has also called for bipartisan tax reform. details of the trump tax plan that have leaked out showed that the corporate income tax rate would be slashed to 20 percent from 35 percent, the rate for “pass through” businesses to 25 percent from 39.6 percent, and the rate for top individual earners to 35 percent from 39.6 percent the u.s. tax code has not been overhauled since 1986 under republican president ronald reagan. in the years since, it has gotten much more complex, skewed toward special interests and insufficient for raising enough revenue to cover washington’s spending, producing a federal budget deficit. as the trump administration and congressional republicans have tried in recent months to forge a tax plan, their work has focused mostly on cutting tax rates and less on attempting a comprehensive overhaul of the code.   the trump plan is expected to be light on specifics, particularly on how to pay for its proposed tax cuts, although neal said the white house pushed hard on the idea of eliminating the deduction for state and local tax payments. lawmakers said some key tax rates were still in flux on tuesday.  without offsets such as the closing of lucrative tax loopholes to pay for lower tax rates, the proposed tax cuts would deeply cut federal revenue by about $5 trillion in a decade, according to the nonpartisan tax foundation think tank. such huge revenue losses, as well as the plan’s anticipated inclusion of a tax cut for the wealthiest americans, could make cooperation difficult for democrats, who want tax reform to be revenue neutral and to offer no relief for top earners. neal said trump showed a readiness to avoid cutting taxes for the wealthy during their meeting. “he said, quote, the rich will not benefit,” said the massachusetts democrat. representative james renacci, a ways and means committee republican, said individual tax rates were still under discussion, including the possibility of raising the tax rate for the poorest taxpayers to 12 percent from 10 percent.  “there are a lot of questions on where we’re at in that area at this point. some things are not totally tied down,” renacci told reuters. “we’ve got some tweaking to do.” among republicans, even fiscal hawks were showing a willingness to accept huge revenue losses, predicting that aggressive tax cuts would drive future economic growth and produce new tax revenues that would pay for lower rates. such economic assumptions have been questioned by democrats, who say that the trump tax plan will unfairly favor the wealthy and that providing them with tax cuts does not drive growth.  senate republicans tentatively agreed last week that tax legislation could lose up to $1.5 trillion over a decade, but become revenue neutral thereafter due to economic growth. on tuesday, mark meadows, chairman of the conservative house freedom caucus, said he would not support a tax reform plan with a corporate tax rate above 20 percent or a small business tax rate above 25 percent.

" none of the german parties involved in exploratory coalition talks support french president emmanuel macron s idea to create a separate budget for the euro zone, a negotiator for the greens party told reuters on wednesday. reinhard buetikofer, who participated in a late night negotiating session on european policy on tuesday with german chancellor angela merkel s conservatives and the free democrats (fdp), said the greens supported the idea of more investment in infrastructure but not a new budget.  none of the participating parties support a euro zone budget,  buetikofer, a member of the european parliament said.  we greens fully support the idea of finding ways, within the framework of the existing eu budget, to boost investment in infrastructure. we share macron s aim of increasing investment.  the news is a blow to macron, who has called for the creation of a euro zone budget of several hundred billions of euros to help the single currency bloc cope with economic shocks. the greens are seen as the biggest supporters of macron s ideas among the german parties considering a coalition.

" the united nations security council is considering a draft resolution that would insist any decisions on the status of jerusalem have no legal effect and must be rescinded after u.s. president donald trump recognized the city as israel s capital.  the one page egyptian drafted text, which was circulated to the 15 member council on saturday and seen by reuters, does not specifically mention the united states or trump. diplomats say it has broad support but will likely be vetoed by washington. the council could vote early next week, diplomats said. a resolution needs nine votes in favor and no vetoes by the united states, france, britain, russia or china to pass. trump abruptly reversed decades of u.s. policy this month when he recognized jerusalem as israel s capital, generating outrage from palestinians. trump also plans to move the u.s. embassy to jerusalem from tel aviv. after the decision, arab foreign ministers agreed to seek a u.n. security council resolution. while the draft is unlikely to be adopted, it would further isolate trump over the jerusalem issue.  the u.s. mission to the united nations declined to comment on the draft. u.s. ambassador to the united nations nikki haley has praised trump s decision as  the just and right thing to do.  the draft u.n. resolution  affirms that any decisions and actions which purport to have altered, the character, status or demographic composition of the holy city of jerusalem have no legal effect, are null and void and must be rescinded in compliance with relevant resolutions of the security council.  it calls upon all countries to refrain establishing diplomatic missions in jerusalem. israel considers the city its eternal and indivisible capital and wants all embassies based there.   no vote or debate will change the clear reality that jerusalem  is the capital of israel, israel s ambassador to the united nations, danny danon, said in a statement.  palestinians want the capital of an independent palestinian state to be in the city s eastern sector, which israel captured in a 1967 war and annexed in a move never recognized internationally.     the draft council resolution  demands that all states comply with security council resolutions regarding the holy city of jerusalem, and not to recognize any actions or measures contrary to those resolutions.  a u.n. security council resolution adopted in december last year  underlines that it will not recognize any changes to the 4 june 1967 lines, including with regard to jerusalem, other than those agreed by the parties through negotiations.  that resolution was approved with 14 votes in favor and an abstention by former u.s. president barack obama s administration.

" north korea has sent a letter to australia s parliament, warning it is a nuclear power and will not be cowed by u.s. president donald trump s threats to destroy it, according to a copy of the letter published in an australian newspaper on friday.  if trump thinks that he would bring the dprk, a nuclear power, to its knees through nuclear war threat, it will be a big miscalculation and an expression of ignorance,  said a facsimile of the letter, published by the sydney morning herald and verified by australia s foreign ministry.  trump threatened to totally destroy the dprk ... it is an extreme act of threatening to totally destroy the whole world.  a spokeswoman for australia s foreign minister told reuters the herald report was accurate and the paper s copy of the letter, dated sept. 28, was genuine. titled  open letter to parliaments of different countries,  the note said it was sent from north korea s embassy in jakarta, indonesia, to australia s embassy in the same city, as well as to other countries, without naming them. dprk stands for the democratic people s republic of korea, north korea s official name. tension has soared on the peninsula following a series of weapons tests by north korea and a string of increasingly bellicose exchanges between trump and north korean leader kim jong un. trump, in a speech last month at the united nations, threatened to  totally destroy  north korea if necessary to defend itself and allies and called the north s leader kim jong un a  rocket man  on a suicide mission. the letter calls for  countries loving independence, peace and justice  to discharge their duty and keep  sharp vigilance against the heinous and reckless moves of the trump administration trying to drive the world into a horrible nuclear disaster.  at a press conference in sydney, australian foreign minister julie bishop said the note was an  unprecedented  communication.  it is not the way they usually publish their global messages. the collective strategy of imposing maximum diplomatic and economic pressure through sanctions on north korea is working. this is a response to the pressure.

" voters and civil rights groups reported long lines, isolated cases of malfunctioning equipment and some harassment at polling places in tuesday’s u.s. presidential election but fears of widespread violence at the polls did not materialize. nationwide, civil rights groups logged unusual levels of voter intimidation complaints, receiving about 35,000 calls through a national voter complaint hotline as of tuesday evening. democratic party officials, however, said they did not see systemic voter suppression efforts. civil rights groups, who have enlisted 7,000 volunteers, said 40 percent of the calls they had received through the telephone hotline by early afternoon were from african american and latino voters. complaints of voter intimidation were especially prevalent in florida, georgia, ohio and arizona with a disproportionate share coming from minority voters. “we are hearing more complaints about voter intimidation than we have in presidential cycles from prior years,” said kristen clarke, president of the lawyers’ committee for civil rights under law. republican presidential candidate donald trump has repeatedly said the election would be “rigged” and called on his supporters to watch for signs of fraud in urban areas, raising fears they could clash with minority voters. numerous studies have found that voter fraud is exceedingly rare in the united states. absent on tuesday were reports of the kind of hostile political displays, vandalism and violence that have cropped up regularly throughout the campaign. a polling station was locked down in southern california after one person was killed and three wounded by gunfire but police saw no immediate indication the incident was linked to election day. but isolated reports of voter intimidation and harassment flooded the voter complaint hotline run by a coalition of civil rights groups throughout the day. an african american voter called the hotline from alabama’s shelby county to report that a white poll worker had indicated she would have to wash her hands after handling the voter’s photo identification card.  shelby county lawyers persuaded the u.s. supreme court in 2013 to strike down a key provision of the landmark voting rights act requiring states with a history of voter discrimination to get federal clearance for changes to their election laws. clarke said many voter complaints to the hotline came from states formerly covered by that provision. some voters in florida reported a heavy, unexplained police presence at several polling sites around the state. a group of students in the state were told their votes would not count because their college dormitory was considered a hotel.  in ohio’s franklin county, the hotline received complaints that somali american voters were told they would have to vote provisionally because their addresses did not match their identification cards   and then were told that the polling site had run out of provisional ballots. in georgia’s dekalb county, a group calling itself defenders of democracy was pressuring voters in line to fill out sample ballots and sign pledges that they would cast the same votes on the real ballot, according to reports received by the hotline. the federal government reduced its election monitoring program in the wake of a 2013 u.s. supreme court decision that weakened federal oversight of states with a history of racial discrimination. revised voting laws and lengthy court battles in many states also have left voters uncertain about when and where they can cast their ballot and whether they will need to present photo identification.  a nevada judge on tuesday rejected a request from trump for records from a las vegas polling place that his campaign said had improperly remained open last week to accommodate people who were lined up to vote. the judge agreed with a county attorney who argued that election officials already preserve records.  malfunctioning machines dominated voter complaints out of pennsylvania, arizona, new york, north carolina and virginia. trump cited reports that polling machines were switching votes for republican candidates to votes for democrats as cause for concern that the election outcome might not be valid, once again warning of a rigged system. speaking to fox news, trump provided no evidence to support the allegations or say where polling machines were breaking down, although there were some problems in pennsylvania. voters in at least four pennsylvania counties said touch screen voting machines were mistakenly switching votes. state officials, however, said they did not believe any ballots had been wrongly counted as a result of the machine malfunctions. pennsylvania is one of a handful of states that relies on electronic voting machines without a paper backup that would allow officials to double check the outcome if it is challenged. the machines can record votes incorrectly if they are not calibrated properly, a problem that is magnified as the screens degrade with age.  but es&s, the company that makes the machines, said voters have a chance to confirm their choices before they cast their ballot, making it impossible for the machine to flip a vote from one candidate to another. local officials test machines to make sure they are calibrated properly before each election. the philadelphia district attorney’s office, which monitors voting in the state’s largest city, said on twitter it was not receiving any complaints out of the ordinary. electronic voting rolls in durham county, north carolina, malfunctioned early on tuesday, prompting the county to ask the state board of elections to extend voting hours in eight precincts until 9 p.m., an hour and a half later than they were supposed to be open. the state elections board on tuesday evening agreed to extend voting hours in the precincts by between 20 and 60 minutes.

" tearful family members paid tribute to canadian pharmaceutical billionaires and philanthropists barry and honey sherman before thousands of people on thursday, less than a week after news of the couple s mysterious deaths shocked the nation. the shermans were found hanging by belts around their necks from a railing beside a pool in the basement of their toronto mansion, a friend of the family told reuters.  canadian prime minister justin trudeau attended the memorial service in toronto, as did hundreds of apotex inc employees wearing blue, the official color of barry sherman s company.  the sherman s son jonathon began an emotional eulogy by saying the family was frustrated with the way toronto police have handled the case, referencing canadian media reports that said investigators were working on the theory that barry sherman, 75, had killed his 70 year old wife and then himself.  we ve had to navigate through a terrifying maze of non information and unfounded speculation,  jonathon sherman said.  i kept expecting my parents to walk through the front door and say,  everything will be fine. we ve taken control of the situation.  police have confirmed that the shermans died of ligature strangulation and that there were no signs of forced entry to the couple s home.  homicide detectives are leading the investigation, but the deaths have not been declared a homicide. police have not detained any suspects and have not said if they are looking for any. family, friends, colleagues and political leaders remembered barry sherman as a brilliant man. they described the graduate of the prestigious massachusetts institute of technology as an accomplished executive who worked around the clock to build apotex into one of the world s biggest generic drugmakers.  several speakers mentioned his penchant for chiding people over grammatical mistakes.   he pretty well thought he was smarter than anyone else,  said jack kaye, an apotex executive who worked alongside sherman for decades.  and he wasn t wrong about that.  honey sherman was described as vivacious and dedicated, a philanthropist who worked hard to keep her extended family close.   she was my best friend and my other half,  said her sister mary schechtman.  we completed each other s sentences and never went anywhere without each other.

" u.s. food and drug administration commissioner scott gottlieb, considered a potential successor to recently departed health and human services secretary tom price, said on tuesday he believed he could best serve the trump administration in his current role.     “i feel like i want to continue to follow through on the policies we’ve put out and it’s where i think i can be most effective,” gottlieb told reuters in an interview in new york. he declined to say whether he had been approached about the job by the white house. “i’m not going to get into private discussions i might have had around that,” he said. gottlieb is one of several potential candidates for the top job at hhs, a post vacated by price last month following an uproar over his use of private jets for government business. other names mentioned by health policy experts include seema verma, administrator of the centers for medicare & medicaid services (cms) and louisiana governor bobby jindal. gottlieb has won mostly positive reviews since taking over as fda commissioner in may. he has introduced policies tackling some of the country’s biggest health challenges, including opioid and tobacco addiction and rising prescription drug prices.  the top post at the fda has always been difficult to fill, gottlieb noted, and there have been long stretches where the agency has operated under an acting commissioner. gottlieb once served as senior adviser to fda commissioner mark mcclellan, who left the agency in 2004 after just two years to run cms, a move that gottlieb said was detrimental to the agency. “it’s always challenging to move an fda commissioner,” he said. “continuity of leadership there is important.” in a wide ranging interview, gottlieb said the situation on the ground in puerto rico, where 10 percent of drugs prescribed in the united states are made, was “very bad” and that shortages of some drugs could emerge within as little as two to three weeks. he also said the agency is going to more clearly define regulations around cell therapies. the law currently states that if a cell is extracted from a patient’s body and more than minimally manipulated it is a drug subject to fda regulation. “historically the fda hasn’t vigorously enforced around that line because it didn’t have the implementing guidelines to do that,” he said. at the same time, the agency plans novel measures to make it easier for small academic centers to apply for fda product approval by pooling data generated from similar work. “if academicians working at different academic sites are doing a similar procedure with stem cells, if they are all following the same protocol, then they’re going to be able to pool their data to submit it for regulatory approval,” he said.

" u.s. cruise operators and airlines stand to lose around $712 million in annual revenues if the trump administration fully reinstates restrictions on travel to cuba, washington lobby group engage cuba said in a report released on thursday. u.s. operated cruises and scheduled flights to the caribbean island were relaunched last year after a half century hiatus, as part of the detente with cuba pursued by former president barack obama. that may be under threat as u.s. president donald trump’s administration nears completion of a policy review to determine how far it would reverse that engagement. “rolling back expanded travel will cost airlines $512 million annually ... based on the average ticket fare,” engage cuba wrote in the report to which a host of cuba experts contributed. u.s. airlines flying to cuba include jetblue, american, delta and alaska. cruise operators, from carnival to norwegian [nclh.o], stand to lose $200 million in revenue per year, engage cuba estimated, noting that thousands of jobs in both sectors were at risk. the estimate was based on lost revenue from fully booked flights and cruises. eliminating cruises to cuba could also cost south florida’s economy an additional $212.8 million, given what passengers spend in port communities, cuba engage said. supporters of the u.s. cuban detente are stepping up their lobbying to influence the trump administration review. a bipartisan group of u.s. senators last week reintroduced legislation to repeal all restrictions on travel to cuba, this time attracting far more co sponsors. u.s. tourism to cuba is still not allowed, but obama’s decision to ease travel restrictions fueled a boom in american visitors under categories like educational travel. the number of u.s. visitors rose 74 percent last year.

" nato allies on friday publicly raised concern about a russian cruise missile system that the alliance says may break a cold war era pact banning such weapons, in a show of support for washington. the united states believes russia is developing a ground launched cruise missile system with a range that is prohibited by a 1987 treaty, which could give russia the ability to launch a nuclear strike on europe on short notice.   allies have identified a russian missile system that raises serious concerns,  the north atlantic treaty organisation said in a statement.  nato urges russia to address these concerns in a substantial and transparent way, and actively engage in a technical dialogue with the united states.  in a separate statement, the u.s. envoy to nato, kay bailey hutchison, said:  russia s behavior raises serious concerns.  russia has denied it is violating the 1987 intermediate range nuclear forces treaty. u.s. led nato s concerns are likely to further strain relations between moscow and the west that are already at a low over russia s 2014 seizure of crimea, western sanctions on the russian economy and u.s. accusations that moscow used computer hackers to influence the 2016 u.s. presidential election. moscow denies that it interfered in the election. the nato statement follows a meeting between russia and the united states in geneva this week to mark the 30th anniversary of the treaty between the united states and the soviet union. according to an april u.s. state department report, washington determined in 2016 that russia was in violation of its treaty obligations  not to possess, produce, or flight test  a ground launched cruise missile with a range capability of 500 km to 5,500 km (310 3,417 miles),  or to possess or produce launchers of such missiles.   last week, the state department said it is reviewing military options, including new intermediate range cruise missile systems, the first response by u.s. president donald trump s administration to the u.s. charges. the russian foreign ministry said last week it was ready for talks with the united states to try to preserve the treaty and would comply with its obligations if the united states did. in a statement marking the 30th anniversary of the imf treaty last week, the russian foreign ministry said moscow considered  the language of ultimatums  and sanctions unacceptable.

" a federal judge in hawaii indefinitely extended on wednesday an order blocking enforcement of president donald trump’s revised  ban on travel to the united states from six predominantly muslim countries. u.s. district judge derrick watson turned an earlier temporary restraining order into a preliminary injunction in a lawsuit brought by the state of hawaii challenging trump’s travel directive as unconstitutional religious discrimination.  trump signed the new ban on march 6 in a bid to overcome legal problems with a january executive order that caused chaos at airports and sparked mass protests before a washington judge stopped its enforcement in february. trump has said the travel ban is needed for national security. in its challenge to the travel ban, hawaii claims its state universities would be harmed by the order because they would have trouble recruiting students and faculty. it also says the island state’s economy would be hit by a decline in tourism. the court papers cite reports that travel to the united states “took a nosedive” after trump’s actions. the state was joined by a new plaintiff named ismail elshikh, an american citizen from egypt who is an imam at the muslim association of hawaii and whose mother in law lives in syria, according to the lawsuit. hawaii and other opponents of the ban claim that the motivation behind it is based on religion and trump’s election campaign promise of “a total and complete shutdown of muslims entering the united states.” “the court will not crawl into a corner, pull the shutters closed, and pretend it has not seen what it has,” watson wrote on wednesday. watson wrote that his decision to grant the preliminary injunction was based on the likelihood that the state would succeed in proving that the travel ban violated the u.s. constitution’s religious freedom protection. trump has vowed to take the case to the u.s. supreme court, which is currently split 4 4 between liberals and conservatives with the president’s pick   appeals court judge neil gorsuch   still awaiting confirmation.

"u.s.-led coalition air strikes killed dozens of syrian soldiers on saturday, endangering a u.s.-russian ceasefire and prompting an emergency u.n. security council meeting as tensions between moscow and washington escalated.just a few days ago it was reported that putin felt that if anything happened to damage the tentative ceasefire agreement that it would be obama s fault. seems he was right.reuters reported:the united states military said the coalition stopped the attacks against what it had believed to be islamic state positions in northeast syria after russia informed it that syrian military personnel and vehicles may have been hit.  the united states relayed its  regret  through the russian government for what it described as the unintentional loss of life of syrian forces in the strike, a senior obama administration official said in an emailed statement.  pentagon press secretary peter cook said in an emailed statement that russian officials did not voice concerns earlier on saturday when informed that coalition aircraft would be operating in the strike area.  the 15-member security council met on saturday night after russia demanded an emergency session to discuss the incident and accused the united states of jeopardizing the syria deal.  the u.s. ambassador to the united nations, samantha power, chastised russia for the move. russia really needs to stop the cheap point scoring and the grandstanding and the stunts and focus on what matters, which is implementation of something we negotiated in good faith with them,  power told reporters. she said the united states was investigating the air strikes and  if we determine that we did indeed strike syrian military personnel, that was not our intention and we of course regret the loss of life.  when asked if the incident spelled the end of the syria deal between moscow and washington, russia s u.n. ambassador vitaly churkin said:  this is a very big question mark.   i would be very interested to see how washington is going to react. if what ambassador power has done today is any indication of their possible reaction then we are in serious trouble,  churkin told reporters. moscow cited the strikes, which allowed islamic state fighters to briefly overrun a syrian army position near deir al-zor airport, as evidence that the united states was helping the jihadist militants.   we are reaching a really terrifying conclusion for the whole world: that the white house is defending islamic state. now there can be no doubts about that,  the ria novosti news agency quoted russian foreign ministry spokeswoman maria zakharova as saying.  power said zakharova should be embarrassed by that claim. churkin said russia had no  specific evidence  of the united states colluding with islamic state militants. the syrian conflict has been a tug-o-war between washington and moscow for some time now. both putin an obama have pulled maneuvers that could have been detrimental to all involved, but this latest air-strike was such an obvious and epic failure that obama can t hide from. we have all felt that he supports the islamic state terror group and if this  accident  doesn t show that then nothing will. lets hope an pray that the ramifications aren t too harsh.the discussions are still being maintained in a diplomatic way thankfully and they haven t reached a level of action by russia against the u.s. as of yet.h/t [ reuters ] ",1

" president donald trump told congress on tuesday he was open to immigration reform, shifting from his harsh rhetoric on illegal immigration in a speech that offered a more restrained tone than his election campaign and first month in the white house. trump, in a prime time address to a country that remains divided over his leadership, set aside disputes with democrats and the news media to deliver his most presidential performance to date, seeking to regain the confidence of americans rattled by his leadership thus far. the president’s speech was long on promises but short on specifics on how to achieve a challenging legislative agenda that could add dramatically to budget deficits. he wants a healthcare overhaul, broad tax cuts and a $1 trillion public private initiative to rebuild degraded roads and bridges. trump built a base of support behind his presidential campaign by vowing to fight illegal immigration. in his speech, he took a more moderate tone, appealing to republicans and democrats to work together on immigration reform. he said it was possible if both republicans and democrats in congress were willing to compromise, although he also said u.s. immigration should be based on a merit based system, rather than relying on lower skilled immigrants. comprehensive immigration reform eluded his two predecessors, democrat barack obama and republican george w. bush, because of deep divisions within congress and among americans over the issue. trump said reform would raise wages and help more struggling families enter the middle class. “i believe that real and positive immigration reform is possible, as long as we focus on the following goals: to improve jobs and wages for americans, to strengthen our nation’s security, and to restore respect for our laws,” said the republican president. trump’s first month in office was dominated by a fight over his temporary travel ban on people from seven muslim majority nations, repeated attacks on the news media and harsh personal criticism of judges who blocked his immigration order. in his speech on tuesday, he appeared to look for a reset, trying to move past a chaotic period that sowed doubts about his ability to govern effectively. “the time for trivial fights is behind us,” he said. financial markets showed a muted reaction as trump gave few specifics or new details. early signs showed trump’s speech drew a positive response. a cnn/orc poll found 57 percent of viewers thought trump’s speech was very positive and 69 percent said they felt more optimistic about the future of the country. “he’s lost his foot and mouth disease,” said tom beckwith, 71, of seminole, florida. “this was a tremendous speech. he’s cured.” still, there was plenty of evidence of ongoing partisan divisions. in the chamber of the house of representatives where trump spoke, democrats sometimes sat in silence and turned their thumbs down at his remarks. many women lawmakers wore white in a subtle show of protest. democratic senator christopher coons of delaware called trump’s speech one of “the most coherent public addresses he’s given in a month.” but coons said he viewed trump’s forthcoming budget proposals as “gravely concerning,” citing the president’s plan for paying for a defense buildup by cutting foreign aid and other programs. much of trump’s speech focused on solving problems at home in line with his “america first” rhetoric. apart from criticizing obama for increasing the national debt, trump did not mention the federal budget deficit, which will severely limit any new spending programs. on immigration, trump again pledged to build a wall on the u.s. mexico border, but he made no mention this time of mexico paying for it. he also said he would “shortly take new steps to keep our nation safe,” referring to a new executive order he is to sign to replace one embroiled in the courts. trump focused part of the speech on foreign policy, stressing his support for nato but insisting allies pay more for their defense. in a possible nod to his bid to warm relations with russia, which he did not mention by name, trump said: “america is willing to find new friends, and to forge new partnerships, where shared interests align.” trump has been criticized for his praise of russian president vladimir putin. a u.s. congressional committee is investigating contacts between trump’s election campaign and russia to see if there were any inappropriate communications. “we want harmony and stability, not war and conflict,” said trump, who said, however, he would embark on a big defense buildup. trump said he wanted to provide “massive tax relief” to the middle class and cut corporate tax rates. but he did not offer specifics and failed to comment on the most pressing tax issue facing congress, a proposed border adjustment tax to boost exports over imports. lawmakers have been looking to trump for more leadership on an issue that has divided corporate america and republicans in congress. trump called on the republican led congress to repeal and replace obamacare with reforms that expand choice, increase access and lower costs.  republicans remain divided on how to accomplish that goal and democrats vehemently oppose tampering with a system that provides health insurance for millions of low income americans. while trump’s comments lacked detail, it was the first time he publicly supported tax credits to help americans purchase their own coverage, a nod to health insurers who say they are necessary to keep people in the market. former kentucky governor steve beshear said in the democratic response to trump’s speech that “you and your republican allies in congress seem determined to rip affordable health insurance away from millions of americans who most need it.” in the most emotional moment of the night, trump singled out carryn owens, the widow of u.s navy seal william “ryan” owens, who was killed in a raid on al qaeda in yemen.  owens, tears streaming down her face, clasped her hands and looked upward from her spot in the balcony as lawmakers and the president applauded her in the longest ovation of trump’s hour long speech.  trump said the mission that her husband participated in obtained vital intelligence that could be used against islamist militants, taking issue with news reports quoting u.s. officials who said little was gained from the raid.

" the world health organization (who) on friday urged u.s. president elect donald trump to expand obamacare and ensure all americans have access to healthcare. the real estate magnate takes office next month after promising to repeal outgoing president barack obama’s signature healthcare policy which helped millions more americans get medical insurance but has been a target of republican attacks. agnes soucat, the who’s director of health system governance and financing, said there were various ways of providing health cover to more people, and it amounted to “political choices.” “we as the who really encourage the new administration to make sure that the social contract is expanded and that all u.s. citizens have access to health care,” soucat told a news briefing in geneva. the united states is the only country among the 35 member states of the organisation for economic cooperation and development (oecd) not to provide universal health care, a key  u.n. sustainable development goal for 2030, she said. the affordable care act, known commonly as obamacare, has provided some 25 million previously uninsured americans with health cover. republicans say it has created unwarranted government intervention in personal healthcare and private industry. trump in late november picked republican u.s. representative tom price, an orthopedic surgeon from georgia and obamacare critic, to be his health secretary. price has long championed a plan of tax credits, expanded health savings accounts, and lawsuit reforms to replace obamacare. republicans are divided over how quickly an obamacare repeal should go into effect, with some saying a delay would give them time to work on a replacement, instead of throwing millions of americans out of their health insurance with no substitute. “there are different strategies to make universal health care particularly pro poor,” soucat said. “so what we are saying is, yes, this would be a setback if people would lose coverage.” ",0

" president donald trump has added a veteran washington lawyer to the team representing him in the investigations of possible collusion by the trump campaign with russia, including the criminal probe being led by special counsel robert mueller. john dowd, who has represented key figures in a variety white collar criminal matters and investigations, has joined the president’s defense team led by new york lawyer marc kasowitz, mark corallo, a spokesman for the team, said on friday. another well known white collar washington lawyer will likely join the team shortly, according to a person familiar with the matter. dowd, 76, represented u.s. senator john mccain on congressional ethics charges in the “keating five” banking scandal in the late 1980s and early 1990s. mccain was cleared in the matter. in 1989, dowd’s investigation on behalf of major league baseball led to former hall of famer pete rose being banned from the sport for betting on games while he was manager of the cincinnati reds. dowd also defended galleon group hedge fund founder raj rajaratnam in a 2011 trial brought by federal prosecutors in new york over insider trading. rajaratnam was found guilty and sentenced to 11 years in prison. earlier in his career, dowd served in the u.s. marine corps and was part of a u.s. department of justice organized crime unit. he went into private practice in 1978. he worked for many years at the law firm of akin gump strauss hauer & feld, retiring in 2015. along with kasowitz and dowd, the other lawyers on trump’s team so far are jay sekulow, a conservative activist with a radio call in show, and michael bowe, a longtime partner in kasowitz’s firm.  mueller is investigating possible ties between trump’s campaign and the russian government, which u.s. officials have said meddled in the 2016 election. russia has denied such interference. the white house has denied any collusion with moscow. the special counsel also is looking into whether trump has sought to obstruct the investigation, a person familiar with the inquiry said on thursday. former fbi director james comey testified earlier this month that trump asked him to drop the bureau’s investigation of former national security adviser michael flynn. the senate and house intelligence committees are also investigating possible ties between russia and the trump campaign.

" washington governor jay inslee on tuesday signed a bill that paves the way for the state to create what is believed to be the first system in the united states to certify marijuana as organic. the sponsor of the bill, republican senator ann rivers, said marijuana certified as organically grown is likely to be on sale in washington in about a year and a half. washington is among a handful of u.s. states where voters approved the sale of recreational marijuana. washington was the second state to begin legal recreational pot sales, in mid 2014, after its voters in 2012 approved it. “this is consumer driven,” rivers told reuters by phone on tuesday night. “as we have moved forward in the legal marijuana market, we’re hearing people say, ‘we don’t want any pesticides, fungicides, none of that stuff in our weed.’” the new law “creates a voluntary program for the certification and regulation of organic marijuana products,” to be administered by the washington agriculture department, according to a state analysis of the new law. rivers said the “heavy lifting” in certifying marijuana has been done by the system of doing the same for a multitude of food products on supermarkets shelves across america. that process just needs to be adapted for pot, she said. rivers said that legal recreational marijuana is “the gift that keeps on giving....this year, we’ll make $768 million” in revenue for the state of washington. this pays for drug education and drug addiction treatment as well as public education, she said. organic pot was just one of a myriad of marijuana related measures in the bill. many state legislators wanted to vote for only one marijuana related bill rather than have to go on the record favoring marijuana several times, rivers said. the november 2012 measure to allow recreational marijuana in washington passed 56 percent to 44 percent. while it is legal for adults to smoke marijuana in washington, it is not legal to grow industrial hemp. the new law allows for the study of a method to allow hemp to be grown and used for industrial purposes. last week, vermont’s legislature approved a bill to legalize recreational use of marijuana. unless the measure is vetoed, vermont would be the first state to legalize pot without a public vote. voters have approved legal recreational marijuana use in colorado, washington, alaska, oregon, california, nevada, maine, massachusetts and the district of columbia.

" a u.s. congressional committee on friday asked the trump administration to disclose an estimate of the number of americans whose digital communications are incidentally collected under foreign surveillance programs, according to a letter seen by reuters. such an estimate is “crucial as we contemplate reauthorization,” of parts of the foreign intelligence surveillance act that are due to expire at the end of the year, house judiciary committee chairman bob goodlatte, a republican, and john conyers, the panel’s top democrat, wrote in a letter addressed to director of national intelligence dan coats. the request comes as some republican lawmakers, many of whom have stridently defended u.s. surveillance programs in the past, express sudden interest in considering additional privacy safeguards to how u.s. spy agencies collect and share intelligence that contains information about americans. that interest has been sparked by evolving, unsubstantiated assertions that the obama white house used surveillance powers to improperly spy on the incoming trump administration. privacy advocates have for years demanded that the u.s. government share an estimate of how many americans are ensnared by programs authorized under a certain part of fisa, known as section 702, that allows for the collection of vast quantities of internet communications from foreigners believed to be living overseas.  some experts and lawmakers have said they believe data on  millions of americans could be caught under such surveillance, exposing them to warrantless searches by federal investigators. “it is clear that section 702 surveillance programs can and do collect information about u.s. persons, on subjects unrelated to counter terrorism,” wrote goodlatte and conyers, who requested a response by april 24. “it is imperative that we understand the size of this impact on u.s. persons as our committee proceeds with the debate on reauthorization.” in a separate letter sent last december to the outgoing obama administration, members of the house judiciary committee said they were given assurances by officials that an estimate would be provided, likely by january of this year. richard ledgett, the deputy director of the national security agency, said “yes” when asked by a reuters reporter last month whether an estimate would be provided before year end. he also said about 20 “vignettes” would be publicly released that show the important national security value of section 702, which officials have described as among the most important intelligence tools at their disposal. section 702 will expire on dec. 31, 2017, absent congressional action.

" alabama’s state attorney general will fill the u.s. senate seat vacated by republican jeff sessions after his confirmation as attorney general of the united states, governor robert bentley said on thursday. luther strange, also a republican, will hold the senate seat until a special election in 2018, the governor’s office said in a statement.  sessions, 70, served two decades as a senator for alabama before being confirmed on wednesday as president donald trump’s attorney general. a senate divided by concerns over his record on civil rights voted 52 47, largely along party lines. strange, a 63 year old former basketball player at tulane university nicknamed “big luther” for his size, had announced his plans to run for the seat after trump nominated sessions. “i pledge to the people of alabama to continue the same level of leadership as jeff sessions in consistently fighting to protect and advance the conservative values we all care about,” strange said in a statement following his appointment. alabama voters first elected strange as attorney general in 2010. bentley on thursday highlighted strange’s role in negotiating the landmark settlement agreement with bp for the 2010 deepwater horizon oil spill in the gulf of mexico. according to local media, alabama lawmakers said strange asked them last year to suspend their impeachment investigation of bentley over allegations he had an affair with a former political adviser and used state resources to pursue it. the republican governor has denied the affair and any wrongdoing. lawmakers said strange was conducting a related probe, but the attorney general’s office has not said whether it was investigating the governor, according to the montgomery advertiser newspaper. a spokeswoman for the attorney general’s office did not have an immediate comment on the reports. the governor’s office said bentley conducted more than 20 hours of interviews with candidates before tapping strange for the senate seat. bentley said strange would be sworn in on thursday.

" the nomination to be ambassador to singapore of k.t. mcfarland, a former security adviser to president donald trump, has been delayed due to concerns about her testimony to congress over communications with russia, the chairman of the senate foreign relations committee said on tuesday. “her nomination is frozen for a while until that gets worked out,” republican senator bob corker told reporters at the u.s. capitol. trump earlier this year nominated mcfarland, a former deputy national security adviser, to be the u.s. envoy to singapore.  the foreign relations committee approved the nomination in september despite the opposition of almost every democratic member, but no vote on mcfarland has been scheduled in the full senate. mcfarland said in a written response to a question from democratic senator cory booker, a foreign relations committee member, that she was “not aware” of communications between trump’s former national security adviser, michael flynn and sergei kislyak, when kislyak was ambassador to russia.  however, the new york times reported on monday that it had obtained an email mcfarland sent on dec. 29, 2016, the day former president barack obama’s administration authorized new sanctions against russia, saying flynn would talk to kislyak that evening. flynn pleaded guilty on friday to lying to the federal bureau of investigation about his contacts with russia, and agreed to cooperate with prosecutors delving into the actions of trump’s inner circle before he took office.

" pakistan has rejected u.s. criticism of its efforts to fight terrorism, saying it should not be made a scapegoat for the failure of the u.s. military to win the war in afghanistan. u.s. president donald trump unveiled his policy for afghanistan on monday, stepping up the military campaign against taliban insurgents and singling out pakistan for harboring them. u.s. officials later warned that aid to pakistan might be cut and washington might downgrade nuclear armed pakistan s status as a major non nato ally, in order to pressure it to do more to help bring about an end to america s longest running war. pakistan s powerful military chief, general qamar javed bajwa, met u.s. ambassador david hale on wednesday and told him pakistan was actively working for peace in afghanistan.  we have done a lot ... and shall keep on doing our best, not to appease anyone but in line with our national interest and national policy,  bajwa was quoted in an army press statement as telling hale. pakistani foreign minister khawaja asif added his voice to a chorus of indignation over the u.s. criticism, reiterating pakistan s denial that it harbors militants.  they should not make pakistan a scapegoat for their failures in afghanistan,  asif said in an interview with geo tv late on tuesday.  a group of influential pakistani clerics including sami ul haq, who runs a islamic seminary where many senior afghan taliban studied, angrily condemned the united states.  america is the enemy of the muslim ummah (community),  haq told a press briefing along with other clerics who preach a jihadist doctrine.  the government of pakistan should quit the alliance for war against so called terrorism,  haq added.  the heavens will not fall if america gets angry with us.  pakistan has for years been battling homegrown islamist militants who are seeking to overthrow the state with bomb attacks and assassinations. but critics say the pakistani military nurtures other islamist factions, including the afghan taliban, which are seen as useful to pakistan s core confrontation with old rival india. asif said pakistan had suffered great losses from islamist militancy   the government estimates there have been 70,000 casualties in militant attacks, including 17,000 pakistanis killed   since pakistan joined the u.s.  war on terrorism  after the sept. 11, 2001, attacks on the united states. the relationship between the two countries has endured periods of extreme strain during the past decade, especially after al qaeda leader osama bin laden was found and killed by u.s. special forces in pakistan in a 2011 raid.   last year, a u.s. drone strike killed then afghan taliban leader mullah akhtar mansour in southwestern pakistan, an attack islamabad protested as a violation of its sovereignty. pakistan has denied knowledge that either bin laden or mansour were in the country.

" britain s government has not yet decided what it wants from a final brexit deal because it is still waiting to clear preliminary talks with brussels, finance minister philip hammond said on wednesday. with the clock ticking towards britain s scheduled march 2019 exit from the european union, the government is focused at the moment on getting a green light for the negotiations on future trade relations with the eu, hammond said.  the cabinet has had general discussions about our brexit negotiations but we haven t had a specific mandating of an end state position,  he told lawmakers in britain s parliament. prime minister theresa may s top ministers have big differences over what brexit should mean for britain, and over the extent of concessions that the country should offer in return for preferential access to the eu s single market. hammond said a group of key government ministers would deal with the issue once britain is given the go ahead by other eu countries that it can proceed with negotiations for a new, post brexit trade deal. that go ahead is on hold pending an agreement by the bloc s other 27 member states that britain has done enough on the terms of its divorce, now stuck on differences over how open the future border between ireland and northern ireland should be.  we are not yet at that stage and it would have been premature to  have that discussion until we reach that stage,  hammond told parliament s treasury committee. a spokesman for may, asked about hammond s comments, told reporters that government ministers would discuss the preferred outcome of the brexit talks before the end of the year.  we re not into phase two (of negotiations) yet, and brussels have been clear that they re not prepared to discuss  end state ,  the spokesman said. earlier on wednesday brexit minister david davis inflamed critics of the government s handling of brexit when he said he had not conducted formal sector by sector analyses of the effect of brexit on the economy, arguing they were not yet necessary. hammond has previously said he favors striking a  pragmatic  deal with the eu to minimize brexit s impact on businesses and the economy, angering some brexit supporters who favor a more definitive rupture with brussels. on wednesday, hammond reiterated that britain would leave the eu s single market and its customs union but that need not represent a big change to britain s relationship with the bloc, if britain replicates most of the current arrangements.  now, that would have consequences and some of our colleagues would not find that palatable, but it would be logically possible to approach it in that way,  he said. may hopes to secure the launch of the second phase of the brexit negotiations when she meets other eu leaders next week. but she suffered a setback this week when her allies in a political party from northern ireland objected to proposals for post brexit rules for the border with ireland. the democratic unionist party said on wednesday the stand off increased the likelihood of a  no deal  brexit   the nightmare scenario for many british businesses.

" a u.s. court struck down two republican drawn u.s. congressional districts in texas on tuesday, saying they were discriminatory and ordering a remedy ahead of elections in 2018, court papers showed. in the case that has been contested in federal courts for about six years, a three judge panel at u.s. district court in san antonio ruled lawmakers drew up the districts to undermine the influence of racial minority voters, who plaintiffs argued typically show more support for democrats than republicans.  the court also said that the maps laying them out must either be fixed by the state or the courts. the court said the 27th and 35th congressional districts were drawn in violation of the u.s. voting rights act. texas has 36 districts, with republicans holding 25 seats in the u.s. house of representatives and democrats 11. the court also faulted the state’s legislature for not heeding previous judicial plans and for making inadequate fixes to the maps drawn in 2011. “the discriminatory taint was not removed by the legislature’s enactment of the court’s interim plans,” the judges said in their decision. texas democrats saw the decision as a victory. “republicans initiated a deceitful legal strategy to deliberately silence texans from having a voice in their own government. today, the court unanimously agreed,” texas democratic party chair gilberto hinojosa said in a statement. republican texas attorney general ken paxton said the court did rule in texas’ favor in finding that one contested district, district 23, was lawful. however, paxton said in a statement the state has been abiding by the law and prior court guidance and he intended to ask the u.s. supreme court whether texas “had discriminatory intent when relying on the district court.” in court, lawyers for texas argued that the boundaries were drawn for republican partisan advantage, which they said is legal. they dismissed claims the districts were drawn illegally with the intention to disenfranchise racial and ethnic groups.

" from the basement to the third floor of democratic party headquarters in washington, dozens of election campaign workers are glued to screens playing back videos of donald trump and other republicans, digitally documenting their policy positions on everything from torture to climate change. the newly bulked up operation, including research, of more than 70 people is central to the democrats’ strategy to sink whoever the republicans nominate to run for the white house in the nov. 8 u.s. presidential election. party officials who provided reuters with details of the operation increasingly think their target will be trump, the new york businessman and former reality tv star who is the surprise republican front runner. the video clips will be used as grist for attack ads that will be deployed rapidly on social media sites any time trump, or either of his rivals, u.s. senator ted cruz of texas and ohio governor john kasich, strays during the general election campaign from policy proposals they touted in the nominating contests across the country. that could, in theory, hinder them from appealing to the millions of more moderate voters needed to beat former secretary of state hillary clinton or u.s. senator bernie sanders of vermont, the two competitors for the democratic nomination. democratic national committee (dnc) spokesman luis miranda, who provided reuters with a partial tour of the research operation, said voters in the run up to november’s election were “not going to be as responsive to the divisive rhetoric” that trump used in the republican campaign and that was a “key part of our general election strategy.” trump’s campaign did not respond to requests for comment on the democratic party operation. trump leads cruz with 678 delegates to the texan’s 423 delegates and kasich at 143 as of this week after a string of wins in states where his supporters favored his flamboyant rhetoric and plans to wall off the u.s. border with mexico, deport millions of undocumented immigrants and temporarily ban muslims from entering the country. trump has also called for a revision of laws that ban torture, and wants to scrap trade deals he blames for job losses. there are two more republican nominating contests on tuesday. a candidate needs to accumulate at least 1,237 delegates to win the nomination at the republican convention in july.   news and video monitoring have been election staples for years, but the latest operations bear little resemblance to the lower tech past because of leaps in technology and the speed with which a candidate’s remarks are distributed. “everything is on steroids,” said jamal simmons, a democratic consultant, who recalled campaigns continuously taping news channels on vhs tapes   a tedious process that limited how much could be monitored. other new technology, such as the live streaming application periscope, makes news from around the world available almost instantly, said holly shulman, a democratic strategist and former dnc official. “halfway around the world we were able to respond to something before the reporters looked at it even,” she said. the republican national committee (rnc) said it has also ramped up its video monitoring efforts, with a focus on clinton, adding staff and using newer technology. eight people on the rnc staff are devoted to monitoring news coverage, and the party said it was building a searchable digital library of clinton speeches, interviews and other events going back to 1991, the year before her husband bill clinton won the presidential election. attacks on trump by republican rivals and super pacs, independent political action committees that may raise unlimited sums of money, have failed to stop his campaign’s momentum. but the dnc said it believes its strategy will be effective. for one, the democrats believe the republican establishment’s efforts to block trump’s nomination have been slow and disorganized   and hampered by a fear of tearing the party apart. the democratic party is also betting the general electorate will be more easily persuaded to counter trump than registered republicans have been. clinton has a nearly 10 point lead over trump in a hypothetical general election match up, according to an average of polls gathered by real clear politics. the effort to hobble the former reality tv star takes a page out of reality television itself, where producers comb through thousands of hours of candid video, index it into an easily searchable library, and then paste together coherent narratives. the project helps address recommendations from the democratic victory task force, commissioned by dnc chair debbie wasserman schultz, which in february 2015 suggested the party prepare for the 2016 election and promote the party’s messaging. the dnc did similar work during the 2012 presidential election, but on a much smaller scale. its digital and social media staff went from 5 to 25 people over the past 18 or so months, spokesman miranda said. the current team divides its time on video from a wide range of sources   from national news to local channels, clips put up on youtube by individual users and campaigns, and events webcast by the campaigns themselves.  it also has scouts that record in the field. the work has yielded a number of attack videos already, many prepared and sent out at a moment’s notice. on feb. 28, for example, the party released a video slamming republican presidential hopefuls for their opposition to action on climate change, featuring them denying man made global warming alongside images of u.s. flooding, wildfires, droughts and heat waves. earlier in march, after trump cruised to victory in several state nominating contests, the dnc put out another 40 second video, mixing news clips talking about how trump is dominating his party. “these videos are getting tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of views across our various platforms,” miranda said. “he’s not going to get off as easy with us as with the rest of the republican field. we know what he’s said, we know where he’s flip flopped, where he’s made mistakes.” ",0
" the u.n. special envoy for syria on thursday said u.s. president barack obama could well keep working until his last day in office to end the war in syria, and russia did not want to be held responsible for the demolition of eastern aleppo. “i would never underestimate an outgoing u.s. president as a lame duck,” staffan de mistura said in an interview published on friday in germany’s sueddeutsche zeitung newspaper. “president obama .... and secretary of state john kerry are very motivated to end the greatest humanitarian tragedy of this century that has played out during their time in office. it’s about their legacy,” de mistura said. de mistura on tuesday had expressed concern that syrian president bashar al assad could launch a “brutal” new offensive to crush rebel held eastern aleppo before u.s. president elect donald trump takes office on jan. 20. he said his recent meetings in damascus showed the syrian regime had been emboldened by trump’s comments during the campaign about ending support for the syrian opposition. but he said he reminded syrian leaders that any u.s. president would face massive public pressure if the situation ended as a human tragedy with 200,000 people starving. de mistura said he feared eastern aleppo could be decimated by christmas if the bombardment continued, which would spur tens of thousands of refugees to flee to turkey, and could lead to a prolonged guerilla war in rural areas and car bombs in cities. the head of the syria “white helmets” volunteer group on thursday said besieged residents of aleppo were about ten days from starvation. the u.n. envoy said he believed russia’s claim that it was not bombing any targets in eastern aleppo, but added that moscow was also not stopping syrian forces from attacking hospitals or other targets in the city. still, he said he believed russia was serious about “not wanting to take responsibility for the destruction of eastern aleppo.” he said it was simply not in the interest of russia or the syrian government to be left with a completely destroyed country, five or six years of a “mini afghanistan,” and a type of guerrilla war in the rural areas.

" tweets by u.s. president donald trump are viewed in moscow as his official position and read by his russian counterpart vladimir putin, the kremlin said on tuesday. a prolific user of twitter before he was elected late last year, trump has continued to use the social media platform to voice his views on policy and world affairs since moving into the white house. kremlin spokesman dmitry peskov said on tuesday it was not his place to comment on trump s actions, but added:  in any case, everything which is published from his authorised twitter account is perceived by moscow as his official statement.  naturally, it is reported to putin along with other information about official statements by  politicians,  peskov said, adding that putin was not a twitter user himself. trump s activity on twitter have previously cause controversy. his tweets sparked outrage in britain last month and a sharp rebuke of prime minister theresa may when he retweeted anti islam videos from a british far right group.

" kosovo s newly elected prime minister, ex guerilla commander ramush haradinaj, pledged on saturday to maintain dialogue with a former foe serbia and put an end to endemic corruption. haradinaj was chosen to form a new government on thursday after his coalition struck an agreement with a smaller party, paving the way for them to take power.  lawmakers endorsed his appointment on saturday with 61 votes in the 120 seat parliament   ending a political deadlock that has persisted since elections on june 11.  there is no alternative to dialogue with serbia,  haradinaj told parliament.  despite  a tragic history, we can not change the fact that we are neighbors,  he said.  haradinaj s coalition comprises parties made up of former guerrillas who fought serbian forces in 1998 and 1999. that campaign led to accusations of war crimes against him, but he was acquitted twice by a united nations war crimes tribunal. his arrest in france in january on a serbian arrest warrant for war crimes soured relations between belgrade and pristina. haradinaj said his new government would fight corruption that has been deterring investors since kosovo declared independence from serbia in 2008.    we have an endemic corruption in all institutions,  he said, ahead of an expected vote on his new cabinet in parliament where his party will command a slim majority. on saturday, belgrade officials gave support to 10 serb deputies who have pledged to vote for haradinaj s government in parliament in return for three ministerial posts.  but opposition lawmakers criticized haradinaj for relying on votes of serb deputies who they say would seek belgrade s approval for any decisions they take.   it is unfortunate that after all these years the creation of kosovo institutions is entirely in the hands of belgrade. this is a catastrophic cabinet,  avdullah hoti of the opposition democratic league of kosovo (ldk) said. opposition mps left the chamber as the vote took place. central bank governor bedri hamza was appointed finance minister and behgjet pacolli, whom media refer to as the richest man in kosovo, as foreign minister. the new government will have the difficult task of tackling 30 percent unemployment, and improving relations with serbia, a precondition for the neighbors to move forward in their efforts to join the european union. kosovo declared independence from serbia in 2008, almost a decade after nato air strikes drove out serbian forces that had been accused of expelling and killing ethnic albanian civilians in a two year counter insurgency.

" in a white house marked by infighting, top economic aide gary cohn, a democrat and former goldman sachs banker, is muscling aside some of president donald trump’s hard right advisers to push more moderate, business friendly economic policies. cohn, 56, did not work on republican trump’s campaign and only got to know him after the november election, but he has emerged as one of the administration’s most powerful players in an ascent that rankles conservatives. trump refers to his director of the national economic council (nec), as “one of my geniuses,” according to one source close to cohn. more than half a dozen sources on wall street and in the  white house said cohn has gained the upper hand over trump’s chief strategist, steve bannon, the former head of the right wing website breitbart news and a champion of protectionist trade opposed by moderate republicans and many big companies. cohn is a key administration link to business executives and white house sources say he will lead the charge for trump on top domestic priorities such as tax reform, infrastructure and deregulation.  “gary’s singular focus is tax reform and he’s working to try and get that done in 2017,” said orin snyder, a partner at law firm gibson dunn and a long time friend of cohn.  “he is working to implement the president’s twin goals of economic growth and job creation. the tax plan will also include a reduction in the corporate rate, but also tax relief for middle  and low income americans.” some conservatives fear cohn may push through a tax plan that is unnecessarily complicated and argue that including tax relief for middle  and low income americans would not spur economic growth as much as cuts focused entirely or mostly on businesses and entrepreneurs. adam brandon, president of the conservative group freedomworks, is disappointed trump is not charging ahead with a plan unveiled last year during his campaign that would slash taxes on businesses and wealthy individuals.  that plan was shaped heavily by stephen moore, an economic policy expert at the conservative heritage foundation think tank, who advised trump’s campaign. but it has since been shelved. “i don’t like the idea of scrapping it and starting over again,” brandon said. a senior administration official said the white house has started from scratch on the tax plan and, while setting business tax cuts as the highest priority, is consulting with lawmakers, economists and business leaders before taking it to the republican led congress. two administration officials said reports that the white house was considering a carbon tax and a value added tax were incorrect, but that other ideas were on the table. “we are considering a multitude of options for tax reform,” a white house official said on sunday. associates of both trump and cohn say the two have developed a bond. people who have worked with cohn say he is loyal, direct and assertive, traits that trump likes.  crucially, cohn also has the trust of jared kushner, trump’s adviser and son in law, and his wife ivanka, trump’s daughter. cohn hired his staff more quickly than other top officials, building a reputation for competence in an administration hurt by early missteps over healthcare reform and a travel ban, the sources said. “gary is a huge asset to the trump administration. he’ll be of great help in eliminating unnecessary regulation, stimulating growth and reforming the tax code,” said billionaire hedge fund manager john paulson, an early backer of trump who knows cohn through wall street circles. the son of middle class parents in cleveland, ohio, cohn overcame dyslexia and worked in sales before elbowing his way into a position as a wall street trader and rising to become president and chief operating officer at goldman sachs group inc (gs.n).      kushner was a goldman sachs intern when he first crossed paths with cohn. after trump’s election victory, kushner paved the way for cohn to meet the president elect, who had spent much of the campaign blasting investment banks as modern day robber barons. trump soon named cohn his nec director. apparently paying more heed to cohn and other moderates on his team, trump last week said he was open to reappointing janet yellen as federal reserve chairman when her term is up and he also held back from naming china a currency manipulator.  both stances marked a reversal from his campaign when trump criticized yellen and vowed to label china a currency manipulator on “day one” of his administration, a move that could lead to punitive duties on chinese goods. sources close to cohn and inside the white house said there are sharp policy differences between cohn and both bannon and reince priebus, white house chief of staff. a white house spokesperson denied there was a power struggle inside the west wing.  cohn has already put his stamp on regulatory policy by working with kushner to successfully push wall street lawyer jay clayton for head of the securities and exchange commission after billionaire investor carl icahn, an early trump supporter, had vetted other candidates. clayton’s nomination has been advanced to the senate for a vote. the vacant federal reserve vice chairman’s seat is a key regulatory role cohn and his colleagues on the economic team want to fill soon. cohn has interviewed nearly two dozen candidates and has whittled the list down. randal quarles, a veteran of the george w. bush administration is one of several candidates left, a source familiar with the process said. cohn will also take a leading role in developing trump’s infrastructure plan to rebuild airports, roads and bridges. the biggest challenge may be figuring out how to pay for the initiative, which trump has estimated at $1 trillion. while conservatives are concerned by cohn, they note that bannon is still part of trump’s mercurial administration and that cohn could fall out of favor as quickly as he has risen.     “whoever is up today,” brandon said, “could be gone tomorrow.” ",0
" republican senate leaders aim to hold a procedural vote as early as tuesday to take up legislation to repeal or replace obamacare, but it remained unclear which version of the bill senators would vote on. president donald trump and congressional republicans campaigned on a pledge to roll back former president barack obama’s signature healthcare law, the 2010 affordable care act, also known as obamacare. senator john thune, a member of the republican leadership, told “fox news sunday” the initial vote was simply a way to open debate on the bill so that senators from both parties could offer amendments. “the first vote, which will occur sometime this week, will be to proceed to the consideration of that legislation and to at least have a debate where we can have an open amendment process,” thune said. the republican controlled house in may passed its version of a healthcare bill. senate republicans have considered two versions of related legislation but have been unable to reach consensus after estimates showed as many as 22 million fewer americans would be insured if the proposals became law. a plan to repeal obamacare without replacing it also ran aground. republicans control a narrow majority in the senate, holding 52 of 100 seats. with the democrats united in opposition to the republican effort, senator majority leader mitch mcconnell can only afford to lose the votes of two republican senators. the fate of any legislation to rewrite obamacare is uncertain as many republicans have not yet made clear their positions. “it appears we’ll have a vote on tuesday but we don’t know whether we’ll be voting on the house bill, the first version of the senate bill, the second version of the senate bill,” republican senator susan collins told cbs’ “face the nation” on sunday. collins is a moderate republican who has objected to prior versions of the senate bill and also to repealing obamacare without replacing it. trump suggested last week that he was fine with letting obamacare fail, but he then switched course and invited republican senators to the white house to try to hash out a healthcare deal. the republican effort has also been complicated by the absence of republican senator john mccain, who has been diagnosed with brain cancer and has been in his home state of arizona weighing treatment options.

" british foreign minister boris johnson will travel to moscow later this year to discuss international security issues, the british government said on friday. johnson canceled what would have been the first visit to russia in five years by a british foreign secretary in april due to a poison gas attack in a rebel held area of syria that prompted the united states to carry out missile strikes. moscow backs syrian government forces against rebels in the country s civil war. russian foreign minister sergei lavrov subsequently met johnson at the united nations in september.   our relationship with russia is not straightforward,  johnson said in a statement.  that is all the more reason to be talking to russia   to manage our differences and cooperate where possible for the security of both our nations and the international community.  relations between britain and russia have been strained since the murder of ex kgb agent alexander litvinenko in london in 2006, a killing which a british inquiry said was probably approved by president vladimir putin. britain s foreign ministry said johnson, on his moscow visit, wished to discuss north korea, iran and regional stability in the middle east, as well as security for the 2018 world cup soccer tournament in russia.  we will continue to challenge russia s approach where we disagree, whether that is russia s actions in syria or its aggression toward ukraine. my visit will provide an opportunity to talk about these issues and more, face to face,  johnson said.

"speaking at a rotary club gathering in kentucky on monday, senate majority leader mitch mcconnell vented about how president donald trump s lack of political experience has led to him setting  excessive expectations  for legislative priorities.mcconnell, r-ky., told the group in florence that he found it  extremely irritating  that congress has earned the reputation of not accomplishing anything. part of the reason i think that the storyline is that we haven t done much is because, in part, the president and others have set these early timelines about things need to be done by a certain point,  said mcconnell, a republican and the state s senior senator.according to the latest real clear politics poll, congress currently has a 15% approval rating and a 73.3% disapproval rating. there is no mention anywhere in the poll that president trump is somehow responsible for congress  abysmal approval numbers: trump, a political newcomer, as mcconnell noted, has a habit of declaring progress on major priorities that do not necessarily reflect the reality of lawmaking.for example, as the house was in the midst of negotiations about its obamacare replacement bill in february, trump announced that congress was in the  final stages  of its bill and said it would be ready for  submitting  in march. while the house bill was unveiled in march, that chamber didn t vote on it until may, and health care votes continued until the end of july.that sort of disconnect has led to trump s expressing disappointment when bills   chief among them health care reform   fail to end up on his desk, even though, as with health care, the political reality indicated all along how difficult it was going to be to pass legislation. our new president, of course, has not been in this line of work before. and i think he had excessive expectations about how quickly things happen in the democratic process,  mcconnell told the group.  so part of the reason i think people feel we re underperforming is because too many artificial deadlines   unrelated to the reality of the complexity of legislating   may not have been fully understood.   abc newswatch:",1

" republican presidential hopeful ted cruz split victories in four nominating contests with front runner donald trump on saturday, bolstering cruz’s argument that he represents the party’s best chance to stop the brash new york billionaire. the results were a repudiation of a republican establishment that has bristled at the prospect of either cruz or trump winning the party’s nomination and has largely lined up behind u.s. senator marco rubio of florida, who was shut out in all four contests. “i think it’s time that he dropped out of the race,” trump said of rubio after the contests. “i want ted one on one.” cruz won kansas and maine on saturday, while trump won the bigger states of louisiana and kentucky, holding onto his lead in the race for the republican nomination for the november 8 presidential election, even though cruz captured more delegates on saturday. the next big contest, and a crucial one, will be tuesday’s primary in the industrial state of michigan. republicans in three other states, mississippi, idaho and hawaii, also will vote on tuesday. puerto rico republicans will vote on sunday. in the democratic race, front runner hillary clinton won in louisiana, and her rival bernie sanders, a u.s. senator from vermont, won in kansas and nebraska, in results that did not substantially change clinton’s big delegate lead. mainstream republicans have blanched at trump’s calls to build a wall on the border with mexico, round up and deport 11 million undocumented immigrants and temporarily bar all muslims from entering the united states. but the party’s establishment has not been much happier with cruz, who has alienated many party leaders in washington. “it looks like it will be the angry trump voters against the purist conservative cruz voters,” said washington based republican strategist ron bonjean. “the establishment is just being left out.” a spokesman for rubio, who spent the past week launching harsh personal attacks on trump, said the senator would push on with an eye on the march 15 contest in florida. “after we win the florida primary, the map, the momentum and the money is going to be on our side,” spokesman alex conant said in a statement. cruz, a first term u.s. senator from texas who has promoted himself as more of a true conservative than trump, said the results showed he was gaining momentum in the race to catch the real estate mogul. cruz, 45, has run as an outsider bent on shaking up the republican establishment in washington. a favorite of evangelicals, he has called for the united states to “carpet bomb” the islamic state militant group and has pledged to eliminate the tax collecting internal revenue service and four cabinet agencies and to enact a balanced budget amendment. “the scream you hear, the howl that comes from washington, d.c., is utter terror at what ‘we the people’ are doing together,” cruz told supporters in coeur d’alene, idaho, after his early win in kansas. “what we’re seeing is the public coming together, libertarians coming together, men and women who love the constitution coming together and uniting and standing as one behind this campaign,” cruz said. trump, 69, has a substantial lead in the delegates needed to secure the nomination at the republican national convention, but since winning seven of the 11 contests on super tuesday he has come under withering fire from a republican establishment worried he will lead the party to defeat in november’s election. [nl2n16c08f] but endorsements from establishment republicans have failed to sway voters. rubio won the backing of kansas governor sam brownback but still came in third there. the four republican contests on saturday together accounted for just 155 delegates. cruz won 64 delegates on saturday, while trump took 49. the races on saturday were open only to registered republicans, excluding the independent and disaffected democratic voters who have helped trump’s surge to the lead. the anti trump forces have a short window to stop the caustic businessman, who ahead of saturday had accumulated 319 of the 1,237 delegates needed to win the nomination at july’s republican national convention, outpacing cruz, who had 226 delegates. on march 15, the delegate rich states of florida, illinois, ohio, missouri and north carolina will vote. both florida and ohio use the winner take all method to allocate republican delegates, making the stakes in those states particularly high. all of the republican contests on saturday, and through march 14, award delegates proportionate to the popular vote, although some states set minimum thresholds to qualify for any delegates. if trump takes both florida and ohio he would be nearly impossible to stop. there are a total of 358 delegates at stake in the five states voting march 15, including 99 in florida and 66 in ohio.  on the democratic side, clinton has opened up a big delegate lead and sanders might have a tough time making up the difference. all states in the democratic race award their delegates proportionally, meaning clinton can keep piling up delegates even in states she loses. the three states holding democratic contests on saturday had a total of 109 delegates at stake. the early estimates were that clinton, who appeared headed to a smashing nearly 50 point win in louisiana, had won at least 48 delegates on tuesday and sanders 37. but sanders made it clear he was not planning to end his white house quest anytime soon. “we have the momentum. we have a path toward victory. our campaign is just getting started,” he said in a statement after his wins on saturday.

" the kansas senate gave final approval on tuesday to a bill expanding eligibility for medicaid under the federal affordable care act (aca) even though the measure faces a likely veto by republican governor sam brownback. the 25 14 senate vote followed the house’s 81 44 passage of the bill last month, with the vote totals falling short of veto proof margins in both republican controlled chambers. in a tweet on monday, melika willoughby, the governor’s spokeswoman, said instead of addressing the health care needs of vulnerable residents in a sustainable way, the legislature was choosing to expand “a failing entitlement program.” “to expand obamacare when the program is in a death spiral is not responsible policy,” she tweeted. after legislation to replace and repeal the act championed by former president barack obama was pulled in the u.s. house last week, president donald trump warned obamacare would collapse. the replacement bill pushed by house speaker paul ryan would have ended the aca’s expansion of medicaid, the federal and state funded insurance program for the poor and disabled. kansas was not among the 31 states as of 2016 that had opted to expand medicaid with the federal government footing much of the cost under obamacare. with the aca’s enhanced federal funding, kansas’ expansion effective jan. 1, 2018 would cost the state an estimated $31 million in fiscal 2018, which begins july 1, and $67 million in fiscal 2019 with the addition of more than 180,000 recipients, according to estimates cited in a legislative report on the bill. without enhanced federal matching funds, the state’s costs would balloon to $465 million by fiscal 2019. kansas is already struggling with a structural budget deficit largely due to tax cuts enacted in 2012. in addition, the state supreme court ruled earlier this month that kansas was underfunding public schools in violation of a state constitutional requirement for adequacy.

" the obama administration will announce as soon as friday an overhaul of how the united states manages coal development on federal land, according to government and conservationist sources, in a further move to confront climate change. in his state of the union address on tuesday, democratic president barack obama said he would “change the way we manage our oil and coal resources, so that they better reflect the costs they impose on taxpayers and our planet.” the new plan will require federal officials, when weighing land use decisions, to consider how mining and burning coal adds to greenhouse gas pollution, said environmental group sources familiar with the plans. the overhaul also will aim to maximize returns for taxpayers by updating royalty rates when mining companies pull coal from federal land, said the sources. “we’re working to have this tomorrow,” said a bureau of land management official who declined to give details on the administration’s plans. environmentalists have urged the white house to freeze new coal leases on federal land until it accounts for how that fossil fuel development contributes to climate change. a moratorium on coal leases could be part of the reform, said environmental sources familiar with the effort. coal leases are often awarded without a competitive bidding process, frequently going to a single bidder, and officials can undervalue the fuel heading to market, the nonpartisan government accountability office has concluded. “public lands should be developed in the public interest but taxpayers have been shortchanged for decades,” said theo spencer of the natural resources defense council, an environmental group. the energy information administration says roughly 41 percent of u.s. coal production occurs on federal land. the coal industry had been battered in recent years by competition from cheap natural gas and clean air regulations that have raised costs for burning the black rock. this week, arch coal, one of the nation’s largest coal companies, filed for bankruptcy   the latest mining company to seek protection from creditors in the current downturn. the national mining association was not immediately available for comment.

" when president donald trump told the palestinian president of his intention to recognize jerusalem as israel s capital, he assured him a peace plan being put together would please the palestinians, officials said, an apparent effort to limit fallout over his break with longtime u.s. policy.         trump s phone call to mahmoud abbas on tuesday, the day before he made his bombshell announcement on jerusalem, appeared to shed new light on behind the scenes efforts by white house advisers to craft a peace blueprint expected to be rolled out in the first half of 2018 but which has now been thrown into doubt because of an angry outcry across the middle east. with palestinians declaring it will be difficult for the united states to act as an honest broker after essentially siding with israel on one of the central disputes in the conflict, administration officials said they expected a  cooling off period.  trump s team, led by his son in law and senior adviser, jared kushner, will press on with development of a plan to serve as the foundation for renewed israeli palestinian negotiations, hoping the furor will blow over and that any pause in diplomatic contacts with the palestinians will not last long, u.s. officials said. but amid protests in the palestinian territories and uncertainty about whether the palestinians will stay engaged in the peace effort, one u.s. official said the process could still be disrupted.  if they are still saying they re not going to talk, we re not going to do it then,  the official said. washington s major western and arab allies have warned that trump s decision on jerusalem could doom attempts to achieve what the u.s. president has called the  ultimate deal  of israeli palestinian peace. details of the negotiating framework have yet to be finalized and there is little indication of tangible progress. but officials said it would deal with all the major issues, including jerusalem, borders, security, the future of jewish settlements on occupied land and the fate of palestinian refugees, and would also call for saudi arabia and other gulf states to provide significant financial support to the palestinians. in his call to abbas on tuesday, trump sought to temper the blow from his jerusalem announcement by stressing that the palestinians stood to gain from the peace plan that kushner and u.s. middle east envoy jason greenblatt were crafting, according to two u.s. and two palestinian officials who spoke on condition of anonymity. trump told abbas, a western backed moderate, that the final peace blueprint would offer the palestinians an important settlement that they would be pleased with, but did not provide specifics, the sources said. abbas told trump in response that any peace process must result in the palestinians having their capital in east jerusalem, a palestinian official said. israel captured east jerusalem in the 1967 arab israeli war and later annexed it in a move not recognized internationally. a senior u.s. official said trump told abbas he wanted to discuss the issues in person and invited him to visit the white house, although the timing was unclear. palestinians have grown increasingly concerned that any plan trump unveils will shortchange them, a fear that deepened with trump s formal endorsement of jerusalem as israel s capital, upending decades of u.s. policy that the ancient city s status must be decided in negotiations. jerusalem is home to sites holy to muslims, jews and christians. kushner, who had no government or diplomatic experience before joining his father in law s white house, has mostly kept his discussions under wraps. u.s. officials say kushner backed trump s decision to recognize jerusalem as israel s capital and order the eventual relocation of the u.s. embassy there from tel aviv, although he was aware of the potential for complicating his peace efforts. but one white house official said that because the peace effort had not yet led to negotiations between the two sides, kushner s team believed the initial outcry over the jerusalem decision could eventually be overcome. the official said the plan, which he described as comprehensive and going beyond frameworks put forth by previous u.s. administrations, would likely be unveiled before the middle of next year. a key test of keeping the peace efforts on track will be whether abbas goes ahead with a scheduled meeting with u.s. vice president mike pence when he visits the region in mid december.  a senior palestinian official said on thursday that pence was  unwelcome in palestine.  trump, the officials said, had insisted that u.s. recognition of jerusalem as israel s capital was not meant to prejudge the outcome of future negotiations on that issue or others between the two sides. u.s. officials acknowledged that trump s jerusalem moves could also put a damper on cooperation from arab states such as saudi arabia, egypt and jordan, which the administration is trying to enlist in the peace process. they contended, however, that the broader arab world was also concerned about keeping trump involved in confronting iran and fighting islamic state militants and was therefore unlikely to remain disengaged for long from efforts to solve the israeli palestinian conflict. one u.s. official said the palestinians were in such a weak position that they would ultimately have no choice but to stay involved in u.s. led peace efforts. another argument that trump s aides will likely make to palestinians is that having granted israel recognition of its claim to jerusalem, the u.s. leader might now have more leverage for seeking concessions later on from israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu, the u.s. official said.

" police in germany on tuesday arrested five people suspected of smuggling nigerian men into the country through fake marriages, the german federal police said in a statement. four hundred police officers raided 41 apartments and rooms believed to be linked to the gang in berlin and other german cities, it said. the gang s suspected leaders   four women and a man, ranging in age from 46 to 65   were arrested. germany s newspaper bild reported that a german federal police investigation conducted together with portuguese authorities and europol had found at least 70 men were brought in illegally through arranged marriages with portuguese women. europol, the european union s law enforcement agency, served as a host for operational meetings between the portuguese and german investigators, the police said. clients had paid up to 13,000 euros ($15,550) for fake certificates, with part of the sum going to women who would fly from portugal to join their  husbands  at the german immigration office to apply for an eu residency permit. similar cases were detected in june when the police found that more than 700 german men in berlin had married pregnant asylum seekers from vietnam, africa and eastern europe for money so the mothers would obtain a residency permit and for the future babies to be born as german citizens. the german interior ministry estimates there are about 5,000 such cases per year nationwide.

" china is facing heightened threats from foreign infiltration via religion and from the spread of extremism, a top official for religious affairs said on tuesday, after strict new rules were passed to manage religious practice in the country. president xi jinping has emphasized the need to guard against foreign infiltration through religion and to prevent the spread of  extremist  ideology, while also being tolerant of traditional faiths that he sees as a salve to social ills. china s cabinet last week passed updated rules to regulate religion so as to bolster national security, fight extremism and restrict faith practiced outside state approved organizations. the new rules take effect in february. wang zuoan, the head of china s religious affairs bureau, said the revision was urgently needed because  the foreign use of religion to infiltrate (china) intensifies by the day and religious extremist thought is spreading in some areas.    issues with religion on the internet are starting to break out ... and illegal religious gatherings in some places continue despite bans,  he added, writing in the official paper of the ruling communist party, the people s daily. wang said that freedom of religious faith is protected by the new rules.  at the same time, freedom of religious faith is not equal to religious activities taking place without legal restrictions,  he added. religion within china needed to be  sinicized , a term officials use to describe the adjusting of religion to fit chinese culture as interpreted by the party.  these rules will help maintain the sinicization of religion in our country ... and keep to the correct path of adapting religion to a socialist society,  he said. china s five officially sanctioned religions   buddhism, taoism, islam, catholicism and christianity   vowed to fight  desinicization  at a forum on the topic held in beijing last week, according state media. china has seen a revival of religious practice in recent decades after faith was effectively banned during the cultural revolution in the 1960s.  official estimates put the number of believers at around 100 million, but scholars argue that the real number could be many times higher, due to many believers being unregistered with authorities. china requires places of worship to be registered with authorities, but many believers shun official settings in preference for private gatherings often known as  underground  churches.

" russia on thursday named nine u.s. government sponsored news outlets likely to be labeled  foreign agents  under a new law  that is being rushed through parliament in response to what moscow says is unacceptable u.s. pressure on russian media. russia s lower house of parliament approved the law   allowing moscow to force foreign media to brand news they provide to russians as the work of  foreign agents  and to disclose their funding sources   on wednesday. the legislation needs approval from the upper house of parliament, which is likely to happen next week, and the signature of president vladimir putin before it becomes law. the russian justice ministry on thursday published a list of nine u.s. backed news outlets that it said could be affected by the changes, which it said in a statement on its website were likely to become law  in the near future.  it said it had written to the u.s. government sponsored voice of america (voa) and radio free europe/radio liberty (rfe/rl), along with seven separate russian or local language news outlets run by rfe/rl. one of the seven outlets provides news on crimea, which russia annexed from ukraine in 2014, one on siberia, and one on the predominantly muslim north caucasus region. another covers provincial russia, one is an online tv station, another covers the mostly muslim region of tatarstan, and the other is a news portal that fact checks the statements of russian officials. russia s broadside against u.s. media is part of the fallout from allegations that the kremlin interfered in the u.s. presidential election last year in favor of donald trump. u.s. intelligence officials accuse the kremlin of using russian media organizations it finances to influence u.s. voters, and this week washington required russian state broadcaster rt to register a u.s. based affiliate company as a  foreign agent .  the kremlin denies meddling in the election and has said the restrictions on russian broadcasters in the united states amount to an attack on free speech. the new media law in russia is retaliation, it says.  the draft legislation states that russian authorities can designate foreign media as  foreign agents , making them subject to the same requirements that are applied to foreign funded non governmental organizations under a 2012 law. under that law,  foreign agents  must include in any information they publish or broadcast to russian audiences a mention of their  foreign agent  designation. they also must apply for inclusion in a government register, submit regular reports on their sources of funding, on their objectives, on how they spend their money, and who their managers are. they can be subject to spot checks by the authorities to make sure they comply with the rules, according to the 2012 law, which has forced some ngos to close. rfe/rl said in a statement it did not want to speculate what steps russia might take against it next, and looked forward to continuing its journalistic work. voa director amanda bennett has said the station remains committed to providing independent news to global audiences.

" lebanese prime minister saad al hariri said on monday that the  political and militant group hezbollah must stop interfering in regional conflicts and accept a neutral policy to bring an end to lebanon s political crisis.  the iranian backed hezbollah, which forms part of the lebanese government, is fighting alongside syrian president bashar al assad in syria and in iraq against islamic state militants. gulf monarchies have accused the shi ite group of also supporting the houthi group in yemen and of backing militants in bahrain. hezbollah denies any activity in yemen or bahrain. hariri s main patron is saudi arabia, iran s main regional rival, which has also intervened in regional conflicts.   i don t want a political party in my government that interferes in arab countries against other arab countries,  hariri said in an interview recorded on monday with french broadcaster cnews.   i am waiting for the neutrality which we agreed on in the government,  he said.  one can t say one thing and do something else.  hariri shocked lebanon on nov 4 by resigning from his post in a statement from saudi arabia. his resignation, however, has not yet been accepted.   president michel aoun held talks on monday with other lebanese political leaders over the future of hariri s government but gave no sign whether they discussed hariri s demand that the country steer clear of regional turmoil.  lebanon cannot resolve a question like hezbollah which is in syria, iraq, everywhere because of iran. it is a regional political solution that needs to be done,  hariri said.  the interference of iran affects us all. if we want a policy that is good for the region we shouldn t be interfering.   he said he was ready to stay on as prime minister if hezbollah accepted to stick by the state policy of staying out of regional conflicts.  however, he said he would resign if hezbollah did not keep to that, although consultations so far had been positive.  i think in the interest of lebanon, hezbollah is carrying out a positive dialogue. they know we have to remain neutral in the region.   he said that if this week s consultations ended positively he would possibly modify the make up of the government and added that he was open to elections before next year.

" minnesota’s democratic lieutenant governor tina smith was appointed as u.s. senator on wednesday to replace al franken, who resigned after being accused of sexual harassment. smith, 59, will serve a one year term concluding in january 2019, governor mark dayton said at a news conference, and will run in a special election for the seat in november next year. dayton said he listened to the views of many minnesotans before deciding on smith. “there is no one i trust more to assume the responsibilities of this important office,” dayton said. “i know that she will be a superb senator, representing the best interests of our state and our citizens.” smith told reporters at the news conference that she will be a fierce advocate on behalf of the state, pushing for economic opportunity and fairness. “this is a difficult moment for us but even now i am now filled with optimism,” she said. “though i never anticipated this moment, i am resolved to do everything i can to move minnesota forward.”  smith became lieutenant governor in january 2014. she previously worked as dayton’s chief of staff and held positions at general mills and planned parenthood. last week franken, 66, also a democrat, announced his resignation from the seat he has held since 2009. the former comedian has denied some of the allegations against him and questioned others. reuters has not independently verified the accusations against him. during wednesday’s news conference, smith thanked franken for his service and called him a “champion” for the state. she said she respected his decision to resign. “sexual harassment is disrespectful to people and can’t be tolerated,” smith said. “i can promise you that i’ll be working on these issues when i get to washington, d.c.” smith will be an excellent senator, franken said. “her record of accomplishment as lieutenant governor demonstrates that she’ll be an effective senator who knows how to work across party lines to get things done for minnesota,” franken said in a statement on wednesday. minnesota will soon have two women senators, as smith will join fellow democrat amy klobuchar, 57, who in 2006 became the state’s first female elected senator and was re elected in 2012. minnesota’s first female senator, muriel humphrey, was appointed in 1978 to fill the seat of her husband, hubert humphrey, following his death. the republican party of minnesota said smith will be entering office with what it called the “political baggage” of the dayton administration, as well as a “well established track record of far left policies.” “minnesota republicans look forward to electing a republican to the u.s. senate in 2018,” its chairwoman, jennifer carnahan, said in a statement.  the republican party’s slim majority in the u.s. senate will not be affected by the move to replace franken. democrats will gain a seat to cut republican’s majority in the 100 member senate to 51 after tuesday night’s victory by doug jones over republican candidate roy moore in a special election in alabama.

" the department of homeland security violated two court orders in the days after u.s. president donald trump issued a temporary travel ban on citizens of seven muslim majority countries, according to the department’s watchdog. dhs inspector general john roth summarized his findings in a letter dated monday to three democratic u.s. senators, saying he has been unable to release the full 87 page report, completed six weeks ago. he said the delay was due to a dispute with dhs higher ups over redactions, which would “deprive congress and the public of significant insights into the operation of the department,” roth said. after the jan. 27 order by the president, the u.s. customs and border protection agency (cbp) “was very aggressive in preventing affected travelers from boarding aircraft bound for the united states, and took actions that, in our view, violated two separate court orders,” roth said. trump banned the entry of citizens from seven muslim majority countries for 90 days. his order was issued with little warning to major u.s. agencies, sparking confusion at airports in the united states and around the world over its scope and impact. civil rights groups quickly challenged the travel ban, managing to block implementation of some of its key measures as protesters, lawyers and elected officials rushed to major u.s. airports where citizens of the seven countries had been detained. at u.s. ports of entry, cbp officials largely complied with court orders blocking the ban, though they were hampered by a lack of guidance from superiors, roth wrote in his letter.  cbp officials “had virtually no warning” that trump was issuing his travel ban “or of the scope of the order, and was caught by surprise,” roth said. still, cbp officers at u.s. airports “attempted in good faith to obey court orders,” he said. in one case, at dulles international airport near washington, cbp stopped a departing airplane that was taxiing so an affected traveler could be admitted to the united states. from jan. 29 to feb. 3, cbp instructed airlines to prevent boston bound passengers from the seven countries from flying to the united states in violation of an order by a federal court in massachusetts. all of the airlines except lufthansa (lhag.de) followed cbp instructions. when lufthansa’s passengers arrived in boston, they were allowed to enter, roth said. cbp also continued to issue “no board” instructions to airlines even after a separate nationwide federal court order on jan. 31 blocked the agency from doing so, roth said. top dhs officials are reviewing roth’s report and may invoke a form of governmental privilege which he said “would prevent us from releasing to you significant portions of the report. i am very troubled by this development.” agency officials “conducted themselves professionally, and in a legal manner, as they implemented an executive order issued by the president,” said tyler q. houlton, a dhs spokesman. parts of the report are subject to “privileges afforded by well recognized law,” he said since the travel ban’s implementation is subject to lawsuits and court orders.

" the white house is hoping to kick start its stalled legislative agenda with congressional action on healthcare reform this summer that will clear the way for lawmakers to begin work on a major tax bill after the sept. 4 labor day holiday, an administration official said on monday.     senate republicans will vote on their version of healthcare reform legislation before lawmakers’ august recess, white house director of legislative affairs marc short said. the house of representatives passed a bill in may. “there’s been a lot of discussions with staff,” short told reporters at a briefing. “i think the text is pretty far along.” congress will then turn its focus to overhauling the tax code in september. while the administration would prefer that the effort not add to the national debt, short stressed that the top priority would be cutting taxes. “we want it to be revenue neutral, and we are still supportive of tax reform, but i am also saying to you that what we believe is most important to get the economy going is the tax cuts,” he said.  president donald trump will meet with the republican leaders of the house and the senate, paul ryan and mitch mcconnell, on tuesday to discuss the path forward for his agenda, said white house spokeswoman lindsay walters. trump has pressed for quicker action in congress, but his administration has also been hampered by investigations into alleged ties between trump’s election campaign and russia. the trump administration has outlined a broad plan that would cut tax rates for businesses and streamline the tax system for individuals. but, the proposal has been short on details — including the cost of the tax cuts and what loopholes would be closed.      the healthcare bill passed by the house could result in 23 million people losing insurance, the congressional budget office estimated, a conclusion that republicans were quick to challenge. the bill would also reduce federal deficits by $119 billion between 2017 and 2026, according to the analysis. short said he believed that the senate healthcare bill would be “similar” to the house package.  senator john cornyn, the no.2 republican in the senate, said monday evening he thought there would be a vote on a healthcare bill in the senate in july. short also said the white house expects for congress to raise the government’s borrowing authority, also known as the debt limit, before the august recess.

" a u.s. judge on monday ordered the unsealing of the application used to obtain a search warrant that allowed the fbi to gain access to emails related to democratic presidential nominee hillary clinton’s private server before the nov. 8 election. u.s. district judge kevin castel in manhattan directed the release by tuesday of redacted materials used to obtain a search warrant after federal bureau of investigation director james comey informed congress of newly discovered emails on oct. 28. comey’s letter drew new attention to a damaging issue for clinton, the democratic presidential nominee, and roiled the campaign 11 days before the nov. 8 election, won by republican donald trump. the search warrant materials’ release sought by randol schoenberg, a los angeles based lawyer, who in court papers said transparency was crucial given the potential influence the probe had on the election’s outcome. sources close to the investigation have said the emails were discovered during an unrelated probe into former democratic u.s. representative anthony weiner, the estranged husband of top clinton aide huma abedin. in his order, castel said he would allow the redaction of the identities of two unnamed individuals, one of whom is subject to an “ongoing criminal investigation.” but he said the “strong presumption of access attached to the search warrant and related materials is not overcome by any remaining privacy interest of secretary clinton.” lawyers for clinton and abedin did not immediately respond to requests for comment, nor did the u.s. justice department. a lawyer for weiner had no immediate comment. clinton used the server while she was secretary of state from 2009 to 2013. in july, comey recommended no criminal charges be brought over clinton’s handing of classified information in the emails, although he said she and her colleagues were “extremely careless” in handling such information. in his oct. 28 letter to congress, comey said emails potentially related to the clinton server probe had been discovered in an “unrelated case.” sources close to the investigation have said the emails were discovered during an unrelated probe into weiner following a media report that he engaged in sexually explicit cellphone and online messaging with a 15 year old girl. federal investigators got a warrant to examine the emails to see if they were related to the probe into clinton’s private server. only two days before the election, comey disclosed that the emails did nothing to change his earlier recommendation.

" the u.s. justice department filed an appeal late saturday to restore president donald trump’s immigration order barring citizens from seven mainly muslim countries and temporarily banning refugees, even as travelers raced to enter the country while the ban was lifted. the government moved to reverse a federal judge’s friday order that lifted the travel ban and warned the decision posed an immediate harm to the public, thwarted enforcement of an executive order and “second guesses the president’s national security judgment about the quantum of risk posed by the admission of certain classes of (non citizens) and the best means of minimizing that risk.”  friday’s ruling prompted trump to denounce the “so called” judge in a series of tweets on saturday..  the appeal now goes to a three judge panel which can act at anytime to uphold the order or suspend it pending a full appeal. a justice department spokesman declined to comment beyond the filing. a ruling could come at any time. seattle u.s. district judge james robart’s decision barred the administration from enforcing the sweeping order that also indefinitely barred syrian refugee admissions and prompted large protests across the united states.  trump, whose personal attack on robart, decrying his opinion as “ridiculous,” went too far for some who said the president was undermining an institution designed to check the power of the white house and congress, said he was confident the government would prevail. “we’ll win. for the safety of the country, we’ll win,” he told reporters in florida. robart’s ruling came in a case brought by the state attorney general of washington state and was backed by major state employers amazon.com inc and expedia inc.. the lawsuit is one of several now filed against the trump executive order around the united states, but it was the first case leading to a broad decision that applies nationwide. the justice department appeal criticized robart’s legal reasoning, saying it violates the separation of powers and steps on the president’s authority as commander chief. the appeal said the state of washington lacked standing to challenge the order and denied that the order “favors christians at the expense of muslims.” congress gave the president “the unreviewable authority to suspend the admission of any class” of visitor, the justice department wrote. “courts are particularly ill equipped to second guess the president’s prospective judgment about future risks,” the appeal said, calling the decision “vastly overbroad.” washington state lawyers worked around the clock last weekend against the backdrop of turbulent scenes at u.s. airports, where immigrants were detained by federal officials unprepared to implement the president’s directive. a spokesman for washington state attorney general bob ferguson didn’t immediately comment early sunday. the u.s. state department and department of homeland security said they were complying with robart’s order and many visitors are expected to start arriving on sunday, while the government said it expects to begin admitting refugees again on monday. a decision to reinstate trump’s order could again cause havoc at u.s. airports because some visitors are in transit, as was the case when the order took effect on jan. 27. as the ban lifted friday, refugees and thousands of travelers from iran, iraq, libya, somalia, sudan, syria and yemen who had been stopped in their tracks last weekend by the  executive order scrambled to get flights to quickly enter the united states. the panel that will decide whether to immediately block the ruling includes three judges appointed by former republican president george w. bush and two former democratic presidents, jimmy carter and barack obama. u.s. immigration advocacy groups including the american civil liberties union on saturday in a joint statement urged those with now valid visas from the seven nations “to consider rebooking travel to the united states immediately” because the ruling could be overturned or put on hold. a u.s. state department email reviewed by reuters said the department is working to begin admitting refugees including syrians as soon as monday. trump’s jan. 27 order had barred admission of citizens from seven majority muslim nations for 90 days, suspended all refugee admissions for 120 days and indefinitely barred syrian refugees.  it is unusual for a president to attack a member of the judiciary, which the u.s. constitution designates as a check to the power of the executive branch and congress. reached by email saturday, robart declined comment on trump’s tweets. democratic u.s. senator patrick leahy of vermont said in a statement saturday that trump’s “hostility toward the rule of law is not just embarrassing, it is dangerous. he seems intent on precipitating a constitutional crisis.” in an interview with abc scheduled to air sunday, vice president mike pence said he did not think that trump’s criticisms of the judge undermined the separation of powers. the court ruling was the first move in what could be months of legal challenges to trump’s push to clamp down on immigration. the sudden reversal of the ban catapulted would be immigrants back to airports, with uncertainty over how long the window to enter the united states will remain open. in erbil, the capital of the kurdish region of northern iraq, fuad sharef and his family prepared to fly on saturday to istanbul and then new york before starting a new life in nashville, tennessee. virtually all refugees also were barred by trump’s order, upending the lives of thousands of people who have spent years seeking asylum in the united states.

" theresa may s  constructive spirit  won a cautious welcome from the european union on friday, though the british prime minister s keynote brexit speech raised more questions than answers for some and they want more details next week.  the speech shows a willingness to move forward, as time is of the essence,  the eu s chief brexit negotiator michel barnier said in a lengthy statement, adding that may s specially staged event in renaissance florence chimed with the spirit of europe. echoing reactions from diplomats and officials involved in the negotiations who spoke privately to reuters, barnier said it was a  step forward  that may said british courts would protect eu citizens in britain based directly on a new eu uk treaty, not on british law, and would take future eu case law into account. but as with vaguer comments about the eu budget, in which may said the other 27 countries would not be left out of pocket over the eu financial cycle ending in december 2020, barnier stressed that he wants to hear a  precise negotiating position  when he meets his british counterpart on monday. similarly, he repeated the eu position on refusing talks on what happens after brexit in march 2019 until britain makes  significant progress  in agreeing its divorce terms.  may for the first time spelled out her request for a transition period of about two years after brexit, during which britain would stay in the eu s single market. barnier reiterated that the other 27 could consider the request but again insisted that britain could not keep all the benefits of eu membership while relinquishing obligations. may s allies in brussels talked up the significance of a speech she chose to deliver in florence to drive home a message of future cooperation with britain s european neighbours.  we can only hope that the eu takes what the prime minister has said seriously, and sees that it is time to move forward,  said the pro brexit leader of her conservative party s group in the european parliament, syed kamall.  i hope that the clarity provided today will allow for real progress at the next round of negotiations.  however, comments by the german leader of the centre right group in the eu legislature, an ally of chancellor angela merkel, demonstrated the scepticism felt toward britain by some of europe s main powers:  in substance, may is bringing no more clarity to london s positions. i am even more concerned now.  guy verhofstadt, the brexit coordinator for the european parliament which must ratify any treaty, called may s speech  more realistic  but warned against  cherry picking  eu favours during the transition. his demand that britain forgo controls on eu immigration during any transition and go on making budget payments beyond 2020 will jar with may s pro brexit supporters. nonetheless, one senior official handling brexit for an eu government said two phrases from may on expatriates  rights and britain s financial obligations marked  a real step forward .   that is quite something,  the official said.  let s see what that means in the concrete negotiations.  those two elements are among three in which progress toward a deal is a criterion for eu leaders to approve the opening of talks on future trade terms. the third, the new eu uk land border on ireland, remains a conundrum and may said nothing new. another senior official handling brexit for a big member state said may s speech should help create a  more positive atmosphere  in the negotiations, when brexit secretary david davis arrives in brussels on monday for a new week of talks. may will meet the other 27 leaders in estonia on thursday and friday and hopes they could authorise barnier to launch trade talks as early as an oct. 19 20 summit in brussels.  the real problematic issue that remains to be resolved is the financial settlement,  said konrad szymanski, the eu affairs minister of poland, a major beneficiary of eu subsidies that could be hard hit by the loss of britain s annual contributions. may said other states should not  pay more or receive less over the remainder of the current budget plan . barnier said he was  ready to discuss the concrete implications of this pledge .  the european commission has estimated that britain might owe something like 60 billion euros ($70 billion) on leaving in march 2019. about a third of that, eu officials say, would be down to making britain pay its roughly 10 billion euro annual contribution for the remaining two years   2019 and 2020   of the eu s current, seven year budget programme. however, were britain to remain in the single market, which would entail payments into eu programmes, that money   some 20 billion euros   would no longer come under the  divorce bill .  britain has argued that it will owe very little on leaving, countering eu demands that it go on paying for many years after brexit to cover much longer term commitments previously made. an eu official told reuters:  what may said goes further than what the british government has said so far. but ... it is not clear until when they would be willing to pay.

" the international atomic energy agency, the u.n. global nuclear watchdog, opened a uranium bank in kazakhstan on tuesday, a $150 million facility designed to discourage new nations from enriching the nuclear fuel. the low enriched uranium (leu) bank in the city of oskemen, in eastern kazakhstan, will store up to 90 tonnes of the fuel, enough to power a large city for three years, and sell it to iaea members if they are unable to procure it elsewhere.   the leu bank will serve as a last resort mechanism to provide confidence to countries that they will be able to obtain leu for the manufacture of fuel for nuclear power plants in the event of an unforeseen, non commercial disruption to their supplies,  iaea director general yukiya amano said in a statement on monday. countries such as iran have said they need enrichment facilities to ensure a steady supply of fuel for nuclear power plants, and the idea behind the bank is to make such supply available without domestic enrichment. russia has operated a similar bank since 2010 but the one in kazakhstan will be the first one fully owned and operated by the global nuclear watchdog.  by hosting the iaea leu bank, kazakhstan has made another contribution to strengthening the global non proliferation regime,  kazakh president nursultan nazarbayev said as he handed amano a symbolical key to the facility at a ceremony in the kazakh capital, astana.  i am confident that the iaea leu bank will make a valuable contribution to international efforts to ensure the availability of fuel for nuclear power plants,  amano said. the iaea said in a statement it would begin buying uranium soon, with the aim to ship it to the bank next year. the project was funded by donors, including the united states, the european union, kuwait, the united arab emirates, norway and the nuclear threat initiative.

" germany is best suited to host a new nato military logistics command, the top u.s. army general in europe said on tuesday. nato allies this month backed plans for two new military headquarters   an atlantic command and a logistics command   to help protect europe in the event of a future conflict. lieutenant general ben hodges told the berlin security conference that germany   already host to many u.s. troops   was well placed to take on the logistics role given its geographical location in the heart of europe, and its existing capabilities.  i can t imagine any other country being better suited than germany to take on that responsibility, from a geographical standpoint, a capability standpoint,  hodges said. diplomats have said that germany is eager to host the logistics command but no decisions have been made. hodges, who is due to retire next month, has repeatedly pushed for increased focus on improving the ability to move troops and equipment across europe in the event of a future conflict. nato began beefing up its defenses after the 2014 annexation by russia of ukraine s crimea peninsula, deploying troops to the baltic states and poland, strengthening its presence in the black sea and starting to modernizing its forces. the kremlin, which denies harboring any aggressive intentions toward europe, has condemned the moves as an attempt to encircle russia.

" the u.s. senate advanced the nomination of former exxon mobil corp (xom.n) chief executive rex tillerson on monday to be president donald trump’s secretary of state, moving closer to filling a key seat on the republican’s national security team despite partisan rancor over trump’s immigration order. the vote was 56 to 43 to move toward a final confirmation vote after up to 30 hours’ debate, putting a final vote very early on wednesday, if senators do not agree to change the time. the vote broke largely along party lines. every republican favored advancing the nomination and all but four members of the democratic caucus voted against it. the senate’s democratic leader, chuck schumer, and several other members of the party tried, but failed, to delay considering tillerson because of trump’s executive order banning immigration from seven mostly muslim countries and temporarily halting the entry of refugees. they said they wanted to question tillerson more closely on his views on muslim immigration. during his confirmation hearing, the former oil executive said he did not support a “blanket type rejection” of any group of people. democrats said that statement seemed to contradict trump’s order. trump and his supporters, including many republicans, said his order is necessary to keep americans safe and is not intended to ban muslims, despite addressing only muslim majority nations whose citizens have not been involved in attacks on the united states. they said it was important to fill important slots on trump’s national security team quickly. “as we proceed in ensuring the new administration has the leaders it needs to implement our nation’s foreign policy going forward, i have great confidence rex tillerson will serve the united states well,” senator bob corker, the republican chairman of the senate foreign relations committee, said.

" saudi led coalition aircraft struck a military police camp in the houthi controlled yemeni capital sanaa on wednesday, killing at least 39 people and wounding 90 more, including some prisoners, an official and witnesses said. the strike is part of an air campaign by the western backed coalition on the iran allied houthis that has escalated since the houthis crushed an uprising last week led by former yemeni president ali abdullah saleh and killed him. one official in the camp said the coalition aircraft had launched seven raids on the camp, located in the eastern part of sanaa, where some 180 prisoners were being held. the official said rescue teams had pulled out 35 bodies from the rubble, while the rest were not accounted for. it was the latest in a string of air raids the coalition has conducted on sanaa and other parts of the country, sometimes causing multiple casualties among civilians. a spokesman for the saudi led coalition could not immediately be reached for comment on the report. the coalition denies that it targets civilians. the united states and britain provide political backing as well as weapons and logistical support for the saudi led coalition, which has been fighting since 2015 to restore yemen s internationally recognised president, abd rabbu mansour hadi, to power.

" donald trump once described jamie dimon as “the worst banker in the united states,” but the president elect has helped make the boss of jpmorgan chase & co (jpm.n) $50 million richer. dimon is the top beneficiary among the 30 chief executives who run companies in the dow jones industrial average index from a stock rally inspired by trump’s election, according to a reuters analysis of their option grants.  trump’s proposed policies for lower taxes, less wall street regulation and more infrastructure spending have energized the u.s. stock market since the real estate magnate’s nov. 8 victory.  the post election rally even resurrected the value of an option award held by goldman sachs group inc (gs.n) ceo lloyd blankfein that was worthless on the eve of the election.  dimon, a lifelong democrat, has seen his stock options surge in value by more than $50 million to $146 million since the republican candidate’s white house win.  trump criticized dimon in 2013 for reaching a $13 billion settlement with the u.s. government over the sale of toxic mortgages instead of fighting the case. nevertheless, he appointed dimon to the president’s strategic and policy forum, a group of high profile business leaders he set up last month to advise him on economic growth and job creation.  dimon declined to comment on trump’s criticism or the rise in value of his holdings. stock options held by dow 30 ceos surged in value by 23 percent to about $1 billion in 2016, with most of the gain coming after trump’s election win.  the figures reflect outstanding stock options that could be exercised at the end of 2015. options that expired or vested in 2016 were excluded from the analysis.  in a few cases, ceos exercised some of those options during 2016, u.s. regulatory filings show. visa inc (v.n) ceo charles scharf did not need a trump led stock rally to hit the jackpot. about two weeks before the election, he exercised nearly 800,000 options for gross proceeds of almost $33 million, u.s. regulatory filings show. he resigned from visa effective dec. 1. for a look at how the post election rally has affected dow 30 stock options, click here (tmsnrt.rs/2icbvvt)     trump campaigned on the slogan “make america great again,” vowing to bolster the prospects of the american working class by preventing jobs from moving abroad, restricting immigration and renegotiating trade pacts. in 2015, trump called high salaries paid to ceos a “joke” and a “disgrace” and said these were often approved by company boards stacked with ceos’ friends. pro business agenda to be sure, trump’s election has helped investors big and small. hopes of a pro business agenda have driven the dow 30 close to 20,000   a level it has never breached   in a boon for workers’ retirement plans. “with the recent trump/republican win, it appears that investors are getting more excited about potential growth and animal spirits are on the rise,” top investment strategists at morgan stanley said this month in a wealth management report. “this is likely to lead to the final euphoric stage of this cyclical bull market which could be quite powerful in 2017’s first half.”    big stock option gains for goldman sachs head blankfein, american express co (axp.n) ceo kenneth chenault and jp morgan’s dimon may be a surprise, given that their companies have reduced or even eliminated option grants in recent years in favor of stock awards tied to hitting financial targets. blankfein’s 322,104 outstanding options, granted in 2007 with a $204.16 strike price, were under water by $7.3 million on the eve of the presidential election. but by the end of 2016, their value had soared to $11.4 million. that was an $18.7 million swing, thanks to the trump inspired stock market rally and the u.s. federal reserve’s decision to increase interest rates, a boost for banks and credit card companies. blankfein declined to comment. alan johnson, managing director of pay consulting firm johnson associates in new york, said the big gains for the leaders of american express, goldman sachs and jpmorgan reflect how stock option compensation can magnify gains in a company’s share price. “when the stock goes up, with options, you get more leverage,” he said. critics of stock options say the grants can produce large amounts of wealth for ceos even with mediocre performance. one reason is that grants often are not linked to any financial performance metric, such as return on equity. and so as the united states nears the eighth year of a bull market, options can increase in value even if the ceos are running companies whose share price has lagged broad benchmarks during their tenure. for example, shares of caterpillar inc (cat.n) rose 54 percent during douglas oberhelman’s tenure as ceo of the big equipment maker from mid 2010 to the end of 2016, while the dow 30 more than doubled during that span.  but the value of oberhelman’s options rallied during his last year as ceo, climbing to $20.3 million after being under water by nearly $9 million at the start of 2016. the options’ value got a $10.6 million booster shot after trump’s victory. caterpillar shares rose 36 percent in 2016, making it one of the best performing stocks on the dow. trump has said he would use caterpillar tractors to build a wall between the united states and mexico. caterpillar and oberhelman declined to comment. not all ceos have been winners, however. coca cola co (ko.n) ceo muhtar kent, who contributed $2,700 to hillary clinton, trump’s democratic rival for president, saw the value of his options decline by $11.3 million to $143 million.  coca cola shares are off 3 percent since trump was elected amid lingering concerns about consumers cutting their consumption of sugary drinks. a coca cola spokesman declined to comment.

" warren buffett bemoaned the “negative drumbeat” on the u.s. economy from presidential candidates in his annual berkshire hathaway inc shareholder letter on saturday, saying they are misleading americans into believing their children will be worse off than they are. “it’s an election year, and candidates can’t stop speaking about our country’s problems (which, of course, only they can solve),” buffett wrote, italicizing “they” for emphasis. as a result of their dour outlook on the u.s. economy, many americans now believe that their children will not live as prosperously as they themselves do, the 85 year old buffett said. “that view is dead wrong: the babies being born in america today are the luckiest crop in history,” buffett said. buffett did not single out any presidential candidates by name. the billionaire in december officially threw his backing behind hillary clinton, a democrat. “during presidential elections where no incumbent is running, both sides who are running for president always say they are the ones to solve the nation’s problems and point out what those problems are,” said bill smead, who invests $2.1 billion at smead capital management in seattle. republican presidential candidate donald trump, who won new jersey gov. chris christie’s endorsement on friday, has offered  a bleak assessment of the u.s. economy, repeatedly saying it is in a “bubble” that he hopes will pop before he takes office. “i don’t want to inherit all this stuff,” he has said. in his letter, buffett said “some commentators bemoan our current 2 percent per year growth” in real gross domestic product, “and, yes, we would all like to see a higher rate.” but he said america’s population is growing about 0.8 percent per year, and that 2 percent gdp growth equates to a 1.2 percent per capita growth rate. “that may not sound impressive,” buffett said. “but in a single generation of, say, 25 years, that rate of growth leads to a gain of 34.4 percent in real gdp per capita.” buffett, whose home in omaha, nebraska sits on less than an acre, said society has advanced significantly since he grew up during and after the great depression. “all families in my upper middle class neighborhood regularly enjoy a living standard better than that achieved by john d. rockefeller sr. at the time of my birth,” he said. “his unparalleled fortune couldn’t buy what we now take for granted, whether the field is – to name just a few – transportation, entertainment, communication or medical services. rockefeller certainly had power and fame; he could not, however, live as well as my neighbors now do.” all told, buffett said it is not a good idea to listen to these presidential candidates’ negative outlooks.  “for 240 years it’s been a terrible mistake to bet against america, and now is no time to start,” he said. “america’s golden goose of commerce and innovation will continue to lay more and larger eggs. america’s social security promises will be honored and perhaps made more generous. and, yes, america’s kids will live far better than their parents did.”  (reporting by jennifer ablan and jonathan stempel; editing by nick zieminski) this article was funded in part by sap. it was independently created by the reuters editorial staff. sap had no editorial involvement in its creation or production.",0
" special counsel robert mueller has issued grand jury subpoenas seeking testimony from public relations executives who worked on an international campaign organized by former trump campaign adviser paul manafort, nbc news reported on friday, citing people familiar with the matter. this is the first indication that mueller, who is investigating possible collusion between president donald trump’s campaign team and russia, is beginning to compel witness testimony before the grand jury, nbc said. russia’s government has denied interfering in the election and the president has denied collusion took place. one executive whose firm received a subpoena told nbc mueller’s team is looking at the lobbying campaign, which ran from 2012 to 2014. some of the firms involved in the campaign received subpoenas for documents weeks ago, and mueller’s team is now seeking testimony, nbc quoted him as saying. manafort, whose virginia apartment was raided by fbi agents last month, is a key figure in the mueller probe. the longtime political consultant and lobbyist is being investigated for possible money laundering and has been targeted as someone who might testify against former colleagues, two people familiar with mueller’s work have said.

" president donald trump said on friday that he was disappointed that a conservative faction in the house of representatives blocked his healthcare legislation and said “we learned a lot about loyalty” from the effort. speaking in the oval office after a stunning political setback, trump said the healthcare effort was a victim of stalwart democratic opposition and any future healthcare legislation would likely need democratic support. he also said he was surprised and disappointed by the opposition from the house freedom caucus, a group of conservatives who prevented republicans from using their majority in the house to pass the legislation. asked if he felt betrayed by the freedom caucus, trump said he did not. “no, i’m not betrayed. they’re friends of mine. i’m disappointed because we could have had it. so i’m disappointed. i’m a little surprised, to be honest with you,” trump said. “we really had it. it was pretty much there, within grasp. but i’ll tell you what’s going to come of it is a better bill...because there were things in this bill that i didn’t particularly like. if both parties could get together and do real healthcare, that’s the best thing,” he said. trump, a new york businessman who won election nov. 8 based in part on promises to get big deals through congress, cast the failure as a learning experience. “we all learned a lot. we learned a lot about loyalty,” trump said. “we learned a lot about some very arcane rules in obviously both the senate and the house.” trump also expressed confidence in house speaker paul ryan, who was seen as the main backer of the legislation. ryan personally delivered the news earlier in the day to trump that there were not enough votes to pass it. “i like speaker ryan. he worked very, very hard. a lot of different groups. he’s got a lot of factions. and there’s been a long history of liking and disliking, even within the republican party, long before i got here,” he said. “i’m not going to speak badly about anybody within the party.” trump has privately told confidants he wished he had done tax reform first instead of getting immersed in the difficult effort to overhaul president barack obama’s signature healthcare law, which passed without republican support in 2010. “we’ll probably be going right now for tax reform,” trump said, saying he wanted “big tax cuts and tax reform. that will be next.” ",0
" china wants closer ties with myanmar s military to help protect regional peace and security, a senior chinese general told the visiting head of the southeast asian country s army. china and myanmar have had close diplomatic and economic ties for years, including increasingly in the strategically important oil and gas sectors, and china has offered its support to its southern neighbor, also known as burma, throughout a crisis over its treatment of its rohingya muslim minority. more than 600,000 rohingya have fled from buddhist majority myanmar s rakhine state, most to neighboring bangladesh, since a myanmar military crackdown in response to attacks on the security forces by rohingya insurgents in august. the united states on wednesday for the first time called the myanmar military operation against the rohingya  ethnic cleansing  and threatened targeted sanctions against those responsible for  horrendous atrocities . meeting in beijing, li zuocheng, who sits on china s central military commission, which runs its armed forces, told senior general min aung hlaing that china s development and prosperity were an important opportunity for myanmar s development, china s defense ministry said in a statement.  in the face of a complex and changeable regional security situation, china is willing to maintain strategic communication between the two countries  militaries,  li was cited as saying in the statement issued late on wednesday. china wanted greater contacts between the two armed forces and deeper training and technical exchanges and to promote border defense cooperation to ensure peace and stability along their common border, li added. china has been angered by fighting between myanmar s military and autonomy seeking ethnic minority rebels close to the chinese border in recent years, which has at times forced thousands of villagers to flee into china. the chinese ministry made no direct mention of the rohingya issue in the statement. china built close ties with myanmar s generals during years of military rule, when western countries imposed sanctions on myanmar for its suppression of the democracy movement. more recently, their ties have included oil and gas as myanmar pumps natural gas from the bay of bengal to china. a new oil pipeline, opened this year, also feeds middle east crude through myanmar to a new refinery in yunnan, southwest china. this has opened a new oil supply route to china, avoiding the strait of malacca and singapore. the united states and other western countries have stepped up engagement with myanmar since the military began handing power to civilians in 2011, and especially since former democracy leader aung san suu kyi won a 2015 election. but an international outcry over myanmar s violations of the rights of the rohingya has raised questions in western countries about that engagement. rights group amnesty international has called for a comprehensive arms embargo against myanmar as well as targeted financial sanctions against senior myanmar military officials. china s defense ministry cited min aung hlaing as thanking china for its support in helping myanmar ensure domestic stability.

" u.s. defense secretary jim mattis said on tuesday the united states should consider staying in the iran nuclear deal unless it were proven that tehran was not abiding by the agreement or that it was not in the u.s. national interest to do so. although mattis said he supported president donald trump s review of the agreement curbing iran s nuclear program, the defense secretary s view was far more positive than that of trump, who has called the deal agreed between iran and six world powers in 2015 an  embarrassment.  trump is weighing whether the pact serves u.s. security interests as he faces an oct. 15 deadline for certifying that iran is complying, a decision that could sink an agreement strongly supported by the other world powers that negotiated it.  if we can confirm that iran is living by the agreement, if we can determine that this is in our best interest, then clearly we should stay with it,  mattis told a senate hearing.  i believe ..., absent indications to the contrary, it is something that the president should consider staying with,  mattis added. earlier, when mattis was asked whether he thought staying in the deal was in the u.s. national security interest, he replied:  yes, senator, i do.  the white house had no immediate comment on mattis  remarks, which once again highlighted the range of views on major policy issues within the trump administration. if trump does not recertify by oct. 15 that iran is in compliance, congressional leaders would have 60 days to decide whether to reimpose sanctions on tehran suspended under the accord. that would let congress, controlled by trump s fellow republicans, effectively decide whether to kill the deal. although congressional leaders have declined to say whether they would seek to reimpose sanctions, republican lawmakers were united in their opposition to the agreement reached by democratic former president barack obama. senator tom cotton, a long time skeptic about the iran deal, backed decertification in order to threaten iran with more sanctions or military action.  one thing i learned in the army is that when you have your opponent on his knees, you drive him to the ground and choke him out,  cotton said in a speech on tuesday to the council on foreign relations in washington. in a house of representatives hearing on tuesday, mattis said iran was  fundamentally  in compliance with the nuclear deal.  there have been certainly some areas where they were not temporarily in that regard, but overall our intelligence community believes that they have been compliant and the iaea (international atomic energy agency) also says so,  mattis said. last month, iran s president hassan rouhani said the accord cannot be renegotiated. trump has said he has made a decision on what to do about the agreement but has not said what he has decided. the prospect of washington reneging on the agreement has worried some u.s. partners that helped negotiate it, especially as the world grapples with north korea s nuclear and ballistic missile development. backers of the pact say its collapse could trigger a regional arms race, worsen middle east tensions and discourage countries like north korea from trusting washington to keep its word.  the deal was signed by britain, china, the european union, france, germany, iran, russia and the united states. white house national security adviser h.r. mcmaster has defended trump s criticism of the nuclear agreement, saying it had the  fatal flaw  of a  sunset clause,  under which some restrictions on iran s nuclear program expire from 2025. european ambassadors speaking in washington last week said they would do everything possible to protect companies based in europe and that continue to do business with iran from reimposed u.s. sanctions. french ambassador gerard araud noted that the other countries that signed the pact had made clear they do not support renegotiating it. j street, a liberal pro israel group, said trump did not have legitimate grounds to decertify the deal.  if he chooses to do so anyway, he will be acting purely based on divisive politics and dangerous ideology, and endangering the security of the u.s. and our allies,  dylan williams, vice president of government affairs for the group, said in a statement.

" lebanon could face economic sanctions from arab countries or worse if hezbollah does not stop meddling in regional conflicts, a lebanese sunni politician said on friday.  former justice minister ashraf rifi, who rose to prominence with vocal opposition to shi ite hezbollah, is closely aligned to the saudi position in lebanon and more hawkish than long established sunni leaders.   we can expect economic repercussions. at the political level too, at the level of our lebanese arab relations. and it s open to all the possibilities, unfortunately,  he said. his comments to reuters echo recent statements by saad al hariri, who quit abruptly as lebanese prime minister in a broadcast from saudi arabia two weeks ago.     the shock resignation thrust lebanon into a regional rivalry between riyadh and its allies against an iranian bloc, which includes the hezbollah militant group and political party.     rifi said he has been in touch with saudi officials recently over lebanon s crisis and is familiar with riyadh s thinking.       a political rival of hariri, rifi defeated a hariri backed list in local elections in the mostly sunni city of tripoli last year, though he lacks the premier s country wide standing.   today, lebanese officials have a big responsibility. all the lebanese officials have to be careful about good relations with the arab world,  rifi told reuters.  there is no more leniency towards hezbollah...using its illegitimate arsenal  in middle east conflicts.   lebanon s heavily armed hezbollah, a part of the political fabric, wields great influence in the country. it also has sent thousands of fighters into syria to battle alongside the damascus government against mostly sunni rebels and militants.  lebanese politicians and bankers have said they fear saudi arabia corralling arab allies to economically blockade lebanon as they did with qatar.      lebanon cannot live without the arab countries,  rifi said.  we know how many lebanese work in saudi arabia or in the gulf and how much revenue they bring...to the lebanese economy.       up to 400,000 lebanese work in the gulf, and remittances flowing into the country are a vital source of cash to keep its economy afloat and the heavily indebted government functioning. political sources have said that potential sanctions include a ban on flights, visas, exports and transfer of remittances.    saudi arabia and its arab allies have now drawn a line in the sand, rifi said.  that there is no place for (hezbollah) in (lebanon s) future government, if it keeps choosing to be a security and military arm for iran.  the lebanese state will have to distance itself in  a real and practical  way from regional wars  so that we don t bear the repercussions of hezbollah s acts,  he added.  in his resignation speech, hariri said he feared assassination, railing against iran and hezbollah. a sunni muslim leader and long time saudi ally, hariri has yet to return to beirut. in his public comments after quitting, hariri warned of possible arab sanctions and a danger to the livelihoods of lebanese in the gulf. hezbollah must stop intervening in regional conflicts, particularly yemen, he said.   lebanon s president michel aoun has called hariri a saudi hostage, refusing to accept his resignation unless he returns to beirut, and stressing that the government still stands. saudi arabia and hariri say he is a free man. hariri became prime minister last year in a power sharing deal that made aoun, a hezbollah political ally, president and his coalition government includes hezbollah.  rifi criticized aoun s stance, as well as other lebanese accusations that riyadh forced hariri to quit, as  surprising and unprecedented.  he considered hariri s resignation constitutional and said lebanon would have to form a new,  more balanced  government in the near future.  rifi, a former police chief, resigned as justice minister in 2016 in protest at what he described as hezbollah s dominant role. he had also heaped criticism on hariri for nominating another hezbollah ally to fill the vacant presidency.  from the moment the prime minister uttered his desire to quit, the government became a resigned one,  he said.",0

" chile s stock market has priced in a victory of conservative presidential candidate sebastian pinera, even though progressive candidates could form an alliance in a december runoff, traders and analysts said. the ipsa stock market index has surged 27 percent this year and is on track for its best year since 2010, spurred by a rebound in prices of top export copper and polls that have shown pinera ahead in the race. pinera, a wealthy businessman and supporter of free market policies, is expected to come in first by a wide margin in november s first round vote, but he is unlikely to win an absolute majority. that would result in a close runoff against the leading progressive candidate.  the majority is left of center,  said kenneth bunker, a political scientist at universidad central de chile.  a pinera victory depends on division within the left.  the most recent gfk adimark poll shows pinera, who has consolidated the support of the country s political right, leading at 34 percent of the vote. center left senator alejandro guillier is second with 16 percent, well ahead of several candidates promising to continue president michelle bachelet s socially progressive policies. hard left candidate beatriz sanchez, who has proposed billions of dollars in new taxes on mining companies, was third at 15 percent. as campaigning officially began last week, guillier appealed for unity, saying in a radio interview that he would share his policy platform with rivals on the left to try to align their positions.  no one doubts that in the second round we will all be together,  guillier said at a rally. while chile remains one of latin america s most business friendly countries, public debt has grown as falling copper prices hit government revenue, and bachelet critics say she has not prioritized growth. last month, her top economic officials resigned in part over the government s rejection of a $2.5 billion copper and iron project on environmental grounds. investors are particularly attentive to candidates  proposals related to mining, chile s most important industry. guillier and pinera have both pledged to streamline the mine permitting process, though guillier has suggested modifying free trade accords to promote domestic mineral processing. in a banner year for emerging markets, the ipsa has outpaced most regional peers. brazil s bovespa index has surged 24 percent, peru s leading index is up 20 percent, and colombia s colcap index is up 9 percent. only argentina s merval, up 49 percent, has surged more.  the industrial and raw materials sectors have led chile s market gains, surging 55 and 41 percent year to date, respectively. lithium miner sociedad quimica y minera de chile sa has risen 77 percent in the past 9 months, while shipping firm compania sud americana de vapores sa is up 97 percent. in recent client notes, credit suisse and j.p. morgan have said the so called  pinera effect  has passed and that now might be the time for traders to take profits or wait for election results. hugo rubio, president of brokerage btg pactual chile, said a pinera loss would cause a double digit drop in the stock market, though the full extent would depend on the candidate.   it s a risk the markets don t seem to be alive to at this stage,  said edward glossop, emerging markets economist at capital economics in london.  the risks are to the downside.

"watch president trump hammer senator mccain and the  weak  senator flake at an arizona rally, where he also threw his support behind dr. kelli ward:ap  arizona republican sen. jeff flake s re-election race is becoming a case study in the gop s convulsions among the establishment, a furious base, and angry donors.after bucking donald trump in a state the president won, flake is bottoming out in polls. yet republicans look like they may be stuck with a hard-core conservative challenger who some fear could win the primary but lose in the general election.a white house search for a candidate to replace former state sen. kelli ward in the primary appears to have hit a wall. and now conservatives want to turn arizona into the latest example of a trump train outsider taking down a member of the gop establishment. people are fooling themselves if they think jeff flake is anything but a walking dead member of the united state senate,  said andy surabian, whose great america alliance is backing ward. i don t see how he survives a primary. i don t see how he survives a general. the numbers just don t add up,  added surabian, who worked at the white house as an adviser to steve bannon, then the president s top strategist.despite discontent among some republicans over ward, bannon met with her last week at a conservative conference in colorado springs to encourage her campaign, according to a republican official who spoke on condition of anonymity to disclose the previously unreported private meeting.ward unsuccessfully challenged arizona s senior senator, john mccain, in last year s election, losing in the primary by a wide margin. but in flake, she would face a more vulnerable candidate at a moment when the gop establishment is on the defensive, facing a simmering anti-incumbent mood heightened by republicans  failure to make good on seven years of promises to scrap barack obama s health care law.flake is in danger of becoming the latest victim of this voter wrath. yet rather than making an effort to soothe pro-trump gop voters, he s all but dared them to take him down by kicking off his campaign with an anti-trump manifesto,  conscience of a conservative,  a book in which he bemoaned his party s failure to stand up to trump in last year s presidential race. we pretended that the emperor wasn t naked,  flake wrote.trump, in turn, has lashed out at flake on twitter, calling him  toxic,  while praising ward. white house officials say there s little chance trump will have a change of heart over supporting flake. one official, speaking on condition of anonymity to disclose private deliberations, said trump is irritated not only by flake s public criticism but by what trump sees as the senator s attempts to use his critiques of the president to gain attention.nevertheless, flake, 54, insists he won t be getting out of the race. the primary is aug. 29.

" former california democratic state senator leland yee received a five year prison sentence on wednesday for conspiracy in a corruption case that involved bribery, weapons trafficking and money laundering, federal prosecutors said. lee, 67, pleaded guilty to the conspiracy charge after his arrest in 2014 in a sweep that included suspected leaders of organized crime in san francisco, the city he represented in the state legislature. prosecutors had sought an eight year sentence for yee, whose guilty plea in federal court in san francisco last july marked the end of a long political career that included two terms on the san francisco board of supervisors, as well as election to the california assembly and senate. yee was the third california state senator charged in 2014 in separate criminal cases. all three eventually left office, costing the democrats a key two thirds legislative majority.

" puerto rico’s governor said on saturday he has delivered a revised fiscal turnaround plan to the u.s. territory’s financial oversight board that includes $262 million in additional revenue and changes to healthcare funding.  governor ricardo rossello’s initial plan, presented on feb. 28, was rejected by the board, which said it relied on overly optimistic baseline revenue and economic growth forecasts. the board must approve a turnaround blueprint for the island under the federal puerto rico rescue law known as promesa. it has said it plans to do by march 15.  francisco cimadevilla, a spokesman for the board, said the seven member panel is still evaluating the new proposal and will not have any comment before a public hearing in new york on monday.  rossello’s office issued a statement on saturday announcing the revamped plan, but gave little detail. it said the plan would continue to try to protect puerto rico’s most vulnerable citizens. “our administration’s plan remains the same: to avoid affecting the most vulnerable and to operate a fiscally responsible government,” rossello said in the statement.  puerto rico, plagued by a 45 percent poverty rate and shrinking population, is trying to restructure $70 billion in debt. the fiscal plan will serve as the baseline for restructuring talks with wide ranging bondholder groups.  rossello’s earlier draft set aside $1.2 billion a year to service debt, just 30 percent of what it owes next fiscal year. it proposed cuts to healthcare spending and pension benefits, and projected creating $33.8 billion over 10 years through myriad spending cuts and $12.9 billion in new revenue. the board on thursday announced it would not approve rossello’s plan as constructed, saying it used “overly optimistic” forecasts for economic growth rates and for a return to nominal economic growth. it also said the projections failed “to reflect near certain declines in baseline revenues associated with corporate taxes and non resident withholding taxes.” ",0

" after the crushing electoral losses that swept donald trump into the white house and sealed republican control of the u.s. congress, the democrats’ road to recovery winds through the leafy, well heeled suburbs of north atlanta.  here, democrats are threatening a stunning special election upset that could signal how well the party can turn trump’s low approval ratings into political gains. and they appear to have an ally in the april 18 vote: trump himself.  in the most watched congressional race so far in the trump era, a wave of grassroots anti trump fervor has positioned democrat jon ossoff, a 30 year old political newcomer, to possibly capture a house of representatives seat held by republicans for decades, one of 24 seats democrats need nationwide to reclaim the house.  more from reuters: russian naval activity in europe exceeds cold war levels: u.s. admiraliran chides gulf arabsrussian computer programmer arrested in spain: embassy “the grassroots intensity here is electric, and it’s because folks are concerned that what is happening in washington doesn’t represent our values,” ossoff said in an interview. “this is a chance for this community to stand up and make a statement about what we believe.”  with democrats desperate for signs of hope after hillary clinton’s loss to trump, ossoff’s underdog “make trump furious” campaign has endeared him to national anti trump activists and pushed him well ahead of 17 rivals in polls. the documentary filmmaker and former congressional aide raised a jaw dropping $8.3 million in the first quarter, his campaign said.  “i’ve never seen the democrats around here so engaged, and it’s donald trump who got us so engaged,” said carolyn hadaway, 77, a veteran party activist and retired software engineer from marietta, a city of about 60,000 people in georgia’s central cobb county.  georgia would seem an unlikely venue for a democratic revival. trump won it by about 5 percentage points in november. and its voters backed republican nominees in eight of the last nine presidential contests, including the last six in a row.  but demographic changes are brewing. growing minority communities and transplants from other regions have made atlanta’s suburbs increasingly competitive for democrats. georgia’s sixth congressional district, the location for april’s special election, exemplifies changes common in booming southern cities like atlanta, charlotte and nashville.  the district is white collar, educated and doing well economically, with median household incomes of $80,000 versus $50,000 statewide, and nearly 60 percent of adults holding a college or professional degree, more than twice the statewide average. it is also increasingly diverse, and in recent years became a magnet for well educated immigrants from india and other parts of asia.  the district was about 80 percent white at the turn of the century. but since then, the black share of the population has grown from 10 percent to 13 percent, the hispanic share has doubled to 12.5 percent and asian representation doubled to more than 10 percent.  about a fifth of the district is now foreign born – twice the statewide average, according to census data.  though newer immigrants may not be eligible to vote, census data indicate more than 40 percent are naturalized citizens, potentially bringing a different set of views on issues like immigration to the table than the voters in this district who sent trump adviser and former speaker of the house newt gingrich to congress for 10 straight terms.  april’s special election fills the seat vacated by tom price, the new secretary of health and human services. it gives both parties a chance to test their messages for election battles next year in suburban districts where democrats need to make inroads and where trump’s populist economic message did not sell well in november.  while price sailed to re election with 62 percent of the vote, trump barely beat clinton in georgia’s sixth district by one percentage point. in 2012, republican mitt romney beat democratic president barack obama in the district by 23 points.  republican candidates nationwide will closely watch the result as they calculate whether to embrace the president.  the 11 republicans in the race have split between those who portray themselves as trump supporters and establishment candidates who keep a respectful and sometimes wary distance.  “i’m ready to support him,” former state senator dan moody, who was endorsed by u.s. senator david perdue, said of trump in an interview. but “i’m not going to jump over a cliff with him.”  grassroots democratic groups flood the district’s tidy suburban neighborhoods on the weekends, busing in volunteers from as far away as maryland to go door to door on ossoff’s behalf.  the ossoff momentum worries republicans, say party officials, and outside help has arrived. a super pac aligned with house republican leaders put more than $2 million into ads painting ossoff as too young and inexperienced.  ossoff played down the strategic value of a possible upset.  “the national implications here will be about how this affects the political calculus for folks in the republican conference in the house, not about how democrats are supposed to run in the midterms,” he said.  in a low turnout special election, getting supporters to the polls is vital, and democrats have voted early in greater numbers than republicans so far.  “we aren’t panicking, but there is concern,” said maggie holliman, a member of the republican state executive committee.  ossoff’s best chance is to win the april 18 vote, a “jungle primary” that features all 18 candidates from both parties on the same ballot. if no one reaches 50 percent, the top two vote getters square off on june 20.  republicans are confident they can win a one on one race with ossoff, as the party unites with organizational and financial help pouring into the republican majority district.  “there is a chance ossoff can win without a runoff, but that’s his only chance. he’s benefiting from unified democratic support and republicans being highly divided,” said georgia based republican strategist joel mcelhannon.  polls show ossoff hovering in the low 40s, not enough to avoid a runoff. the leading republican, former secretary of state karen handel, is well behind.  handel has been cautious in talking about trump. she said in an interview she expected to work with him on issues such as tax reform and border security, but “first and foremost” she would be a conservative advocate for her district.  by contrast republicans bob gray, a local business executive, and bruce levell, head of trump’s national diversity coalition, pledge undivided loyalty to the white house. gray said he was the republican in the race who performed the behind the scenes political groundwork for trump in the district.  levell pulled out his cellphone and showed a reporter text messages from trump aides kellyanne conway, sarah huckabee sanders and even trump son in law jared kushner to prove his insider status with the white house.  “if people are looking for someone to help trump, i’m their guy,” he said.

" yemen s cholera epidemic has reached one million suspected cases, the international committee of the red cross said on thursday, with war leaving more than 80 percent of the population short of food, fuel, clean water and access to healthcare. yemen, one of the arab world s poorest countries, is embroiled in a proxy war between the houthi armed movement, allied with iran, and a u.s. backed military coalition headed by saudi arabia. the united nations says yemen is suffering the world s worst humanitarian crisis, and eight million people are on the brink of famine.  the cholera figure is almost certainly exaggerated, but that does not diminish the scale and complexity of the humanitarian crisis, said marc poncin, yemen emergency coordinator for aid agency m decins sans fronti res. cholera flared up in april and spread rapidly, killing 2,227 people. the death rate has fallen dramatically, and without laboratory confirmation, recent cases are probably diarrhea, poncin said. a new wave of cholera is expected in march or april.  it s probably unavoidable. we need to be ready to face another big epidemic,  said poncin, adding that cholera may become a long term burden as it has in haiti.  the places where the war is active are the ones most at risk for increase of disease.  the latest emergency is diphtheria, a disease not seen in yemen for 25 years, which has affected 312 people and killed 35. it has not spread explosively, as cholera did, but diphtheria outbreaks can affect many thousands, and there is a global shortage of diphtheria anti toxin. yemen has enough for 200 500 patients, poncin said.  an urgent diphtheria vaccination campaign early in 2018 will complicate the who s hope of doing mass cholera vaccination at the same time, especially given the problems with security and accessing remote areas, poncin said. the houthis, who control much of the country, are also suspicious of vaccination drives, he added.  yemen s troubles have been aggravated by the saudi led coalition s blockade of its ports, which has caused a fuel shortage and a spike in food prices. the health system has virtually collapsed, with health workers unpaid for a year, although the who gives incentive payments for cholera work.  the ports were closed in retaliation for a missile fired from yemen by the houthis. on wednesday, despite a fresh missile attack on riyadh, saudi arabia said it would allow the houthi controled port of hodeidah, vital for aid, to stay open for a month.

" north korean workers are operating in the kaesong industrial zone, state run web sites said on friday, after the joint venture with south korea was suspended last year amid disagreement over the north s nuclear and missile programmes. the south ended more than a decade of cooperation at the factory park on the north korean side of the demilitarized zone (dmz) after the north launched a rocket that put an object into orbit, closing the last remaining window of interaction between the two sides.  at the time, south korea said it would no longer allow funds paid for kaesong to be used in the north s missile and nuclear programmes. since then, a south korean official has said there is no evidence that north korea diverted wages paid to its workers by south korean companies operating in the park to its weapons programmes.  they do not even see our proud workers labouring vigorously working in the kaesong industrial complex,  north korea s propaganda web site meari (arirangmeari.com) said in a post dated friday.  another propaganda web site, uriminzokkiri, said  it is nobody s business what we do in an industrial complex where our nation s sovereignty is exercised .  u.s. funded broadcaster radio free asia reported on monday that north korean authorities were operating 19 clothing factories within the kaesong complex without informing south korean authorities, citing an unnamed source with knowledge of north korean matters in china.  an official at south korea s ministry of unification said north korea must not violate south korean firms  property rights within the complex, wire service yonhap reported.  the ministry could not be immediately reached for comment. reclusive north korea and the rich, democratic south are technically still at war because their 1950 53 conflict ended in a truce, not a peace treaty. in recent weeks, north korea has launched two missiles over japan and conducted its sixth nuclear test, and may be fast advancing toward its goal of developing a nuclear tipped missile capable of hitting the u.s. mainland. u.s. secretary of state rex tillerson said last weekend that washington was directly communicating with pyongyang on its nuclear and missile programmes but that pyongyang had shown no interest in dialogue. u.s. president donald trump later dismissed any prospect of talks with north korea as a waste of time.

" legislation that would grant u.s. privacy rights to europeans is being delayed in the u.s. senate, which may complicate negotiations over a broader trans atlantic data transfer pact that faces a january deadline for completion, sources said on wednesday. the judicial redress act, which would allow citizens of european allied countries to sue over data privacy in the united states, is “likely to be held” from a scheduled vote on thursday in the senate judiciary committee, a panel aide said.  passage of the legislation is viewed as an important step toward securing a new “safe harbor” framework after the previous one was struck down by a top european union court last year amid concerns about u.s. surveillance. more than 4,000 firms, including tech behemoths such as google and ibm, have been relying on the 15 year old safe harbor framework to freely transfer data between the united states and europe, which has far stricter rules on the privacy of personal information. but that deal was ruled invalid last october by the court of justice of the european union, which cited revelations about u.s. mass surveillance by former national security agency contractor edward snowden. european union data protection authorities have given brussels and washington until the end of january to strike a new safe harbor agreement for transferring personal data.  industry executives are growing increasingly alarmed that the new safe harbor agreement will not be completed in time. the information technology industry council, a washington based trade organization that represents apple, microsoft and other major tech companies, sent some of its executives to europe on wednesday to press for a quick resolution. a spokesman for the organization, which warned of “enormous” consequences in a letter this week to president barack obama and european commission president jean claude juncker if a pact is not forged soon, said its leaders are meeting with government and data protection authorities in several cities, including dublin, amsterdam, berlin and london, ahead of the deadline. eu privacy regulators are due to meet on feb. 2 to decide if they should begin enforcement action against companies if they determine all transfer mechanisms violate eu law and there is no new framework in place.

" senator john mccain suggested on thursday that the senate armed services committee, the powerful congressional panel he chairs, may consider issuing a subpoena to make the white house’s top cyber security official testify. white house cyber security coordinator rob joyce did not appear before the committee on thursday, as requested, to discuss cyber threats facing the united states. his vacant seat drew frustration from lawmakers in both parties. senator bill nelson, a democrat on the panel, urged mccain to consider a subpoena to compel joyce to appear. “i think that needs to be discussed in committee,” mccain said. in a statement, a white house spokesman said it has been “longstanding practice” of presidents of both parties to not make white house advisers available for congressional testimony. “this practice is rooted in the separation of powers and in the confidentiality interests of the executive branch,” the spokesman said. “officials from relevant departments and agencies are available to accommodate the committee’s legitimate oversight needs without violating the confidentiality interests that attach to white house staff.” mccain countered, however, that the absence was a “misinterpretation” of the president’s executive authority to have private counsel. several other senators expressed frustration at joyce’s absence.  “the empty chair is outrageous,” democratic senator claire mccaskill said. “i am disgusted there is not a representative here.” ",0
" in a telephone call, u.s. president elect donald trump told vietnam’s prime minister he wanted to further strengthen fast warming ties between the two countries, the government of the southeast asian nation said on thursday. vietnam has advanced ties with the united states to a new level under the obama administration as it faces down communist neighbor china’s challenge to its territorial claims in the busy waterway of the south china sea.    during wednesday’s conversation, vietnamese premier nguyen xuan phuc congratulated trump on his election win and stressed the importance of maintaining friendship and cooperation. “president elect trump spoke highly of the achievements of vietnam, as well as the positive developments in bilateral ties,” vietnam’s government said on its news website. “he also asserted his wish to cooperate with vietnam to accelerate the relationship between the two countries.” trump has had conversations with several leaders of countries locked in maritime disputes with china, among them japan, the philippines and taiwan. his trade platform runs counter to vietnam’s interests, however, with his opposition to a trans pacific partnership proving a major setback for southeast asia’s biggest exporter to the united states. trump and phuc discussed ways to promote economic ties, trade and investment, the government added. in a statement, trump’s transition team confirmed the conversation, saying the two men “discussed a range of shared interests and agreed to work together to continue strengthening the relationship between the two nations”. just days after trump’s win, phuc told parliament that ratification of the tpp would be shelved because of political changes in the united states, but vietnam still wanted good relations with washington.    in a separate development, a u.s. guided missile destroyer, the mustin, visited cam ranh international port on thursday in a routine technical stop, the u.s. embassy said.  the ship’s visit was “an example of the depth of our comprehensive partnership and the importance of strengthening our civilian and military ties,” said u.s. ambassador ted osius. vietnam has expressed support for the united states to maintain its security presence in asia. washington fully lifted a u.s. lethal arms embargo on vietnam in may, allowing closer defense links and some joint military exercises.

" moldova s pro russian president igor dodon has blocked government plans to send troops to ukraine to participate in military exercises starting this week and which coincide with russian drills across the border in belarus.  dodon s move on wednesday underscores divisions within the ex soviet nation, where the president is frequently at odds on foreign policy with the government, which favors closer ties with the european union and the united states.  the government had planned to send 57 servicemen to take part in exercises by mostly nato countries, including the united states and turkey, in western ukraine from sept. 8 23. russia will meanwhile hold drills from sept. 14 20 in western russia, belarus and russia s exclave of kaliningrad. moscow has dismissed fears in neighboring nations that the drills may be used as a precursor for an invasion. dodon exercised his presidential veto to block the decision, arguing moldova was bound by its constitution to stay neutral.   the participation of moldovan servicemen in military exercises outside the country is not acceptable,  dodon wrote on his facebook page. a ukrainian defense ministry spokesman said kiev had not been formally notified that moldova was withdrawing its personnel.  earlier this year dodon banned the participation of military personnel in nato exercises in romania, prompting complaints by the u.s. and romanian ambassadors in chisinau. speaking at a televised cabinet meeting, prime minister pavel filip said he was baffled by dodon s decision:  no one wants an unprepared and weak army.  moldova has been governed by pro western leaders since 2009 and signed a trade pact with the eu in 2014. russia retaliated by halting imports of moldovan farm produce, depriving the country of a key market for its wine, fruit and vegetables. relations suffered further this year due to a dispute in march over the treatment of moldovan officials traveling to or through russia, and the expulsion of russian diplomats in may. in august, moldova declared russian deputy prime minister dmitry rogozin persona non grata, accusing him of making defamatory remarks about moldovan government officials.

" china s cabinet on thursday passed new rules to regulate religion to bolster national security, fight extremism and restrict faith practiced outside organizations approved by the state. the document passed by premier li keqiang updates a version of rules put into place in 2005 to allow the regulation of religion to better reflect  profound  changes in china and the world, the official xinhua news agency reported. the rules released by xinhua use strong and specific language about the need to protect china s national security against threats from religious groups.  religious affairs maintenance should persist in a principle of maintaining legality, curbing illegality, blocking extremism, resisting infiltration and attacking crime,  the regulations say.      any group or individual must not create conflict or contention between different religions, with a single religion or between religious individuals and non religious individuals,  they say.     president xi jinping has emphasized the need to guard against foreign infiltration through religion and the need to prevent the spread to  extremist  ideology, while also being tolerant of traditional faiths that he sees as a salve to social ills.         the officially atheist ruling communist party says it protects freedom of religion, but it keeps a tight rein on religious activities and allows only officially recognized religious institutions to operate. the rules, which come into effect on feb 2, 2018, also place new oversight on online discussion of religious matters, on religious gatherings, the financing of religious groups and the construction of religious buildings, among others. they increase existing restrictions on unregistered religious groups to include explicit bans on teaching about religion or going abroad to take part in training or meetings. much of china s religious practice, which has seen a revival in recent decades despite being effectively banned in the 1960s during the cultural revolution, takes place in informal settings not recognized, though often tolerated, by the authorities. religious education is also further brought under the umbrella of the state in the regulations, with explicit provisions on the establishment and registration of religious colleges. new provisions are included on the use and raising of religious funds and on taxation. donations from foreign groups or individuals, for example, are banned, while donations over 100,000 yuan ($15,420) need to be reported to authorities. fines for breaking the rules have also been increased in the new version and the organizers of unapproved events can now be subject to fines from 100,000 to 300,000 yuan, rather than the previous 1 to 3 times the amount spent on the event.

" u.s. president donald trump said on wednesday he would not have appointed jeff sessions as attorney general if he had known sessions would recuse himself from the russia investigation, according to a new york times interview. “sessions should have never recused himself and if he was going to recuse himself he should have told me before he took the job and i would have picked somebody else,” the times quoted trump as saying. sessions recused himself in march from the probe into allegations of russia’s meddling in the 2016 u.s. presidential election and possible ties between russians and the trump campaign. he did so after failing to disclose at his confirmation hearing that he had held meetings last year with russia’s ambassador. a sessions spokesman declined a reuters request for comment.  there were media reports last month that sessions, a former u.s. senator who was an early supporter of trump’s campaign, had offered to resign because of tensions with trump over the recusal. trump also told the new york times that a conversation he had with russian president vladimir putin during a dinner at the group of 20 summit in germany earlier this month lasted about 15 minutes and was mostly about “pleasantries.” that conversation has sparked controversy because it was only disclosed on tuesday.  ian bremmer, the president of political risk consultancy eurasia group, has said the meeting lasted about an hour.

" south korean guards fired warning shots across the heavily militarized border with north korea on thursday as a soldier from the north defected in thick fog, complicating efforts to ease tensions over pyongyang s nuclear and missile programs. a south korean defense ministry official said up to 20 warning shots were fired as north korean troops approached too near the  military demarcation line  at the demilitarized zone (dmz), apparently in search of the missing soldier. thursday s defection came about five weeks after a north korean soldier suffered critical gunshot wounds during a defection dash across the border. two north korean civilians were also found in a fishing boat on wednesday and had sought to defect, officials in the south said. that brings the total number of north koreans who have defected by taking dangerous routes either directly across the border or by sea to 15 so far this year, including two other soldiers. that is three times the number last year, according to south korean officials. tensions on the korean peninsula were already high after reclusive, impoverished north korea accelerated testing of its missile and nuclear programs this year in defiance of international pressure and un sanctions.  the defections also threaten to complicate south korea s efforts to ensure the smooth running of the 2018 winter olympics, which begin in pyeongchang in february. south korean president moon jae in said on tuesday he had proposed postponing major military drills with the united states until after the games in an attempt to soothe relations, although officials in seoul later said any proposed delay would depend on the north not engaging in any  provocations . in a notice published online, the u.s. military s 8th army said a  significant number of north korean propaganda leaflets and cds  had been distributed at  strategic locations  on multiple u.s. military bases in south korea.  the notice called on troops to report any suspicious individuals to help combat potential  insider threats  that could disrupt military operations. the united states stations 28,500 troops in south korea, a legacy of the 1950 53 korean war, and north korea says regular u.s. south korean military drills are a prelude to invasion. it regularly threatens to destroy the united states and its two key asian allies, south korea and japan. seoul says more than 880 north koreans have defected to the rich, democratic south so far this year, but the vast majority have taken a less dangerous route through china. going through china, north korea s neighbor and sole major ally, means they avoid the dmz, which features landmines, barbed wire, surveillance cameras, electric fencing and thousands of armed troops on both sides. the number of defectors arriving successfully in the south has dropped since north korean leader kim jong un took power in late 2011, a trend defectors and experts say may be linked to a crackdown by pyongyang. there was no immediate comment from the secretive north about the latest incidents. however, the north s state media released a statement sharply denying u.s. allegations this week that pyongyang was behind a number of recent cyber attacks. washington has publicly blamed north korean hackers for a cyber attack in may that crippled hospitals, banks and other companies. researchers also say the north was likely behind attacks on virtual currency exchanges. the military drills with the united states have also complicated relations with china. the proposed delay in drills was discussed during a summit between moon and chinese president xi jinping last week after the proposal was submitted to washington, an official at the presidential blue house said this week. china and russia have proposed a  freeze for freeze  arrangement under which north korea would stop its nuclear and missile tests in exchange for a halt to the exercises, but there has been little interest from washington or pyongyang. in thursday s defection, a low ranking soldier crossed the border near a south korean guard post, south korea s joint chiefs of staff spokesman, roh jae cheon, said. no shots were fired at the soldier. surveillance equipment detected him despite heavy fog that limited visibility to about 100 meters (110 yards), roh said. south korean guards fired about 20 warning shots at north korean troops near the border presumably searching for the defector about half an hour later, a defense ministry official in the south told reuters. gunfire from the north was detected later but the target could not be determined, the official said.  south korea s unification ministry also said maritime police had found two north korean men drifting in a small boat off the coast on wednesday. the pair  expressed their willingness to defect , a ministry official said, and their claim for asylum was being investigated. the north korean soldier who was shot several times during a daring dash across the border on nov. 13 has since been identified as 24 year old oh chong song and is now in a military hospital south of seoul. his treatment for gunshot wounds and pre existing conditions has included two major operations and intelligence officials will begin questioning him soon.

" a new york comedian has been compelled to appear before a house intelligence committee investigating suspected russian meddling in the 2016 u.s. election where he will likely face questions about acting as a go between for wikileaks and an ally of president donald trump.  randy credico, a political activist who hosted a radio show on new york radio, is scheduled to appear in front of the committee on dec. 15, according to a photo of the subpoena posted on his twitter account.  on several occasions over the last few years, credico interviewed and met with wikileaks founder julian assange, a man believed by some u.s. officials and lawmakers to be an untrustworthy pawn of russian president vladimir putin.  assange s group released democratic emails during the 2016 presidential campaign that u.s. intelligence agencies say were hacked by russia to try to tilt the election against democratic candidate hillary clinton. he is regarded with distaste by many in washington, although trump, then the republican candidate, supported the group s email releases last year. credico has also interviewed republican political consultant roger stone, a longtime trump ally, who he worked with in the past to reform new york s drug laws, according to the new york times.  stone flatly denied allegations of collusion between the president s associates and russia during the 2016 u.s. election in a meeting with house of representatives intelligence committee in september.  during his appearance in front of the committee, stone refused to identify an  opinion journalist  who had acted as a go between between stone and assange. according to stone s own account to reuters, he  reluctantly  identified the journalist as credico in written communication to the committee.  the committee has been interested in predictions that stone made about damage the email release would have on clinton s campaign, the times reported.

" the united states is troubled by reports that an iranian american man may have been sentenced by iran to 18 years in prison, a state department spokesman said on tuesday, a week after an iranian american businessman and his father were also jailed by an iranian court.  “we are troubled by reports that robin reza shahini, a person reported to be a u.s. citizen, may have been convicted and sentenced to 18 years in prison,” spokesman john kirby told a daily briefing. he called on tehran to halt “arbitrary and politically motivated detentions.” california based shahini was detained while visiting his mother in gorgan in july, according to shahini’s friends.  last week, businessman siamak namazi and his 80 year old father baquer namazi, a former iranian provincial governor and former unicef official, were sentenced to 10 years in prison on charges of cooperating with the united states. iran does not recognize dual nationality, which prevents western embassies from visiting such detainees. washington secured the release of five u.s. citizens from iran in january in a prisoner exchange and has said it raises the detention of other americans held by tehran during meetings with iranian officials. major world powers, including the united states, reached a landmark nuclear deal with iran in july last year, which lifted some international sanctions against iran.  “nobody is turning a blind eye here, but what is behind this, i don’t think any of us know with certainty,” kirby said, when asked why iran keeps detaining dual citizens. “i can’t speak to the motivation behind these detentions but if one of the motivations was to secure ransom, it is a false perception. it is wrong.” republican leaders of the u.s. house of representatives plan a vote as soon as mid november on a 10 year reauthorization of the iran sanctions act, congressional aides told reuters. the move could increase frustrations in iran, which has been complaining for months that remaining u.s. sanctions have frightened away trade partners.

" france said on thursday that russian steps to push syrian peace talks should be within the framework of united nations efforts, which paris said were the only appropriate forum to discuss a political solution to the civil war. having intervened decisively in the syrian war in 2015 in support of syrian president bashar al assad, russia now hopes to build on the collapse of islamic state to launch a political process to end the six year old conflict. on tuesday, it invited 33 syrian groups and political parties to attend what it called a  syrian congress on national dialogue  which it is organizing in the russian black sea resort of sochi on nov. 18.  the geneva process is the only appropriate and internationally agreed forum to discuss political aspects of the syrian crisis, especially for an election process and a new constitution,  french foreign ministry spokeswoman agnes romatet espagne told reporters in a daily briefing.  she urged all players, including russia, to abide by u.n. resolution 2254, which lays the foundations for a future peaceful resolution of the conflict.  international efforts, including those by russia, must be within this framework,  she added.  france, a key backer of the syrian opposition high negotiations committee (hnc), has struggled to set up its own peace initiative that would see the permanent members of the security council come to an agreement on how to move stalled peace talks forward.

" bangladesh allowed two journalists from myanmar detained while reporting about fleeing rohingya muslims to fly home on tuesday and was dropping charges against them, their lawyer said.   minzayar oo and hkun lat were picked up from the cox bazar s region in early september because they were working as journalists on tourist visas, police said. they were released on bail after calls from germany s geo magazine, which had assigned minzayar oo to cover the influx of rohingya refugees from myanmar, as well as rights groups.  it s so good to be free again,  minzayar oo, one of myanmar s most prominent photographers, told reuters soon after his plane landed in the thai capital of bangkok. bangladesh authorities had begun the process to drop the charges against the pair, their lawyer, jyotirmoy barua, said. minzayar oo has worked for various media outlets, covering myanmar s emergence from military rule. he had previously worked as a contractor with reuters.  hkun lat is also a well known photographer in myanmar and has won prizes for his coverage of conflict in frontier regions. about 582,000 refugees from myanmar have poured into bangladesh since aug. 25, when attacks by rohingya militants on security posts triggered an army crackdown in response.

" former soccer star george weah maintained his lead over vice president joseph boakai as more provisional results from liberia s presidential election were announced on friday. if current trends hold, they would contest a run off next month to decide which of them will succeed nobel peace prize winner ellen johnson sirleaf in what would be liberia s first democratic transfer of power in decades. based on returns from about a third of the country s more than 5,000 polling stations, weah has obtained 39.6 percent of votes cast, with boakai of the ruling unity party (up) at 31.1 percent, the elections commission said.   we are still confident that there are places that we believe are our strong support ... we are very optimistic that with reports coming in, up is going to take the lead,  boakai told reuters after friday s results announcement. charles brumskine, a lawyer, was running third with 9.3 percent. the final certified results from tuesday s poll must be announced by oct. 25, although the provisional first round winner is expected to be known in the coming days. weah, a striker for paris saint germain and ac milan who won fifa s world player of the year in 1995, came second to johnson sirleaf in a 2005 election that drew a line under years of civil war that killed hundreds of thousands of civilians. he has served in the senate since 2014 for the opposition congress for democratic change.  boakai, the former head of liberia s petroleum refinery company and agriculture minister, has served as vice president since 2006. brumskine and the parties of two other candidates have said the vote was marred by fraud and vowed to contest the results. but they have not provided evidence of cheating and international observers said they saw no major problems.  liberia, africa s oldest modern republic, was founded by freed u.s. slaves in 1847 but its last democratic power transfer occurred in 1944. johnson sirleaf s nearly 12 years in office have seen the country s post war peace consolidated, although liberians complain about poor public services and widespread corruption.

" the saudi led military coalition fighting houthi rebels in yemen said on wednesday it would allow humanitarian aid access through yemen s port of hodeidah and united nations flights to the capital sanaa, more than two weeks after blockading the country. the coalition closed air, land and sea access to the arabian peninsula country on nov. 6 to stop the flow of arms to the houthis from iran. the action came after saudi arabia intercepted a missile fired toward its capital riyadh. iran has denied supplying the houthis with weapons. soon after the closure, u.n. aid chief mark lowcock warned that the blockade could spark  the largest famine the world has seen for many decades with millions of victims  unless the coalition gave access to humanitarian aid.  the saudi led coalition said in a statement on wednesday that from nov. 23 the red sea port of hodeidah would be reopened to receive food aid and humanitarian relief, and sanaa airport would be open for un flights with humanitarian relief.   we re monitoring these developments,  u.n. spokesman farhan haq told reporters in new york.  if that were to happen that would be a very welcome and critically important development.   we made clear the tremendous amount of needs on the ground,  haq said.  earlier this month the coalition said it would allow aid deliveries through the government held port of aden. however, around 80 percent of yemen s food imports arrive through hodeidah. the united nations has said some seven million people in yemen are on the brink of famine and nearly 900,000 have been infected with cholera, a waterborne disease that causes acute diarrhea and dehydration. aid groups said there also needed to be commercial access to yemen for food and fuel shipments.  humanitarian aid alone cannot meet the needs of yemenis who are unjustly bearing the brunt of this war,  paolo cernuschi, yemen country director at the international rescue committee, said in a statement.  jan egeland, secretary general of the norwegian refugee council and a former u.n. aid chief, posted on twitter,  we need all ports to open and access for commercial food and supplies to large civilian population. humanitarian aid alone cannot avert hunger.   the international committee of the red cross (icrc) said on wednesday that it had evacuated from sanaa five staff members in need of urgent medical assistance. the saudi led coalition has been targeting the houthis since they seized parts of yemen in 2015, including the capital sanaa, forcing president abd rabbu mansour hadi to flee. the houthis, drawn mainly from yemen s zaidi shi ite minority and allied with long serving former president ali abdullah saleh, control much of the country.

" republican presidential candidate donald trump called democratic rival hillary clinton a threat to the country on monday, saying that if she is elected a probe into her emails could shadow her entire term in office, as the latest reuters/ipsos poll showed clinton’s lead narrowing slightly. “the investigation will last for years. the trial will probably start,” trump told a rally in grand rapids, michigan. “nothing will get done. i can tell you, your jobs will continue to leave michigan. nothing’s going to get done.” the federal bureau of investigation on friday said it was investigating newly discovered emails that might relate to clinton’s use of a private email server when she was secretary of state. clinton on monday again said she was confident that the fbi would not find anything problematic in her emails and would reach the same conclusion they did earlier this year. “it wasn’t even a close call,” she said at a rally in cincinnati, ohio, of the fbi investigation. but just eight days ahead of the election   a time when candidates typically feel that the hard work of the campaign is behind them   both clinton and trump have ratcheted up their attacks on the other’s character and fitness for office. clinton, who had been riding high in opinion polls in recent weeks as trump was hit by fallout from the release of a 2005 video in which he bragged in vulgar terms of groping women, now finds herself on the defensive. trump is hoping to convince voters that electing clinton would prompt “a constitutional crisis that we cannot afford,” as her emails would be subject to years of controversy, in the wake of the fbi’s announcement on friday that it continues to investigate material possibly related to her emails.  clinton on monday continued to level attacks against trump’s ability to control nuclear weapons. “i am running against someone who says he doesn’t understand why we can’t use nuclear weapons,” she said in cincinnati. “he wants more countries to have nuclear weapons. “i wonder if he even knows that a single nuclear warhead can kill millions of people,” she added. little is publicly known yet about the emails being investigated, other than that they were found during an unrelated probe into the estranged husband of a top clinton aide.  fbi director james comey told members of congress on friday the agency was probing more emails that might relate to clinton’s use of a private email server, but added, “we don’t know the significance of this newly discovered collection of emails.” trump, who has repeatedly referred to clinton as “corrupt hillary,” on monday said the email probe shows what a poor role model she is   seemingly trying to turn the tables on clinton, who has assailed his character over disclosures of vulgar comments he made about groping women. “i want to tell you, she is a terrible example for my son and the children of this country,” he said in warren, michigan, mentioning his youngest son, barron. “hillary is the one who broke the law over and over and over again.” (for graphic on race to the white house, click tmsnrt.rs/298mtyd) until the friday revelation, clinton had been coasting with a comfortable lead over trump. opinion polls now shows clinton’s lead over trump has narrowed slightly since early last week. it is not yet known if the email controversy will hurt her support. millions of americans have already cast their ballot in early voting. clinton holds a 5 point lead over trump in the latest reuters/ipsos poll, receiving 44 percent of likely voters compared to trump at 39 percent.  despite the controversy about her email, clinton continues to hold a large advantage in the electoral college, the process that selects a president by awarding votes through individual state elections. clinton holds leads in several key swing states, including pennsylvania and new hampshire, where trump must erode a large lead to be victorious. the fbi spent a year investigating clinton’s use of a private email server, instead of government systems, while she was secretary of state from 2009 to 2013. comey concluded in july that while clinton and her staff had been “extremely careless” in handling classified information there were no grounds for any charges.        comey, roundly criticized by republicans for his decision not to recommend charges against clinton at the end of the fbi probe in july, has now drawn the ire of senior democrats. u.s. senator harry reid, the democratic leader in the senate, accused him of “a disturbing double standard for the treatment of sensitive information, with what appears to be a clear intent to aid one political party over another.” he said, without providing evidence, that the fbi was keeping “explosive information” under wraps about ties between the trump campaign and russian officials. clinton campaign manager robby mook called reports that the fbi would not discuss whether the russian government was behind the hacking of democratic email accounts because it was too close to the election “a blatant double standard.”         in an august letter, reid asked comey to investigate whether trump allies have worked with the kremlin to influence the election, citing reports that a foreign policy adviser had met with putin allies on a july trip to moscow and longtime republican operative roger stone had been in touch with wikileaks. the white house steered clear on monday of direct criticism of comey, who was appointed by democratic president barack obama in 2013. obama

" a government watchdog group, public citizen, said on wednesday it has asked lawmakers to investigate whether carl icahn violated lobbying disclosure laws, a complaint the billionaire investor denied and called a “witch hunt.” the group said icahn may have been acting as a lobbyist when he advised president donald trump to overhaul the u.s. biofuels program. icahn, an unpaid adviser to trump on regulation, submitted a proposal to trump last month to change the u.s. renewable fuel standard by shifting the burden of blending biofuels into gasoline away from oil refining companies, and further down the supply chain to marketers. public citizen said that, because icahn owns a controlling stake in a refinery that could benefit from the proposed change, he may have been required by a 1995 lobbying disclosure law to disclose his discussions with trump on the subject as lobbying. the group said it has made its request for a probe in a letter sent to congress on wednesday morning. “all of this has occurred with no record of any (lobbying disclosure act) filings by or on behalf of mr. icahn,” public citizen said in a copy of the letter provided to reuters. icahn did not respond to reuters requests for comment but described the complaint in an opinion piece on the hill website as a “gross misstatement of the facts” and said he had vetted his activities with lawyers.  the rfs, signed into law by former president george w. bush, requires oil companies to mix increasing levels of renewable fuels into gasoline and diesel each year   a requirement that many refiners say costs them millions of dollars. oil companies can either blend biofuels or buy paper credits, known as renewable identification numbers (rin), from those that have. icahn owns an 82 percent stake in refiner cvr energy inc (cvi.n), which along with other refining companies, has urged the environmental protection agency (epa) to shift the blending obligation away from them. “while we are not fighting the renewable fuel standard, i have for months and will continue to speak out against the misguided way in which the epa has been administering the rfs” with regards to the agency’s handling of a “corrupt” rin market, icahn said. efforts to reach the white house were not immediately successful. “carl icahn is between an ethics rock and a lobbying hard place,” said norman eisen, co founder of citizens for responsibility and ethics in washington who served as the chief ethics lawyer for former president barack obama. “if he claims he is an informal advisor, then he is subject to lobbying rules.” icahn has disclosed his role as a trump adviser to the securities and exchange commission, but he has not registered as a lobbyist. several democratic lawmakers have said they want more information about his role in the trump administration.  shares of cvr energy jumped over 1 percent following icahn’s response but pared gains and was unchanged at $21.40 by 3:47 p.m. est  (2047 gmt). share values have risen about 70 percent since the presidential election. over that time, icahn’s stake has gained over $600 million in value, according to reuters data.  last week, the head of a u.s. biofuels group said icahn told him that trump was readying an executive order to change the point of obligation for blending under the biofuels program, something both the white house and icahn have denied. the white house has said it is reviewing icahn’s proposal and has not yet taken a position.

" the white house is willing to consider a small increase on the corporate tax rate if it is needed to finalize the bill in the u.s. congress, white house budget chief mick mulvaney said on sunday. mulvaney made his comments after president donald trump suggested on saturday that the corporate tax rate could end up at 22 percent once the senate and house of representatives reconcile or “conference” their respective versions of the legislation, even though both bills currently stand at 20 percent. “my understanding is that the senate (bill) has a 20 percent rate now. the house has a 20 percent rate now. we’re happy with both of those numbers,” mulvaney said in an interview with cbs’ “face the nation.” “if something small happens in conference that gets us across the finish line, we’ll look at it on a case by case basis. but i don’t think you’ll see any significant change in our position on the corporate taxes,” mulvaney said.

" panama recalled its ambassador to the eu from brussels for consultations after the central american country was included on a european union blacklist of countries deemed as tax havens, the government said on wednesday.   european union finance ministers adopted a blacklist of 17 jurisdictions deemed tax havens on tuesday, in an unprecedented step to counter worldwide tax avoidance, although they did not agree on financial levies for the listed countries.  given the unfortunate incorporation of the country in this discriminatory list, the republic of panama has decided to call its ambassador to the european union, dario chiru, to assess the steps to be followed moving forward,  the government said in a statement.  the list also included american samoa, bahrain, barbados, grenada, guam, south korea, macau, marshall islands, mongolia, namibia, palau, saint lucia, samoa, trinidad and tobago, tunisia and united arab emirates (uae). the government of the caribbean islands of trinidad and tobago said on wednesday that it soon would take two bills to parliament to reform its tax codes. passage of those bills could help it get removed from the eu blacklist, the government said.   the government of trinidad and tobago shares the goals of the eu with respect to fighting tax abuse and reassures that we will act with alacrity on this matter,  the country s attorney general said in a statement ",0
" cambodia on thursday deported 74 chinese nationals wanted in china on suspicion of extorting money from people there over the internet and by telephone, cambodian police said. this raises the number of people from china and taiwan who have been deported this year for suspected telecom scams to 346, uk heisela, the head of the cambodian police told reporters at a press conference at the airport in the capital of phnom penh. several hundred suspected scammers have been arrested in cambodia, which has emerged as a major center of rackets that have cost the victims billions of dollars. a team of chinese police arrived at the airport on a china southern airlines flight to pick up the suspects, who wore masks and had numbers marked on pink shirts. uk heisela said the 74 suspects, including 14 women, had been detained on oct. 5 in the seaside town of sihanoukville. two indonesians were also deported back to their home country.  they tricked victims in china, the civil servants there, such as teachers, medics and artists,  uk heisela said. in some cases, they had obtained naked pictures of the victims and used them for blackmail, he said. cambodia is one of china s closest allies in southeast asia. more than 400 chinese and taiwanese were arrested in cambodia in august alone for suspected telecom scams. the country s good internet connections and relaxed immigration laws have attracted con artists to carry out crimes.

" donald trump’s u.s. election victory, on the heels of britain’s vote to exit the european union, was fuelled by voters who feel neglected and shunned by establishment leaders, prominent swiss right winger christoph blocher said on wednesday.  blocher, a top official in the anti immigration swiss people’s party who engineered its ascent to become the biggest faction in the swiss parliament, said trump’s win over democrat hillary clinton was a warning to current world leaders not to go over citizens’ heads on issues including immigration. “people feel powerless against those who rule them, and for them, trump is a release valve,” blocher said in an interview. “the unexpected result ... should give pause to those who are in power around the world.”  next year, the netherlands, france and germany   and possibly italy and britain too   will hold elections in which debate is likely to be driven by populist parties over issues including immigration.

" hungary will not relinquish any of its national sovereignty to the european union and will keep fighting against the eu s quota system for taking in asylum seekers, foreign minister peter szijjarto told reuters. as the eu plunges into an intense debate over deeper integration after britain departs in 2019, szijjarto said giving up more national powers was not the way to go. his comments highlighted the resistance that proponents of a closer and deeper eu   notably french president emmanuel macron   are likely to face from one of the bloc s most prickly and nationalist minded members.  i definitely do not share the approach ... that (the) less sovereignty on the level of the member states, the stronger the eu will be. i think it is a dead end street,  szijjarto said in an interview. the right wing government of prime minister viktor orban, which currently chairs the four nation visegrad group of central european states, has been the most vocal opponent of eu migration policy and what it sees as attempts by brussels to erode member states  sovereignty. szijjarto said one area where hungary supported a common approach was defense, as having a european army would strengthen member states to the benefit of the entire bloc. but taxation policy, for example, should remain with member states as that was a matter of competitiveness. hungary has one of the eu s lowest personal income tax rates at 15 percent, and a corporate tax rate of just 9 percent. when asked in the interview late on tuesday if hungary could accept a common finance minister and budget for the eu, szijjarto said:  i understand if this is a scenario then first it only can be a scenario for the euro zone, and since we are not members of the euro zone, this question will be decided without asking our opinion.  on wednesday, however, european commission president jean claude juncker delivered an annual address in which he set out an economic vision including a finance minister for the whole eu. hungary has no target date to join the euro. szijjarto dismissed the idea that hungary or poland, which also has a eurosceptic government, were becoming isolated in the eu, or that slovakia and the czech republic were drifting away from them within the visegrad group known as the v4.  there are many attempts to break the v4 unity but they are going to remain unsuccessful,  he said, adding that the visegrad states were firm in their position to reject migrant quotas after foreign ministers met in estonia last week.  everybody reassured the others that we are going to fight and we are not going to give up our positions regarding illegal migration and regarding the quotas.  more than 1.5 million migrants and refugees have arrived in europe since 2015, many fleeing war in the middle east. the eu s highest court ruled last week that member states must take in a share of refugees, dismissing a  challenge by slovakia and hungary.  german chancellor angela merkel has urged hungary to quickly implement the court ruling, but szijjarto called it a  very dangerous  political decision.  this decision does not oblige hungary to anything because this decision was not about whether hungary has to receive migrants from tomorrow onwards,  he said.  we will always fight against obligatory quotas, we will never hide our opinion that illegal migration poses a huge threat on europe, and this position of ours remains our position, regardless of any kind of pressure that has been put on us.

" a korean woman who was forced to work at a japanese wartime military brothel and later lost a supreme court case seeking compensation from the japanese government has died in japan at the age of 95, a civic group said on tuesday. the death of song shin do leaves 32 women registered with the south korean government as surviving  comfort women , as those forced to work in wartime brothels are euphemistically known in japan. japan s 1910 1945 colonization of the korean peninsula and the legacy of world war two remain highly sensitive in south korea. the issue of  comfort women ,  is especially contentious. song was born in korea and said she was forced into sexual slavery by the japanese military for seven years in china, according to the korean council for women drafted for military sexual slavery by japan, a seoul based civic group that supports the women, which confirmed her death. after the war, song moved to japan with a japanese soldier who later left her. after that, she lived with an ethnic korean man in japan, the group said. in 1993, song filed a lawsuit with the tokyo district court seeking an official apology and compensation from the japanese government.  the case eventually went to japan s supreme court, which dismissed her appeal in 2003 on the grounds that japan had no legal obligation to pay for her suffering because a 20 year stature of limitations had expired, according to a summary by the columbia law school s center for korean legal studies. the south korean civic group said song had  suffered for seven years as a sex slave for the japanese military . some japanese ultra conservatives deny that the women were forced to work in the brothels. japan says the matter of compensation for the women was settled under a 1965 treaty with south korea.  in addition, japan s then chief cabinet secretary, yohei kono, apologized in a 1993 statement acknowledging authorities  involvement in coercing the women. two years later, japan created a fund to make payments to the women from donations, budgeted money for their welfare support and sent letters of apology from successive premiers. under a pact endorsed by japanese prime minister shinzo abe and south korean president  moon jae in s predecessor, in 2015, japan apologized again to the women and promised 1 billion yen ($9 million) for a fund to help them. the two governments agreed the issue would be  irreversibly resolved  if both fulfilled their obligations. but moon has said the south korean people did not accept the deal. reminders of japan s brutal rule are inflammatory for both sides. japan wants south korea to remove a statue near the japanese consulate in busan city commemorating korean comfort women, as well as another near the japanese embassy in seoul.

" former u.s. congressman anthony weiner has asked a judge not to sentence him to prison after he admitted to sending sexually explicit messages to a teenage girl, igniting a “sexting” scandal that played a role in last year’s u.s. presidential election. in a filing in manhattan federal court late on wednesday, weiner’s lawyers said weiner acted out of the “depths of an uncontrolled sickness.” they argued weiner should be sentenced to probation, including mental health treatment, and perform community service. weiner, 53, submitted his own letter to the court in which he apologized and said he was continuing to seek treatment. “i don’t know how i will be able to make amends to the young person who i dragged into my sordid mess,” he said. weiner’s wife, huma abedin, an aide to former democratic presidential candidate hillary clinton, has filed for divorce. she also submitted a letter to the court asking it to consider the impact of the sentence on the couple’s son.  weiner pleaded guilty in may to transferring obscene material to a minor. the charge carries a maximum sentence of 10 years, though prosecutors said as part of a plea deal that they would consider a term between 21 and 27 months “fair and appropriate.” the investigation into weiner’s exchanges with the teenage girl roiled the 2016 u.s. presidential campaign in its final days, when authorities found emails on weiner’s laptop from abedin. the discovery prompted james comey, then director of the federal bureau of investigation, to announce in late october that the agency was reviewing the messages to determine whether to reopen its investigation into clinton’s use of a private email server as u.s. secretary of state. clinton has said the announcement contributed to her upset loss to republican donald trump, who had accused her of endangering national security by using the private server. comey testified before congress in may that the emails found on weiner’s computer included classified information. trump fired comey in may amid the fbi’s probe into whether trump’s campaign colluded with russia to defeat clinton, a claim the president has denied. weiner served parts of new york city for 12 years in the u.s. house of representatives before resigning in 2011, when it emerged that he had exchanged sexually explicit messages with women. two years later, he ran for new york city mayor, but was defeated in the democratic primary after more lewd messages became public.

" merrick garland hit an unwanted milestone on tuesday as the federal appeals court judge’s nomination to the u.s. supreme court reached its 125th day with no senate action, tying for the longest pending nomination ever to the high court.  in a move with little precedent in american history, the republicans who control the senate have simply refused to take any action on president barack obama’s nomination of garland, 63, for a lifetime job on the nation’s top court.  having been nominated on march 16 to replace conservative justice antonin scalia, who died on feb. 13, garland, chief judge of the federal appeals court in washington, has now matched louis brandeis for the longest time between nomination and senate action.  in 1916, the senate voted to confirm brandeis, making him america’s first jewish justice.  the u.s. constitution assigns the senate the power to confirm the president’s nominations to the supreme court. the senate’s inaction on garland has made the court vacancy a key political prize in a presidential election year.  republicans, hopeful of winning back the white house from the democrats in the nov. 8 election, insist that obama’s successor name scalia’s replacement, who could have a lasting effect on the ideological balance of a court now split with four liberals and four conservatives.  obama has appointed two of the current justices: liberals elena kagan and sonia sotomayor.  the white house and its allies made another push on tuesday to highlight republican intransigence.  “now, despite chief judge garland’s extraordinary qualifications, republicans in the senate have refused to do their job, and chief judge garland’s nomination has now been pending longer than any supreme court nominee in history who’s nomination was not otherwise withdrawn,” white house spokesman josh earnest told reporters.  “despite his outstanding record and qualifications, republicans have obstructed judge garland’s nomination in a way faced by no other supreme court nominee in our nation’s history,” added senate democratic leader harry reid.  the senate is on recess until september.  for the rival presidential hopefuls, republican donald trump and democrat hillary clinton, the supreme court vacancy is both a political problem and an opportunity.  in addition to scalia’s replacement, the next president conceivably could nominate as many as three more justices. three of the court’s current eight members already are over age 77. that means obama’s successor could influence the court’s ideological direction for decades.  some conservatives view trump with suspicion. but the wealthy new york real estate developer has already floated names of conservative potential nominees in a bid to mollify some on the right.  garland has established a reputation as a centrist in 19 years as an appellate judge. some liberal democrats have said clinton, if elected, could put forth a nominee more liberal than garland, so republicans would be smart to approve him before obama leaves office on jan. 20.  such arguments have not swayed republican senate majority leader mitch mcconnell, who refuses to let garland come to a vote.  the development most likely to prod senate action is the result of the presidential election. some republican senators have said if clinton wins, the senate should confirm garland in a “lame duck” post election session out of fear clinton would name someone far more liberal. if clinton wins, she also could renominate garland upon taking office.  garland’s nomination is unusual because there has been no controversy over his suitability to sit on the supreme court, as there have been with some nominees in the past. he is widely respected in the legal community and has been praised by both democrats and republicans as a moderate.  the white house tried to persuade republicans to accept garland when he was first nominated in march. he met with 61 of the 100 senators. but the effort fizzled, and republicans largely followed mcconnell’s lead.  the white house since then has tried to keep the garland nomination in the public eye, with limited success. obama wrote an opinion piece in the wall street journal on monday, pushing for senate action.  a white house allied group called the constitutional responsibility project is running a “we need nine” campaign that refers to the number of justices on a fully staffed court. it has bought ads in cleveland, where the republican presidential nominating convention began on monday, calling for senators to “do your job” and bring garland’s nomination to a senate vote.  in the meantime, garland is nowhere to be seen. his last public appearance was on june 15 when he spoke at an elementary school commencement event in washington.  when nominated, garland stepped aside from pending cases before the appeals court where he works. his only official duties now are administrative as the court's chief judge. a court official said garland will continue to not participate in cases while the nomination is pending.   ",0
" the white house urged malaysia on thursday to demonstrate good governance and a transparent business climate, a day after u.s. prosecutors sued to try and seize $1 billion in assets they said were bought with money stolen from a state development fund. the civil lawsuits present a potentially thorny issue for the two countries that have grown closer during the administration of president barack obama, who has visited the southeast asian nation twice in the last two years. the lawsuits will likely affect relations, but they did not come as a surprise, said a u.s. congressional aide. “it has been a concern of a lot of people for a long time. corruption in malaysia is a huge problem,” the aide said. no criminal charges have been filed in the scandal surrounding malaysia’s 1mdb sovereign wealth fund, which was overseen by malaysian prime minister najib razak. obama spoke generally with najib on a visit to malaysia last year about the need for transparency and good governance, white house spokesman josh earnest said at a news briefing. “for business interests who are considering doing business in malaysia, they’re going to be looking for signs that there is good business climate,” earnest told reporters. the malaysian government “should be conspicuous about making clear that they’re committed to transparency and good governance, and the kind of rules that will encourage people who are considering investing in malaysia’s fast growing economy to have confidence that they can do so fairly,” earnest said. najib said in response to the lawsuits that his government would give its full cooperation to international investigations of the 1mdb case. malaysia’s foreign minister anifah aman met the u.s. ambassador to malaysia joseph yun on thursday to discuss the lawsuits. “malaysia highly values its bilateral relations with the united states and calls on the u.s. to recognize the various steps taken by the government of malaysia to address the 1mdb issue,” the ministry said in a statement on thursday night. malaysia’s attorney general mohamed apandi ali, however, expressed “strong concerns at the insinuations and allegations” of wrongdoing against najib in the lawsuits.  he said in a statement that none of the probes conducted by law enforcement agencies across the globe over the past year show that any funds were misappropriated from 1mdb. the u.s. investigation is the largest set of cases brought by the justice department’s kleptocracy asset recovery initiative, which seeks the forfeiture of the proceeds of foreign corruption. targeting assets ranging from valuable paintings and a private jet to the 2013 hit movie “the wolf of wall street” and rights to popular songs, the civil lawsuits said $3.5 billion was misappropriated from 1mdb. 1mdb said in a statement that it was not a party to the lawsuit, did not have any assets in the united states, “nor has it benefited from the various transactions described.” ",0

" the united states will switch course on climate change and pull out of a global pact to cut emissions, said myron ebell, who headed u.s. president donald trump’s environmental protection agency (epa) transition team until his inauguration. ebell is the director of global warming and international environmental policy at the competitive enterprise institute, a  u.s. conservative think tank, and helped to guide the epa’s transition after trump was elected in november until he was sworn in on jan. 20. trump, a climate skeptic, campaigned on a pledge to boost the u.s. oil and gas drilling and coal mining industries by reducing regulation. he alarmed nations that backed the 2015 paris agreement to cut greenhouse gases by pledging to pull the united states out of the global deal agreed by nearly 200 countries. however, trump told the new york times in november that he had an “open mind” on the agreement. trump’s administration has asked the epa to halt all contracts, grants and interagency agreements pending a review, sources said. “the u.s. will clearly change its course on climate policy. trump has made it clear he will withdraw from the paris agreement. he could do it by executive order tomorrow or he could do it as part of a larger package,” ebell told reporters in london on monday. the top energy official for the european union, meanwhile, said he hoped that trump would stick to the paris deal. “i wouldn’t hide that in discussion with our partners; there is a lot of anxiety over future u.s. policies,” said european commission vice president maros sefcovic, who was a key broker in clinching paris agreement. “if the (u.s) administration decides to go in a different direction, i think sooner or later they will have to come back to the realization that climate change is happening.”     the timing of any action by trump is difficult to predict because government departments are still in transition, ebell said, adding that he had not met trump in person.  any country wanting to pull out of the paris agreement after ratifying it has to wait four years. a source on trump’s transition team said last year that there were speedier alternatives, such as sending a letter withdrawing from the 1992 international framework accord that is the parent treaty of the agreement; voiding u.s. involvement in both in a year’s time; or issuing a presidential order simply deleting the u.s. signature from the paris accord. ebell said the “cleanest way” would be to withdraw from the united nations framework convention on climate change itself. “whether the u.n. secretariat wants the u.s. to continue to have a seat at the table is up to them. i don’t think trump cares about that. the people who elected him would prefer not to have a seat at the table,” ebell said. trump appointed oklahoma attorney general scott pruitt, who has led 14 lawsuits against the epa, as the agency’s administrator, though a vote on his nomination has not been scheduled. the president has also drawn heavily from the energy industry lobby and pro drilling think tanks to build its landing team for the epa, according to a list of the newly introduced 10 member team seen by reuters on monday. ebell also said he thought the political make up of the federal energy regulatory commission, which reviews applications for the construction and operation of natural gas pipelines, will change dramatically under trump. “given the way the campaign went, i think you will see very quick executive action to expedite lng (liquefied natural gas) terminals and pipelines,” he said.

" philippine president rodrigo duterte s son on thursday told a senate inquiry he had no links to a seized shipment of $125 million worth of narcotics from china, dismissing as  baseless  the allegations of his involvement in the drugs trade. opponents of the president, who has instigated a fierce crackdown on a trade he says is destroying the country, say they believe his son paolo may have helped ease the entry of the drug shipment at the port in manila, the capital.  on tuesday duterte said he had told paolo to attend the senate investigation if he had nothing to hide, besides advising him not to answer questions and invoke his right to keep silent.  i cannot answer allegations based on hearsay,  paolo duterte, the vice mayor of the southern city of davao, told the senate.   my presence here is for the filipino people and for my fellow davaoe os whom i serve,  he added, referring to the people of davao, where his father served as mayor for more than two decades before being elected president in 2016.  the philippine leader has repeatedly said he would resign if critics could prove any members of his family were involved in corruption. senator antonio trillanes, a staunch critic of the president, displayed to the senate panel photographs of paolo duterte beside a businessman who was behind the shipment in which the alleged drugs were found. the president s son in law, manases carpio, who has also been accused of links to the may drug shipment from china, told the hearing he had no involvement.  duterte unleashed his bloody campaign the day he took office on june 30 last year, after promising filipinos he would use deadly force to wipe out crime and drugs. police records show more than 3,800 people have died in police operations since july last year, and more than 2,100 other reported murders are linked to drugs. police reject activists  allegations that they are executing suspected drug users and dealers and say officers shoot only in self defense. trillanes said he had intelligence information from an undisclosed foreign country that paolo duterte was a member of a criminal syndicate, citing as proof a  dragon like  tattoo with secret digits on his back.  asked about the tattoo, duterte said he had one, but declined to describe it, invoking his right to privacy. asked by trillanes if he would allow a photograph to be taken of the tattoo and sent to the u.s drug enforcement agency to decode secret digits, duterte said:  no way . he refused to respond to questions about his bank accounts, calling them  irrelevant . presidential spokesman ernesto abella said the attendance of duterte and carpio  demonstrates that both gentlemen are willing and ready to face malicious allegations intended to impugn their character and credibility.

" imprisoned former vice president of catalonia oriol junqueras and three other jailed members of his erc party will abide by a ruling giving madrid control over the region, their defense lawyer said on tuesday. junqueras and seven other former members of the catalonia regional cabinet were jailed on nov. 2 pending trial, accused of sedition, rebellion and misappropriation of funds after the local government declared independence from spain. catalonia s secession drive has tipped spain into its worst political crisis in decades and prompted madrid to sack the catalan government, led by carles puigdemont, and call a regional election for dec. 21. the acceptance of madrid s rule over the region could prompt the supreme court to overrule the decision to hold the defendants in custody while they await trial, and release them in time to campaign for the election. all four jailed erc members   junqueras, former foreign affairs chief raul romeva, justice affairs head carles mundo and work chief dolors bassa   have been named as candidates in the election. the defendants did not agree with the application of article 155, which stripped the regional government of its power after the secessionist ruling, but accepted it, their lawyer said in a statement to the supreme court.  my charges accepted, and accept, the application of 155 ... but have done so from a position of deep political and judicial discrepancy,  the lawyer said. the lawyer added that the statement does not mean that they renounce their political convictions.  former leader of catalonia puigdemont, who has been in self imposed exile in belgium since declaring independence, said on saturday the election would be most important in the region s history.  turnout for the election is expected to reach a record 80 percent as the deeply divisive issue of the region s secession prompts participation from both sides. less than a quarter of catalans want to continue with a plan to claim independence from spain, according to a poll published in el pais newspaper on monday. however, the same poll showed the vote evenly split between pro  and anti independence parties in the upcoming regional election.

" the top republican in the u.s. house of representatives is expected to reassure business leaders on tuesday that tax reform is on track for this year, despite repeated delays and a string of political distractions from president donald trump. in what is billed as a major speech, house speaker paul ryan will seek to dispel the notion that tax reform is adrift by describing what a u.s. tax code overhaul will look like, according to a source close to ryan’s office.  the speaker will emphasize the importance of permanent reforms and reject the notion that legislation should do little more than reduce tax rates, the source said. he will underscore the need for international corporate tax reforms in remarks to the national association of manufacturers. aides said he is not expected to delve into the details of tax proposals. the wisconsin republican delivered a similar optimistic message to lobbyists and campaign donors in virginia over the weekend, adding that he expected congress to finalize legislation to dismantle obamacare by mid summer, according to a source familiar with the speaker’s comments. originally expected to unveil tax reform legislation in the spring, republicans are under pressure from business lobbyists to make good on campaign pledges to reform the tax code and pass healthcare legislation. lawmakers also need legislative victories to stave off democratic challenges in next year’s congressional mid term elections.          “what ryan needs to do is refocus folks on the rationale for having tax reform, not just the political rationale, but the economic rationale,” said jeff kupfer, a former economic adviser to president george w. bush. markets have been anticipating lower taxes. major stock indexes have hit multiple record highs from trump’s election to the end of the first quarter, on bets he would improve economic growth by cutting taxes and boosting infrastructure spending. the tax reform debate has largely moved behind closed doors, where ryan is trying to hammer out an agreement with senate republican leader mitch mcconnell, treasury secretary steven mnuchin, white house economic adviser gary cohn and republican chairmen of the two congressional tax committees. the aim is to unveil tax reform legislation in september.  outside those discussions, lawmakers have begun to talk about legislation that would do little more than cut taxes, with temporary reductions financed by the federal deficit.

" divisions have emerged among advisers to president donald trump over whether to rescind a signature policy of his predecessor, president barack obama, that shields young immigrants from deportation, according to congressional sources and republicans close to the white house. even though trump campaigned on a promise to roll back obama’s executive orders on immigration, the republican has so far left intact an order safeguarding 750,000 people who were brought to the united states illegally as children, known as the “dreamers.” the issue has become a flashpoint for white house advisers divided between a more moderate faction such as chief of staff reince priebus and immigration hardliners stephen miller and steve bannon, said a former congressional aide who has been  involved with immigration issues in washington.      priebus has said publicly that trump will work with congress to get a “long term solution” on the issue.  meanwhile, miller, said to have mastered the thinking of his former boss and anti immigration advocate jeff sessions, trump’s nominee for u.s. attorney general, as well as bannon, former head of right wing breitbart news, have pushed trump to take a harder approach and rescind the protections.  two officials at the department of homeland security expect trump to simply stop renewing the authorizations that “dreamers” currently have to work, drive and obtain higher education. under that plan, the most recently renewed authorizations would expire in two years.   but a senior house republican aide said it was uncertain whether the administration had scrapped the idea of overturning obama’s deferred action for childhood arrivals, known as daca, as the internal debate plays out.   preserving daca has also become somewhat of a bartering chip as trump seeks congressional support for a wall on the u.s. mexico border and other early administration priorities. the white house is “acutely aware” of the firestorm in the country and within congress that could swamp the fledgling administration just as it plunges into negotiations over the wall, healthcare, tax reform and infrastructure investments, said the senior house republican aide. another congressional aide described a senate bill sponsored by democrat dick durbin and republican lindsey graham to protect the “dreamers” as the “sugar that would help the medicine of the wall go down.”  the bill would likely face challenges winning enough votes to pass. efforts to attach some tough conservative amendments could lose democratic party support and sink the whole effort.  trump has kept his public comments on daca vague. in an interview with abc news on wednesday, trump said his administration would be coming out with a policy to deal with “dreamers” over the next four weeks.  “they shouldn’t be very worried. they are here illegally. they shouldn’t be very worried. i do have a big heart. we’re going to take care of everybody. we’re going to have a very strong border,” trump said in the interview with abc.  trump reportedly told durbin during the inaugural luncheon at the capitol on jan. 20 that he did not have to worry about an executive action overturning obama’s order. but there is scant trust among democrats that trump will keep his word. and immigration advocates said daca recipients live in fear and uncertainty as the message from the white house and republicans seems to shift by the day.     house speaker paul ryan told a woman protected by daca, at a townhall hosted by cnn jan. 12, that there should be a solution for people like her to get “right with the law” and not be separated from their families.  just two days prior, sessions, a senator, told a senate panel considering his confirmation that it would “certainly be constitutional” to repeal daca. sessions also attempted to force a vote to block daca in the senate in 2014.  miller, sessions’ former staffer, is now trump’s senior adviser for policy at the white house.  miller is known to be a staunch advocate for restricting immigration, even by workers who enter legally on visas.  both miller and bannon, trump’s senior counselor and chief strategist, are seen as outsiders to the republican establishment and unafraid to upset people like ryan to stay true to trump campaign promises. priebus, however, came to the white house after chairing the republican national committee and has spent years seeking to unify the party and cultivating relationships with career politicians.

" u.s. president donald trump said on tuesday he had picked an employment lawyer who has represented companies and business groups for a vacancy on the national labor relations board. the selection of william emanuel, 75, to fill one of the two vacancies at the agency brings it closer to having a republican majority, which is expected to undo a series of recent decisions seen as favoring unions. the five member nlrb oversees union elections and disputes between workers, unions, and employers.  emanuel, a los angeles based partner at law firm littler mendelson, has worked with republicans in congress and major trade groups from an array of industries, and has for decades defended employers in cases before the board. he is a member of the conservative federalist society, an influential group of lawyers credited with pushing trump to nominate u.s. supreme court justice neil gorsuch to the high court. emanuel said in a statement that it is an honor to be nominated. industry groups such as the national retail federation and the national restaurant association hailed emanuel’s nomination, saying he would help repair damage done to businesses by rulings from the nlrb during the barack obama administration. trump last week said he intended to nominate fellow republican marvin kaplan, a lawyer with the federal occupational safety and health review commission, to another vacancy on the board.  the positions require confirmation by the u.s. senate.  the nlrb has been controlled by democrats for nearly a decade and they currently have a 2 1 majority. when it has no vacancies, the board typically includes three members from the president’s party and two from the opposing party. under trump, lawyers and business groups expect the board to roll back a series of policy changes adopted during the administration of former president barack obama. they include rules designed to speed the union election process and a 2015 decision that made it easier for companies to be held liable for legal violations by contractors, staffing agencies, and franchisees. it was not clear when the senate could vote on trump’s nominees but several lawyers and other experts said the process could stretch into the fall. kaplan previously worked for republicans in the u.s. house of representatives crafting employment related legislation.

" u.s. senate democrats, in a letter to majority leader mitch mcconnell, on wednesday called for congressional action on  puerto rico, demanding that legislation to resolve the island’s financial crisis include tools to restructure debt. “restructuring legislation would not cost the federal government a single penny and would instead save u.s. taxpayers from the growing cost of inaction,” said the letter to the senate’s republican leader, signed by all 46 democrats and independents. the letter is a challenge to republicans who largely oppose letting the u.s. commonwealth restructure debt. republican senators orrin hatch of utah, lisa murkowski of alaska and chuck grassley of iowa last month introduced a bill to bring puerto rico’s finances under federal oversight without providing for debt restructuring.  democrats have argued that federal oversight should be conditional on allowing puerto rico to be governed by federal bankruptcy or debt restructuring laws. hatch, murkowski and grassley are cc’d on the letter. “puerto rico was included in chapter 9 of the u.s. bankruptcy code until 1984, when congress inexplicably excluded it from the nationwide approach to resolving municipal insolvency,” said the letter, a draft of which was first reported by reuters last week. the letter’s broad support is key because, with 44 democrats and two independents on board, democrats could block bills that do not include a restructuring mechanism. still, that is no guarantee that republicans, who control congress, will draft a bill that includes one. a restructuring option would be a coup for the island’s governor, alejandro garcia padilla, who has long said puerto rico needs to cut its $70 billion in debt to grow its economy, a stance that has faced resistance from creditors. aside from its debt load, puerto rico faces widespread economic strain, including a 45 percent poverty rate and a shrinking tax base, as a growing number of citizens jump to the u.s. mainland. senate democratic leader harry reid, speaking on the senate floor on wednesday, said congress must do more than hold hearings or create a task force on puerto rico, stressing that the island needs “to be treated as other american citizens and be able to file bankruptcy.” the letter comes weeks after house speaker paul ryan demanded legislation by the end of march to address puerto rico.  “we urge you to match his commitment to act ... by the end of the first quarter,” said the letter to mcconnell.

" the united states and china had a frank exchange of views on the disputed south china sea during a visit to beijing by u.s. president donald trump on thursday, u.s. secretary of state rex tillerson said. china claims almost the entire strategic waterway through which about $3 trillion worth of goods pass every year, building and militarizing artificial islands. brunei, malaysia, the philippines, taiwan and vietnam also have conflicting claims. the issue is likely to feature prominently at two regional summits starting this week, one in vietnam and the other in the philippines, which trump and several leaders will attend. chinese president xi jinping will attend the vietnam meeting. “we had a frank exchange here in china on maritime security issues and the south china sea. the u.s. position remains unchanged,” tillerson told reporters.  “we insist on upholding freedom of navigation, that claimants be consistent with international law and that claimants should stop construction and militarization of outposts in order to maximize prospects for successful diplomacy,” he added. both xi and trump expressed support for the protection of peace and stability in the south china sea, china’s foreign ministry said in a statement following the leaders’ talks.    both leaders also support the peaceful resolution and management of the dispute via talks and in accordance with “accepted international law”, it added. “both sides support the protection of freedom of navigation and overflight for all countries, in accordance with international law,” it said.the united states has angered china with freedom of navigation patrols close to chinese controlled islands in the south china sea, which have been continued by the trump administration. philippine president rodrigo duterte, in an apparent policy shift, said on wednesday he planned to ask china to make clear its intentions in the south china sea, during asia pacific economic cooperation (apec) meetings in vietnam. since coming to office 16 months ago, the firebrand leader has been conciliatory to beijing, despite a ruling by an international arbitration court favoring the philippines in its territorial dispute with china. in the past, duterte has repeatedly said he will raise the sea dispute at the proper time and avoided the issue when manila hosted two regional meetings this year.

" britain s prince william and his wife kate are expecting their third child, their office said on monday after the duchess was forced to cancel an engagement due to severe morning sickness. britain s monarchy has ridden a wave of public support in recent years due to the popularity of william, kate, and william s brother harry, and the news was soon making headlines around the world.  queen elizabeth, who is 91, said she was delighted.  the baby will be fifth in line to the british throne, after grandfather prince charles, father william and elder siblings george, 4, and charlotte, 2.  the popular harry becomes sixth in line to the throne.   their royal highnesses the duke and duchess of cambridge are very pleased to announce that the duchess of cambridge is expecting their third child,  kensington palace said.   the queen and members of both families are delighted with the news.  the couple did not say when the baby was due.   kate and william married in a lavish ceremony in 2011 watched by about two billion people around the world. two years later the international camera crews and photographers camped outside a london hospital to record the birth of george, and returned two years later for his sister charlotte. george and charlotte have since appeared on the front covers of magazines around the world and traveled on official royal tours of poland and germany with their parents. george will attend his first day of primary school later this week.   this is fantastic news,  british prime minister theresa may said.  many congratulations to the duke and duchess of cambridge.  william and harry have been in the headlines in recent weeks as they led the efforts to remember their mother princess diana who died in a car crash in paris 20 years ago last thursday. in a sign of how the young royals have helped to modernize the house of windsor, the princes have spoken about the trauma of her death and its lasting emotional impact. harry was in manchester visiting a center supporting people affected by a bombing at an ariana grande concert in may when he gave his reaction.  fantastic, great, very very happy for them,  he said.  kate last appeared with the princes on wednesday when they visited a public garden at kensington palace dedicated to diana but the palace said she would not attend an engagement at a children s center on monday due to ill health.   as with her previous two pregnancies, the duchess is suffering from hyperemesis gravidarum....,  the palace said.  the duchess is being cared for at kensington palace.  hyperemesis gravidarum can cause severe nausea and vomiting and requires supplementary hydration and nutrients. the condition forced kate to be admitted to hospital in the early months of her first pregnancy with george. the couple have returned to live in kensington palace after an earlier spell in norfolk, eastern england, enabling them to dedicate more time to their royal duties on behalf of william s  grandmother, the queen. william has also given up his job as an air ambulance helicopter pilot.  one of three herself, kate had prompted speculation earlier this year that she wanted a third child when she was presented with a cuddly toy designed for newborns during a trip, telling william:  we will just have to have more babies.

" president donald trump’s former campaign manager paul manafort offered to post more than $12 million in real estate and life insurance assets and to limit his travel in a bid to avoid continued house arrest, according to court documents filed on saturday. manafort, who ran trump’s presidential campaign for several months last year, and associate richard gates earlier this week pleaded not guilty to a 12 count indictment by a federal grand jury.  the charges include conspiracy to launder money, conspiracy against the united states and failing to register as foreign agents of ukraine’s former pro russian government. they are part of special counsel robert mueller’s investigation into alleged russian efforts to tilt the 2016 election in trump’s favor and potential collusion by trump associates. in the saturday court filing, manafort offered to limit his travel to new york, washington and florida and pledged life insurance worth about $4.5 million as well as about $8 million in real estate assets, including a property on fifth avenue in new york that was identified by some media outlets as an apartment in trump tower. u.s. district judge amy berman jackson said on thursday that initial bail terms would remain in place and set a bail hearing for monday to consider changes. on friday, she suggested a potential may 7 trial date. manafort and gates are under house arrest, under unsecured bonds of $10 million and $5 million, respectively, which means they do not have to post the bail unless they fail to show up for court or violate other conditions. prosecutors have argued there is a risk of flight and both men are subject to electronic monitoring. as part of the indictment, the special counsel’s office is seeking forfeiture of four of manafort’s properties in connection with money laundering charges. peter carr, a spokesman for mueller, declined to comment on saturday. manafort, 68, in the filing also explained why he had three different u.s. passports, a fact noted by prosecutors. manafort’s lawyer, kevin downing, rejected suggestions that manafort was a “jason bourne character”   referencing a fictitious, globe trotting, rogue covert agent. “the facts are much more mundane,” downing wrote. manafort had two passports, including one for submitting to foreign governments to receive visas while traveling on the other, his lawyers said. he was issued a third passport because one had been lost and manafort contacted passport services to advise them it was found. downing also wrote that funds manafort had deposited in accounts on the island of cyprus were legal and now had only “nominal” balances. prosecutors said manafort and gates used numerous entities to transmit more than $18 million from ukraine through cyprus and eventually to the united states.  federal prosecutors said in a court filing on tuesday that manafort’s financial assets were substantial, but difficult to quantify because he listed figures on loan applications and other financial documents since 2012 that ranged from $19 million to $136 million. the investigation has cast a shadow over the first nine months of the trump presidency. for manafort and gates, a conviction on conspiracy to launder money alone could carry a sentence of up to 20 years in prison.

"the washington post   nearly a third of territory reclaimed from the islamic state in iraq and syria since 2014 has been won in the past six months, due to new policies adopted by the trump administration, a senior state department official said friday.brett mcgurk, the state department s senior envoy to the anti-islamic state coalition, said that steps president trump has taken, including delegating decision-making authority down from the white house to commanders in the field, have  dramatically accelerated  gains against the militants.combined islamic state losses in both countries since the group s peak control in early 2015 total about 27,000 square miles of territory   78 percent of militant holdings in iraq and 58 percent in syria. about 8,000 square miles have been reclaimed under trump, mcgurk said in a briefing for reporters.although the trump administration has yet to announce its new strategy for the campaign against the islamic state, mcgurk cited  key changes  under trump. in addition to the delegation of decision-making authority, which he said has allowed much greater responsiveness to opportunities and changing circumstances, he cited a  campaign of annihilation  that has concentrated on surrounding cities held by the militants before launching offensives, to ensure that no militants will escape.he said the 2,000 militants remaining in raqqa  most likely will die in raqqa.  the united nations has estimated that 25,000 civilians also remain in the city.mcgurk, who held the same job in the obama administration, also cited renewed administration efforts to  increase burden sharing from the coalition  among what he said were 73 countries. most of them do not contribute to the warfighting but are expected to help with stabilization efforts in cleared areas, including in the iraqi city of mosul, where u.s.-backed iraq security forces declared victory over the islamic state last month.",1
" warren buffett is closely monitoring whether u.s. president donald trump can lower corporate taxes, one of the rare times the billionaire has looked to washington to help him decide which stocks to buy and sell. “it’s an actual factor at berkshire,” buffett, the chairman of berkshire hathaway inc (brka.n), said in a tuesday interview with cnbc television. “and it’s very, very, very seldom in my 87 years that it has ever been a factor.” buffett normally buys stocks for the long term with less focus on tax issues. but when asked if he was thinking about taxes, he said “i think about them plenty” now. “we’ve got actions on both sides that we would take,” referring to taking gains or realizing losses, he said. berkshire has said it ended june with more than $135 billion of equity investments, which buffett mainly controls and holds for the long term. the conglomerate is sitting on huge gains in big investments such as american express co (axp.n), coca cola co (ko.n) and wells fargo & co (wfc.n), while other bets such as international business machines corp (ibm.n) have fared less well. buffett had said at berkshire’s annual meeting in omaha, nebraska, on may 6 that he would rather realize losses than take gains if he expected rates to fall. that might be a good strategy now, if trump and many congressional republicans succeeded in lowering the top corporate tax rate to 20 percent from 35 percent. buffett explained that he would “feel kind of silly” realizing a $1 billion gain and paying $350 million in taxes, only to have congress lower the rate and thus his tax bill. he said other investors sitting on “hundreds of billions” of dollars of potential profits might be thinking the same thing. it is unclear whether the republican controlled congress can pass a tax bill that trump will sign, and buffett said it has been unable to overhaul the affordable care act or move forward on infrastructure, two of the president’s priorities. he expects to know by year end whether taxes are going down. “i would think the republicans controlling both houses [of congress] and the presidency, they would not want to have a shutout, in their first year,” buffett said. “i think they can get it done.” ",0
" describing brexit as  nonsense , german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble warned on monday against allowing europe to divide further along east west lines, saying this would be a  catastrophe . speaking at his 75th birthday party in the southwestern town of offenburg, schaeuble paused after mentioning britain in the context of europe. laughter broke out among the guests and, in an aside, he said britons were probably unhappy now with their vote last year to leave the eu.  if we were now to get new divisions between east and west after the british   it was nonsense to take such a decision and they are probably no longer happy with it   that would be a catastrophe,  he said.  we must be clear: we will only have a good future, history shows this, if we hold europe together, and that means all of europe,  he added. schaeuble appeared to be referring to a deepening divide between eastern countries like poland and hungary and their eu partners to the west over democratic values, acceptance of refugees and further european integration. french president emmanuel macron has been especially critical of governments in warsaw and budapest, which the eu says are distancing themselves from core european values like free speech and rule of law. germany, in part because of its history with poland, has been less openly critical of its eastern neighbors, but it has tacitly supported macron and steps by the eu to ratchet up pressure on governments in the east. many poles, especially rightwing supporters of the ruling law and justice party, are animated by a hatred of germans dating to world war two, though relations have warmed up since the end of communism when germany backed polish eu membership. last week, european commission chief jean claude juncker stressed his wish to heal divisions between eastern and western states. juncker also attended schaeuble s party on monday and praised him for working to unify the eu.  schaeuble said those eu states that want to press ahead with closer integration must do so.  but we must also be careful that not only the big states decide. i learned that from kohl,  he said with reference to late chancellor helmut kohl, with whom he worked on the reunification of germany.

" u.s. president donald trump is weeks away from naming anyone to the board of the federal reserve, a white house official said, meaning it could be the fall before three currently empty seats are filled. the vacancies on the fed’s seven member board of governors include the position of vice chair in charge of banking oversight, a critical role in trump’s plan to revamp financial rules. the white house wants to get all nominees vetted by the federal bureau of investigation and the office of government ethics before they name them publicly and that process can take months, according to people familiar with the matter. if the vetting drags on, it runs the risk of delaying those people from taking their jobs until sometime this fall, complicating trump’s plan to reshape regulation of wall street. the fed positions require confirmation by the senate and could be delayed further by a five week congressional recess from the end of july to the beginning of september. randal quarles, a veteran of the george w. bush administration, is expected to be trump’s pick for the fed’s top bank regulator, reuters has previously reported. trump met him late last month, according to sources familiar with the matter. quarles, who worked as a partner at private equity firm the carlyle group, currently runs a private investment firm, the cynosure group, from salt lake city, utah. he also served in the treasury department under bush and was the u.s. executive director of the international monetary fund. quarles did not immediately respond to a request for comment on thursday. a spokesman for the federal reserve declined to comment. the vice chair for supervision and regulation and another seat that governs community banking were created as part of the 2010 dodd frank financial reform law but were never filled by president barack obama. former fed governor daniel tarullo had stepped in to fill the supervision void before leaving the central bank in april. the white house would like to name all three regulatory positions at the fed at the same time, according to people familiar with the matter. but treasury secretary steven mnuchin dismissed that idea publicly last month, saying, “i don’t think we’re going to do that.” in addition to the three current vacancies, one of which must be filled by someone with community banking experience, chair janet yellen and stanley fischer, the vice chairman, could step down when their terms expire next year. trump could therefore fill as many as five of the board’s seven seats within the next year, giving him the opportunity to nominate a block of people who will have a big say in the direction of interest rates.

" u.s. government officials declined on tuesday to characterize the treatment of myanmar s rohingya muslims as ethnic cleansing, but listed new measures including targeted sanctions washington is considering to address the crisis.  i m not in a position ... to characterize it today, but to me this very closely resembles some of the worst kind of atrocities that i ve seen during a long career,  mark storella deputy assistant secretary of state from the bureau of population, refugees and migration said at a senate hearing, when pressed to say whether he viewed the situation as ethnic cleansing. hundreds of thousands of rohingya muslims have fled myanmar s rakhine state since security forces responded to rohingya militants  attacks on aug. 25 by launching a crackdown the united nations has denounced as ethnic cleansing. myanmar, also known as burma, rejects that accusation, insisting action was needed to combat  terrorists  who killed civilians. but it has left the world community counting the cost as international organizations and the government of bangladesh, which has taken in the vast majority of the refugees, race to provide food, water and medical care. many u.s. lawmakers have clamored for a strong u.s. response to the crisis and criticized government leader aung san suu kyi, a nobel peace laureate once hugely popular in washington, for failing to do more.  she s an impressive person, but she s not taking on the challenge,  said senator ben cardin, the ranking democrat on the senate foreign relations committee. cardin said he considered the treatment of the rohingya genocide. the state department said on monday that washington is taking steps and considering a range of further actions over myanmar s treatment of the rohingya, including targeted sanctions under its global magnitsky law. [l2n1mz01t] at the foreign relations committee hearing, patrick murphy, deputy assistant secretary of state for east asian and pacific affairs, said broader sanctions were also being considered, but cautioned that doing so could lessen the u.s. government s ability to influence the myanmar government to change.

" russia and its president vladimir putin should expect tough sanctions after cyber attacks during the presidential election won by donald trump, u.s. republican senator lindsey graham said on wednesday. earlier this month, republican and democratic senators including graham called for a bipartisan panel to investigate cyber attacks against the united states by foreign countries, with a focus on russia’s alleged efforts to influence the u.s. presidential election. “there will be bipartisan sanctions coming that will hit russia hard, particularly putin as an individual,” graham said in the latvian capital. nato members latvia, estonia and lithuania, all ruled by moscow in communist times, have been alarmed by russia’s annexation of ukraine’s crimea peninsula in 2014 and its support for pro russian separatists in eastern ukraine. “it is now time for russia to understand – enough is enough,” graham said. he did not elaborate further on what the sanctions could entail. u.s. intelligence agencies have concluded that russia tried to influence the nov. 8 election by hacking individuals and institutions, including democratic party bodies. russian officials have denied accusations of interference in the election. “here’s what you can expect in 2017 in the united states – a bipartisan effort in congress to push back against the russian interference in our election,” graham said at a stop on a three day visit to the baltics with fellow republican senator john mccain, seen as a bid to soothe concerns over the policy of president elect trump. separately, the estonian defence minister said the country was increasing its efforts to defend itself against cyber attacks after nato recognised cyber attacks as an element of warfare, alongside land, sea and air. in what estonian officials say was a wake up call, the country was hit by cyber attacks on extensive private and government internet sites in 2007. state websites were brought to a crawl and an online banking site was closed. lithuania also said last week the kremlin was responsible for cyber attacks that have hit government computers there over the past two years. putin’s spokesman dismissed the allegations as unsubstantiated.   lithuanian intelligence services, in their annual report, say cyber attacks have moved from being mainly targeted at financial crimes to more political spying on state institutions. “we have almost finished the submission for the government to create the new cyber command and it should be up and running within two years”, estonia’s defence minister margus tsahkna told reuters on wednesday. nato leaders agreed earlier this year to deploy military forces to the baltic states and eastern poland for the first time and increase air and sea patrols to reassure allies on its eastern border. estonia is due to host around 1,000 british, french and danish troops in 2017.

" survivors of a blaze that killed 71 people six months ago in the grenfell tower social housing block in west london wept during a multi faith memorial service at st paul s cathedral on thursday attended by members of the royal family. bereaved relatives held pictures of their loved ones as they commemorated britain s deadliest fire since world war two, a tragedy that has profoundly shocked the nation. fire broke out in the middle of the night on june 14 and quickly gutted the 24 storey building, which was home to a multi ethnic community living in a poor area within one of london s richest boroughs, kensington and chelsea. the disaster highlighted the area s extreme disparities in living conditions between rich and poor and fueled a debate over why safety concerns voiced by tower residents before the fire had been ignored. the service reflected the multi cultural character of the grenfell community, with christian and muslim prayers and music from middle eastern, caribbean and western traditions. it also addressed the anger of many survivors over what they perceive as the neglect of their community before and after the fire. a majority of the hundreds of people displaced by the fire are still staying in hotels because suitable permanent homes have not been provided yet.  today we ask why warnings were not heeded, why a community was left feeling neglected, uncared for, not listened to,  graham tomlin, bishop of kensington, told the congregation.   today we hold out hope that the public inquiry will get to the truth of all that led up to the fire at grenfell tower ...  and we trust that the truth will bring justice.  police are investigating the fire and say charges may be brought against individuals or organizations. a separate public inquiry is under way on the causes of the fire and the authorities  response. prime minister theresa may, opposition labour leader jeremy corbyn, london mayor sadiq khan, heir to the throne prince charles and his sons prince william and prince harry were among those attending the service along with bereaved families and firefighters who took part in the rescue effort on the night. the devastation inside grenfell tower was such that it took police and forensic scientists several months to recover and identify all human remains. the final death toll was 53 adults and 18 children. the service began when a white banner bearing a large green heart emblazoned with the word  grenfell  was carried through the congregation to the pulpit by a catholic priest and muslim cleric from the area around the charred tower. later, a young syrian musician played a mournful tune on the oud, an instrument commonly played in the middle east and parts of africa, where many grenfell residents had ties.  a choir of muslim schoolgirls performed a song called  inshallah , and survivor nadia jafari, who escaped from the tower but lost her elderly father ali, read a poem called  remember me  by the 13th century persian poet and scholar rumi. the service also included a rendition of leonard cohen s  hallelujah  performed by a caribbean style steel band, and a performance of  somewhere  from the musical  west side story.  schoolchildren from the grenfell area scattered green hearts, a symbol of solidarity with the victims and survivors, around the cathedral s altar.

" leaders of the u.s. senate intelligence committee said on wednesday the issue of whether president donald trump s 2016 election campaign colluded with russia remains an open question as the panel intensifies its probe into the matter. republican chairman richard burr and democratic vice chairman mark warner also warned about the risk to future u.s. elections posed by russia, including what is expected to be a closely contested election next month for governor of warner s home state, virginia. burr told reporters the committee plans to conduct 25 more interviews with witnesses this month, but described his goal of finishing this year the main congressional investigation into russian meddling as only  aspirational  at this point.  the issue of collusion is still open,  burr said, standing alongside warner at a press conference to provide an update on the investigation.  we have not come to any determination on collusion,  he said. burr said he wanted very much to conclude the investigation before the height of campaigning for november 2018 u.s. mid term elections, when all 435 seats in the house of representatives and one third of the 100 seat senate will be up for grabs. warner said the united states needed a  whole of government  approach to combating interference with u.s. elections.  the russian active measures efforts did not end on election day, 2016,  he said.  trump, who has called allegations of campaign collusion with moscow a hoax, has faced questions about the matter since he took office in january. a special counsel appointed by the justice department, robert mueller, is conducting a separate probe that could lead to criminal charges. russia denies meddling. u.s. intelligence agencies concluded that russia interfered in the election to try to help trump defeat democratic candidate hillary clinton through a campaign of hacking and releasing embarrassing emails, and disseminating propaganda via social media to discredit her campaign. burr said the committee agreed with the intelligence community s conclusion that russia had interfered.  the committee continues to look into all evidence to see if there was any hint of collusion,  burr said.  now, i m not even going to discuss initial findings because we haven t any. we ve got a tremendous amount of documents still to go through.  he said the panel has conducted more than 100 interviews lasting more than 250 hours in its nine month old probe, and  we currently have booked for the balance of this month 25 additional interviews.  those who have already come before committee members or investigators include the president s son in law and adviser jared kushner, former trump campaign manager paul manafort, and social media executives such as officials from twitter inc (twtr.n).  on wednesday, a representative for kushner and ivanka trump denied a report in usa today that the couple had re routed personal emails through their family s business. among witnesses who will appear at future public committee hearings are trump s personal attorney, michael cohen, and executives from facebook inc (fb.o), twitter and alphabet inc s (googl.o) google. warner and burr urged american election officials and political campaigns to take the threat of russian interference seriously.  you can t walk away from this and believe that russia s not currently active in trying to create chaos in our election process. and i assume that the same tactics that you saw in montenegro, in france, in belgium and in the united states will continue to be tested within our structure of the election process,  burr said. burr said the committee has  hit a wall  in its investigation of a former british spy s explosive dossier on purported russian support for trump s 2016 campaign. former mi6 officer christopher steele compiled the dossier, which trump was told by former fbi director james comey contained salacious material about the businessman turned president. trump and his associates have called the dossier s contents false.  we have, on several occasions, made attempts to contact mr. steele, to meet with mr. steele,  burr said.  those offers have gone unaccepted. the committee cannot really decide the credibility of the dossier without understanding things like who paid for it, who are your sources and sub sources,  burr added.

" iranian foreign minister mohammad javad zarif made an appeal for greater regional cooperation on tuesday after returning to tehran from a two day visit to oman and qatar. zarif s visit came with qatar in the midst of a row with fellow gulf cooperation council members saudi arabia, bahrain and the united arab emirates. together with egypt, they accuse qatar of supporting terrorism, a charge it denies.  we have repeatedly suggested a system of dialogue in the persian gulf, but unfortunately this has not been acknowledged by some countries, who see their future through tension, pressure and imposing on neighbors,  zarif said, according to state media. qatar calls the economic boycott a  siege  aimed at neutering an independent foreign policy it says promotes peaceful regional reform and fighting terrorism. another point of contention between qatar and its fellow gcc members is its relationship with the islamic republic. zarif said on tuesday that the economic pressure regional neighbors have put on qatar in recent months has brought about closer economic ties between doha and tehran, state media reported. zarif s discussions in oman and qatar also focused on ending the conflict in yemen as well as the situation in iraq and syria, where iran is supporting the government of president bashar al assad while qatar has funded some armed opposition groups.  with attention to the situation in syria and that in the past, we had differences with qatar; we need to have more dialogue,  zarif said, according to state media.  but the political will exists to have a broader dialogue with all countries about ending the suffering of the syrian people.  the qatari government announced it is restoring diplomatic ties with tehran in august. qatar recalled its ambassador to tehran in january last year after saudi arabia cut ties with the islamic republic, accusing it of failing to protect its embassy in tehran and consulate in mashhad against demonstrators who had ransacked them. the demonstrators were protesting saudi arabia s execution of a prominent shi ite muslim cleric convicted on terrorism charges.

" president elect donald trump will nominate republican u.s. representative mick mulvaney to be director of the white house office of management and budget, a senior transition official said on friday. an announcement naming mulvaney is expected to be made on monday, according to the wichita eagle newspaper, which first reported that the south carolina lawmaker had been chosen. his nomination must be confirmed by the republican controlled senate. mulvaney’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  the omb director plays a lead role in formulating budgets that reflect the administration’s legislative priorities and are a blueprint for detailed spending and tax bills the president wants congress to consider. mulvaney, 49, is a fiscal conservative and was an outspoken critic of former house of representatives speaker john boehner, who resigned in 2015 amid opposition from fellow republicans who were members of the house freedom caucus. david malpass, former chief economist with investment bank bear stearns and a senior trump adviser, was also considered for the omb job.

" president donald trump has won the first major battle in his war on illegal immigration, and he did it without building his wall. the victory was announced last week by the department of homeland security (dhs), which released figures showing a 93 percent drop since december of parents and children caught trying to cross the mexico border illegally.  in december, 16,000 parents and children were apprehended; in march, a month in which immigration typically increases because of temperate weather, the number was just over 1,100.  it was a remarkable decline   steeper than the 72 percent drop in overall apprehensions   but for eight dhs officials interviewed by reuters it was not surprising.  trump has spoken about the need to crack down broadly on all illegal immigrants. but, internally, according to the dhs officials familiar with the department’s strategy, his administration has focused on one immigrant group more than others: women with children, the fastest growing demographic of illegal immigrants. this planning has not been previously reported.  in the months since trump’s inauguration, dhs has rolled out a range of policies aimed at discouraging women from attempting to cross the border, including tougher initial hurdles for asylum claims and the threat of prosecuting parents if they hire smugglers to get their families across the border. the department has also floated proposals such as separating women and children at the border. dhs secretary john kelly told a senate hearing on april 5 that the sharp drop in illegal immigration, especially among women and children, was due to trump’s tough policies. to date, it has been the threat of new policies rather than their implementation that has suppressed family migration. mothers and children aren’t being separated   and dhs has shelved the plan; parents haven’t been prosecuted, and there is no wall along most of the border. yet the number of migrants trying to cross – especially women and children – has dropped drastically.  asked to comment on the policy of targeting women with children, dhs spokesman jonathan hoffman referenced the march drop, saying, “those were 15,000 women and children who did not put themselves at risk of death and assault from smugglers to make the trip north.”   the white house declined to comment and referred reuters to dhs. for months, central americans had heard about trump’s get tough policies. and public service announcements on radio and television presented bleak pictures of what awaited those who traveled north. some of the ads were funded by the united states, others by united nations agencies and regional governments. one radio ad in honduras featured a mother, saying, “it’s been a year and i don’t know if she is alive or dead. i’d do anything to have her here with me. curse the day i sent her north.” the possibility that mothers and children might be separated at the border caused particular alarm, honduran deputy foreign minister maria andrea matamoros told reuters “that worries any mother that wants to go to the united states with their kid, and being separated drastically changes their plans,” she said.  the policies targeting women and children have their roots in a working group consisting of capitol hill staffers and others called together by trump’s transition team in the weeks after the nov. 8 election. the group was asked to develop policies to discourage illegal border crossings and more quickly expel illegal immigrants after they crossed the border, according to two of the dhs officials and a congressional aide.  one goal was to help trump fulfill a major campaign promise: ending so called “catch and release,” the practice of apprehending illegal immigrants but then freeing them to live in the united states while their asylum or deportation cases were resolved.   the group quickly identified a major obstacle   the large numbers of women and children continuing to cross the border, said the dhs officials and the aide.  because a federal court ruling bars prolonged immigration detention of juveniles, the obama administration generally released mothers and children to live in the united states while awaiting resolution of their asylum or deportation cases. the incoming trump administration viewed that policy as providing encouragement for women to make the dangerous journey north with their children in tow. but the new administration was bound by the same court ruling. after kelly’s confirmation as homeland security chief in late january, several members of the original working group stepped into key roles at dhs. gene hamilton, who had worked for then republican senator jeff sessions, became senior counselor to kelly, and dimple shah, who had been staff director of the house national security subcommittee, became deputy general counsel.  kathy nuebel kovarik, formerly a staffer for republican senator chuck grassley, became policy chief at u.s. citizenship and immigration services. julie kirchner left her position as executive director of the conservative federation for american immigration reform to become a top policy adviser at u.s. customs and border protection. none of the group’s members agreed to be interviewed by reuters. several dhs officials said that in their new roles they continued to focus on the issue of women and child migrants. soon, they had the bare bones of a plan: since the court ruling on children was an obstacle to prolonged detention, why not separate them from their mothers, sending children into foster care or protective federal custody while their mothers remained in detention centers, the two dhs officials and congressional aide said. the group also advocated two other policies directly affecting mothers and children: raising the bar for asylum and prosecuting parents as human traffickers if they hired human smugglers. the thinking was that “if they can just implement tough policies for eight weeks   or even threaten to do that   they would see the numbers of families crossing just plummet,” said one dhs official familiar with the planning. on jan. 25, five days after taking office, trump issued an executive order ending “catch and release.” (a u.s. immigration and customs enforcement official said the agency still releases most women and children in compliance with the federal court order.)  a week later, in a town hall with u.s. customs and immigration services officers, chief asylum officer john lafferty outlined the possibility of separating women and children in a semi public setting for the first time, according to notes of the meeting seen by reuters. for more than a month after that meeting, the proposal did not leak, but after reuters broke news of it in early march, kelly confirmed that it was under consideration. democratic members of congress blasted the proposal, and within days it had made headlines across mexico and central america.  that month, the number of children traveling with guardians apprehended at the border fell to one third of what it had been in february.  when kelly and his advisers saw the numbers dropping, they announced they were shelving the idea of separating women and children – at least for now. asked whether it may be revived, dhs spokeswoman jenny burke said, “families caught crossing the border illegally, generally will not be separated unless the situation at the time requires it.” ",0
" hillary clinton made the prospect of her being elected the first woman u.s. president a centerpiece of her campaign, then lost a critical nominating contest to a 74 year old man in part because women preferred him. nbc news exit polls showed clinton, a former secretary of state, u.s. senator and first lady, won 44 percent of the women’s vote in tuesday’s new hampshire primary to 55 percent for her democratic party rival, u.s. senator bernie sanders. young women contributed significantly to clinton’s loss, and the candidate acknowledged that she struggled with young voters. “i know i have some work to do, particularly with young people,” clinton said during a concession speech. “even if they are not supporting me now, i support them.” with women over 45, clinton prevailed with 56 percent of the vote, abc news exit polls found, but sanders won 69 percent among women under 45. among women under 30, sanders won a staggering 82 percent. unlike barack obama, who played down his african american roots when elected the first black president eight years ago, in this election cycle clinton, 68, has emphasized the breakthrough a nov. 8 victory would represent for women. at nearly every campaign stop in new hampshire, clinton or a supporter emphasized the role she could play as the first woman in the white house while sanders galvanized young people with his promise to fix an economy he said was rigged in favor of the wealthy. clinton said she was trying to break the “hardest, highest glass ceiling.” she campaigned alongside four women u.s. senators, new hampshire governor maggie hassan and lilly ledbetter, the woman for whom an equal pay law is named.  former u.s. secretary of state madeleine albright reprised her line that “there is a special place in hell for women who don’t help each other” while introducing clinton at a rally on saturday.  clinton told a young woman the same day that she has to walk a “narrower path” because she has “got to be aware of the fact that i’m trying to be the first woman president of the united states of america, and there has never been one before, and so people don’t have, you know, an image.”  the remarks by albright, the first woman to serve as secretary of state, and others by feminist icon gloria steinem were assailed as disparaging by young women supporters of sanders. steinem had said young women were drawn to sanders because that was where the boys were. with the next nominating contests in nevada and south carolina, clinton will seek to lift her standing among women. katherine wilbur, 20, a geography major at the university of south carolina from hopkins, south carolina, said she had yet to decide on a candidate or party. “i think that’s ridiculous. it’s 2016,” wilbur said of the suggestion that women should vote for other women. “it’s not important to me.” paige lambert, 23, who volunteered for the sanders campaign in new hampshire, said she thought the remarks by steinem and albright were sexist. “i don’t think i should have to vote for a woman because i am a woman,” lambert said. “if i would have thought she’d do better, i would have voted for her. i’m not just going to vote for her because she’s a woman.”  amanda coleman, 26, of manchester, new hampshire, said she did not think candidates should be elected based on gender, but on their stances on the issues.

" president donald trump suffered another legal setback on monday as a second federal appeals court refused to revive his travel ban on people entering the united states from six muslim majority nations in a dispute headed to the u.s. supreme court. the san francisco based 9th u.s. circuit court of appeals  used narrow grounds to reject the trump administration’s bid to undo a hawaii federal judge’s decision blocking the temporary ban. it said the republican president’s march 6 order violated existing immigration law. but the three judge panel   all democratic appointees   did not address whether it was unconstitutional discrimination against muslims. a second court, the richmond, virginia based 4th u.s. circuit court of appeals, on may 25 upheld a maryland judge’s ruling that also blocked trump’s 90 day ban on travelers from libya, iran, somalia, sudan, syria and yemen.  the 4th circuit had ruled that the ban, which replaced an earlier jan. 27 one also blocked by the courts, “drips with religious intolerance, animus and discrimination” aimed at muslims. the 9th circuit largely left in place a nationwide injunction by judge derrick watson that stopped parts of the order, which trump said was urgently needed to prevent terrorism in the united states. that ruling came in a lawsuit challenging the order brought by the state of hawaii, which stated the ban would harm its universities and tourism industry. even before monday’s ruling, the case was on the fast track to the supreme court, where the administration on june 1 filed an emergency request seeking to reinstate the order and hear its appeal of the 4th circuit ruling. the supreme court could act on the administration’s request as soon as this week. trump has been on the losing side in all four court rulings on the march order. white house spokesman sean spicer said the administration is reviewing monday’s decision and expressed continued confidence that the order is fully lawful and ultimately will be upheld by the supreme court. “i think we can all attest that these are very dangerous times and we need every available tool at our disposal to prevent terrorists from entering the united states and committing acts of bloodshed and violence,” spicer told a briefing. the 9th circuit upheld the block on trump’s three month travel ban for the six countries and four month suspension of all refugee admissions. but the court pared back part of watson’s injunction in order to allow the government to conduct internal reviews on vetting procedures for these travelers. the administration said the travel ban was needed to allow time to implement stronger vetting measures, although it has already rolled out some new requirements not blocked by courts, including additional questions for visa applicants. rather than focusing on trump campaign statements as the virginia based court did, the 9th circuit said the language in the executive order itself did not make a rational case for why a travel ban was needed. “the order does not offer a sufficient justification to suspend the entry of more than 180 million people on the basis of nationality,” the court wrote, referring the combined populations of the six countries.  under immigration law, the administration was required to make findings that entry of the people in question would be detrimental to the united states but failed to do so, the court said. stephen vladeck, a professor at university of texas school of law, said the 9th circuit provided an easier path for the supreme court to keep the travel ban on hold, because it avoided entirely the controversy over trump’s campaign statements.  “it provides a very attractive way to leave the injunction in place without setting broader doctrinal rules about which they may have pause,” vladeck said. trump during the 2016 presidential campaign called for a “total and complete shutdown of muslims entering the united states.” monday was the deadline for the ban’s challengers to respond to the administration’s request that the order be allowed to go into effect. the american civil liberties union, which represents people challenging the ban in the separate maryland suit handled by the 4th circuit, filed court papers urging the court not to take up the case, saying the order will become moot on wednesday, 90 days from when trump issued it. lawyers for hawaii called the order a “thinly veiled muslim ban.” trump’s earlier jan. 27 order also included iraq among the countries targeted and a total ban on refugees from syria. the march order was intended to overcome the legal issues posed by the original ban, but was blocked before it could go into effect on march 16. the suits by hawaii and the maryland challengers argued that the order violated federal immigration law and a section of the constitution’s first amendment that prohibits the government from favoring or disfavoring any particular religion. hawaii’s court papers mentioned a series of trump twitter posts on june 5. trump described the order as a “watered down, politically correct” version of his original one.

" with golf long regarded as a stern measure of character and a natural setting for deal making, u.s. president donald trump and japanese prime minister shinzo abe’s weekend outing in florida could be viewed as more than a leisurely bonding exercise between two world leaders. u.s. president trump and japanese prime minister abe will form a twosome for their round of golf on saturday, presumably at the trump international golf club near his mar a lago resort in palm beach. details are still under wraps.  trump told a local sports radio station last weekend golf was a better way to get to know someone than lunch and saw his match up with abe as a “fun” meeting between partners rather than adversaries.  abe might feel the occasion carries more weight. his prime minister grandfather, nobusuke kishi, and u.s. president dwight eisenhower played near washington in 1957, a round newspapers described as a “triumph of diplomacy” between former world war two enemies. abe teed off the latest round of golf diplomacy in november, giving trump an expensive, gold colored driver during their meeting at trump tower in manhattan, where he sought assurances about the future strength of the decades old alliance between the two nations. with anxiety over trump’s tough talk on currency, security and trade with japan, some in tokyo have expressed concern abe might be too generous in any haggling on the fairways when pitted against the real estate mogul and author of “the art of the deal”. in purely a golfing sense, abe is likely to find trump a formidable opponent. “he is pretty remarkable for a 70 year old guy,” jaime diaz, editor in chief of golf world and a senior writer for golf digest, told reuters. “as i understand it, his handicap is 2.8. that seems a little low but i think he is very capable of playing to a five or six handicap. “he is a legitimate good player. it’s not a ‘trumped up’ claim that he is somebody who shoots in the 70s.” trump says he has won 18 club trophies and said such a winning pedigree made him the ideal man to run the country during the election race. “see how beautiful my hands are, look at those hands. those are powerful hands,” trump said at a detroit rally last year during the republican primaries. “(they can) hit a golf ball 285 yards.” retired boxer oscar de la hoya questioned trump’s trustworthiness on the golf course while speaking to reporters in las vegas in may 2016 during the build up to the wbc middleweight title clash between canelo alvarez and amir khan, according to the ap. hollywood actor samuel l. jackson did the same in an interview he did with united airlines’ rhapsody magazine in january 2016. reuters could not independently confirm these accounts. after the jackson interview, trump issued a tweet that said in part: “i don’t cheat at golf.” the white house did not return a request for comment on the cheating allegations.  diaz who has twice played with trump, at trump national golf club charlotte in north carolina in 2013 and more recently at the doral resort in florida, described the president as someone who would not need to resort to cheating to beat most players. “i know he has won all these club championships at golf courses that he owns and a lot of people are suspect about that. but he would be a tough guy to beat with a five handicap,” the golf writer said. “he addresses the ball with good body language ... confident and flowing and fluid. he just looks like he is going to hit a good shot.” it is far harder to find allegations of cheating or boastfulness directed at the more circumspect abe, who is a member of the ultra exclusive three hundred club in kanagawa prefecture, south west of tokyo. the club, confined to only 300 members, charges some 70 80 million yen ($625,000 $715,000) for membership fees and 50,000 yen for green fees. the 62 year old abe takes the game very seriously and local media have reported that rounds with his wife can get tense if he is playing poorly. “when he is playing golf, he concentrates. so everyone else becomes intense as well,” a company president who plays abe once or twice a year, told reuters on condition of anonymity. he was unsure of abe’s handicap but confirmed reports that the prime minister usually shoots between 90 and 100 over 18 holes, which would place him squarely in the field of average weekend hackers. a straight driver with a “stable” game all round, abe is generally smartly turned out, sometimes in short pants and knee socks and always with a baseball cap on his head. “i was impressed that abe holds the flag on the green, while other players are putting,” the source said. “people in a high position like him do not have to do that for others. he is very polite.” the conservative politician is not so reserved as

" a senior israeli minister on thursday declined to comment on reports that israeli aircraft had struck a target in syria the night before but repeated a threat to hit arms shipments to lebanese hezbollah guerrillas. the air strike targeted a factory south of the syrian city of homs on wednesday night and the syrian army responded by firing a surface to air missile at the aircraft, a commander in a military alliance fighting in support of damascus said. an israeli military spokeswoman declined to comment, but israel s channel 10 said the aircraft were not hit and returned safely to base.  i can t, of course, relate to reports about the israel defence forces  attack in syria, but regardless, israel s position is clear: smuggling arms to hezbollah is a red line in our eyes,  intelligence minister israel katz told army radio. syria s foreign ministry called on the united nations security council to condemn israel s attack, state run sana news agency reported. the foreign ministry asked the security council to take  strict and immediate  measures to stop such israeli attacks, it said, adding that the strike hit a copper factory in the industrial town of hisya, 35 km (21 miles) south of homs and 112 km (70 miles) north of damascus. the statement did not give details of any casualties. the syrian observatory for human rights, a britain based organization that reports on the war, said the air strike had targeted a military installation.  israel has acted in the past and it will act in the future to prevent arms smuggling to hezbollah according to intelligence information that we will have,  said katz, who is a member of prime minister benjamin netanyahu s inner circle of ministers. he said israel s  red line  was  against arms smuggling (and) also against iran s consolidation in syria  and that it was  prepared to act to deter against our responses.   i think the other side also understands this clearly and actions that took place in the past for which we did take responsibility, were actions that were according to these lines, these red lines,  katz added. the israeli air force says it has struck arms convoys of the syrian military and its lebanese ally, the iran backed hezbollah, nearly 100 times in recent years. israeli officials have expressed alarm at iranian influence in syria, where iran backed groups have played a critical role fighting in support of president bashar al assad during the conflict that erupted in 2011. iran s military chief, general mohammad baqeri, warned israel against breaching syrian airspace and territory during a visit to damascus last month. tensions between israel and hezbollah, which last fought a major conflict in 2006, have escalated this year. each side has warned it will unleash devastating firepower in the event of a full scale war.

" the vatican said on wednesday it was worried about u.s. president donald trump’s moves on immigration, in the holy see’s first comment since his executive order banning travel into the united states by citizens of seven majority muslim countries. “certainly there is worry because we are messengers of another culture, that of openness,” the vatican’s deputy secretary of state, archbishop angelo becciu, told an italian catholic television station in answer to a question about trump’s order. becciu, who ranks third in the vatican hierarchy, was asked about the executive order as well as trump’s promise to build a wall on the u.s. border with mexico. “pope francis, in fact, insists on the ability to integrate those who arrive in our societies and cultures,” he told tv2000. some roman catholic leaders in the united states have criticized trump’s executive order. cardinal blase cupich of chicago said on sunday it was “a dark moment in u.s. history” and that it was “contrary to both catholic and american values”. last february, while returning from a trip to mexico, pope francis said then candidate trump’s view about building walls was “not christian”.

" ukrainian president petro poroshenko dismissed a russian proposal to deploy u.n. peacekeepers in eastern ukraine as an effort to legalize its proxies and freeze the conflict.  relations between kiev and moscow have never been worse since russia annexed crimea more than three years ago and russian backed separatist fighters subsequently took up arms against ukrainian government forces in the east of the country. russian president vladimir putin this month suggested armed u.n. peacekeepers be deployed to eastern ukraine to help protect ceasefire monitors from the organization for security and cooperation in europe (osce) and to help end a conflict between ukrainian troops and russia backed separatists, which has killed more than 10,000 people since 2014. poroshenko used his speech at the annual gathering of world leaders for the united nations general assembly to accuse moscow of not contributing to international security, but of being its  biggest threat.   the latest hybrid peacekeeping proposal from moscow is yet another example of russia s real ambition to legalize its proxies and freeze the conflict forever,  he said.  we remain confident that a fully fledged peacekeeping operation is the only viable solution to de escalate and protect the people of ukraine.   putin originally said the peacekeepers should be deployed along the line of contact between ukrainian government forces and pro russian separatists, but later said they could also be deployed in other areas where osce inspectors work.    the peacekeepers  mandate should cover the entire occupied area, including the ukrainian russian state border. this is the must. as long as the border is used as the main supply route for manpower and weapons to donbass there will be no peace in my country,  he said.  kiev and western countries accuse russia of providing military backing to the insurgency in eastern ukraine. russia denies any direct role in the conflict. efforts to broker an end to fighting through the so called minsk agreements have so far failed. violence continues with attempted ceasefires repeatedly broken. western powers fear peace efforts could unravel.  the key problem in donbass is that ukraine and russia strive for different things,  poroshenko said.  ukraine wants peace and restoration of its sovereign territory, but russia wants control of ukraine and undermines every effort (to get)  our sovereign control on ukraine s border.  ukraine s alternative plan would ban any russian nationals from taking part in a peacekeeping mission which it wants deployed along the part of its border with russia which it does not control, an idea moscow has so far balked at.

" thousands of people have made donations to planned parenthood in the name of vice president elect mike pence, an abortion opponent, so that he will receive official acknowledgements from the women’s health care provider, the group said on tuesday. the idea of making donations in pence’s name arose and spread on social media as a protest after republican donald trump won his bid for the u.s. presidency in a surprise victory last week. both trump and pence, his running mate, have pledged to curtail women’s rights to abortion. trump said the u.s. supreme court ruling roe v wade legalizing abortion should be overturned and that he would appoint an anti abortion justice to the nation’s highest court.  trump also said women who had abortions should be punished but later said it was doctors who perform abortions who should be punished. pence, whose home state of indiana has restrictive laws regulating access to abortion, has pushed for congress to defund the nonprofit planned parenthood, which performs some abortions. a number of celebrities have publicized the donation campaign in pence’s name with posts on social media, including emmy award winning comedian amy schumer and actresses ashley hinshaw, jaime perry and amber tamblyn. they said their donations to planned parenthood included the address of pence’s office in indiana so it would get the acknowledgement that planned parenthood mails to donors. at least 20,000 people who have donated money since the u.s. election on nov. 8 named pence as donor, out of 160,000 people overall, a planned parenthood spokesman told the thomson reuters foundation. planned parenthood has reported a surge in donations and demand for long acting contraceptives since trump’s election. pence signed a law this year that would have banned abortions due to genetic abnormality, criminalized collection of fetal tissue for research, required fetal tissue be buried or cremated and made women look at their fetal ultrasounds before getting an abortion. a federal judge blocked the law in june. pence’s office did not respond to a request for comment. planned parenthood, which has more than 650 health centers nationwide, relies on public funding for about 40 percent of its funding. private donations comprise about one quarter of its revenue, it said in its 2016 annual report.

" a moscow backed congress of all syria s ethnic groups may take place in russia and begin working on a new constitution as early as next month, the news agency ria reported on monday, citing a source familiar with the situation. the congress, which president vladimir putin first mentioned earlier this month, may take place in mid november at russia s  black sea resort of sochi, ria said. the idea of a congress had united nations backing, a senior russian negotiator on syria said. russia s hmeymim air base in syria also might be used, he added.  this matter is still being discussed,  alexander lavrentyev, the head of the russian delegation at syria talks in kazakhstan, told reporters between meetings with diplomats from turkey and iran.  as you know (u.n. special representative on syria staffan) de mistura has in principle supported the idea of holding the congress,  lavrentyev said.  although he had some reservations, he supported this initiative of russia.  lavrentyev said the congress would focus on seeking  compromise solutions towards the political settlement  of the syrian conflict. russia, turkey and iran are holding the seventh round of talks on syria   which are separate from the u.n. sponsored geneva process   in astana, the capital of kazakhstan, this week.

" near the end of his eight years as louisiana governor, bobby jindal, a tax slashing conservative and presidential hopeful, acknowledged that the state’s business tax breaks had gone too far. “the truth is, we have a system of corporate welfare,” jindal said during an april speech to legislators. the comment resonates now as the state faces its worst budget crisis in three decades   largely because of the soaring cost of subsidies, as well as personal income tax cuts, championed by jindal. business tax subsidies peaked in 2012, when the state exempted 88 percent of corporate income taxes, or about $1.8 billion. it has exceeded 80 percent since then, according to the louisiana department of revenue. for a graphic showing how corporate tax exemptions soared as state revenue fell, see tmsnrt.rs/1t7qbm9 plummeting oil prices dealt the latest blow to state revenues. deficits are projected at $940 million for the fiscal year ending june 30 and about $2 billion for next year.  “it’s gotten pretty bad, pretty rapidly,” said the state legislature’s chief economist, greg albrecht, who believes louisiana is heading into a recession. jindal has kept a low profile since leaving office in january and could not be reached for comment. in a january speech, he highlighted efforts to cut government and stimulate the economy without raising taxes. “you look at the projects — the employers coming in and those who are expanding — we’ve seen tremendous progress,” he said.  in 2008, when jindal became governor at 36, he was a rising gop star, often mentioned as a potential presidential candidate. he cultivated that image, staking his political fortunes on a platform of slashing taxes, dismantling big government and attracting business.  the next year, jindal helped push through legislation to cut personal income taxes and worked to enhance louisiana’s already robust corporate tax breaks.  in july of 2009, he signed bills that created or expanded nine tax credits to sectors including film, port cargo and infrastructure. the credits are typically worth 20 to 40 percent of a company’s in state spending, or in some cases spending on payroll or research. in all, annual corporate tax exemptions rose during jindal’s term by about $1 billion, to $1.96 billion in 2014, according to state data. his tax cutting hit a wall in 2013 when he failed to convince a republican controlled legislature to abolish personal and business income taxes. “he really wanted to go to a national stage, run for president, and say he repealed the personal income tax,” said robert travis scott, president of the public affairs research council, a nonpartisan organization. many of jindal’s political successes had consequences for louisiana’s budget. a state commissioned study found that film tax credits, for example, cost the state an estimated $171 million in 2014.  “the state ends up with the short end of the stick,” said loren scott, author of the study, which also found some economic benefits.  among the biggest beneficiaries of louisiana subsidies is the petrochemical industry. one massive project under construction in southwestern louisiana   sempra energy’s $6 billion liquefied natural gas processing complex and export terminal   will receive a $2.2 billion property tax break over a decade, records show. the plant will create 130 permanent jobs with average salaries of $80,000, records show. the california based company also got rebates on some payroll costs and a capital investment tax credit. louisiana’s subsidies are getting more scrutiny in the budget crisis. democratic governor john bel edwards, who took office in january, has proposed cutting incentives but faces resistance from republican legislators and business groups. “the previous administration,” edwards said, “blew a hole in our state budget by writing checks for tax credits, rebates, or refunds to corporations with no consideration of whether louisiana receives a good return on our investment.” jindal advisor curt anderson said the subsidies resulted in new jobs and higher wages.  “his decision to shrink the government and grow the private sector economy was purposeful.”  business groups continue to support the incentives, saying they are invaluable to the state economy.  “in terms of economic development, jindal was an outstanding governor,” said michael hecht, president of greater new orleans inc. “corporations are being scapegoated.” falling oil prices and personal income tax cuts also played major roles in the crisis, according to state data. oil related revenues are projected to drop by nearly $400 million this fiscal year, the data shows. personal income tax breaks pushed by jindal and predecessor, democrat kathleen blanco, reduced revenues by about $800 million annually, said albrecht, the state economist. most louisiana business subsidy programs preceded the jindal administration, but their use and cost shot up during his tenure, said jan moller, director of the nonpartisan louisiana budget project. the governor, he said, directed state economic development officials to “aggressively pursue companies and give them as many incentives as possible.” as louisiana faced mounting shortfalls, jindal sought solutions that didn’t involve raising taxes.  “despite the fact that the state was hemorrhaging money, he just wanted to keep his tax virginity” for his presidential campaign, said edward chervenak, a political science professor at the university of new orleans, echoing a theme common among democrats and republicans alike in the state. having signed a pledge not to raise taxes, jindal turned to one time fixes, such as offering tax amnesty to delinquent taxpayers and raiding state trust funds. that included drawing down $520 million from the medicaid trust fund for the elderly and $540 million from a reserve fund for state employee healthcare, according to republican state treasurer john kennedy. jindal failed last year to sell the state’s tobacco settlement, worth $1.2 billion over time, for an upfront lump sum of $750 million   a move kennedy compared to “a junkie selling his tv or smartphone to buy another fix.” lawmakers now face tough choices. healthcare and education budgets   particularly colleges   already have been slashed and could see more cuts. and legislators are considering raising sales taxes by up to 2 cents.  state representative julie stokes, a republican from the new orleans suburb of kenner, said her gop colleagues have been reluctant to raise taxes, and she understands. “look, i don’t want to talk about it   i’m a conservative republican from a conservative republican district,” she said. “but i just feel like we’ve got to lose the talking points and have an honest dialogue.” ",0
" cuba took another step on sunday toward the end of the castro era, with millions of residents placing paper ballots in cardboard boxes for ward delegates to municipal assemblies. the vote comes the day after the first anniversary of revolutionary leader fidel castro s death and precedes another election early next year for provincial and national assembly deputies. the new national assembly, where 50 percent of the deputies must be ward delegates elected on sunday, is expected on feb. 24 to select a new president to replace raul castro, fidel s 86 year old younger brother, who has said he will step down after serving two five year terms. the castro brothers have headed the government since the 1959 revolution. raul castro will remain head of the communist party until 2021, the only legal party in cuba. nearly 27,000 candidates are running for 12,515 ward positions in sunday s election, the only part of the electoral process that is contested publicly and with direct participation by ordinary cubans. the results will be announced on monday. the candidates for the provincial and national assemblies are nominated by commissions composed of representatives of communist party controlled organizations, such as the trade union federation, then presented as a slate for a public vote. those slates have had the same number of names as seats in previous elections. fifty percent of those names must be ward delegates. the electoral cycle comes at a tricky time for the caribbean nation as the revolutionary generation passes, an economic reform program appears stalled, aid from key ally venezuela shrinks, and the trump administration threatens. yet candidates debated none of these issues before sunday s vote. first vice president miguel diaz canel, who is expected to succeed castro, lauded the electoral process and refused to speculate about his future.  today is a day to talk about what we are doing and fidel,  he told reporters after casting his ballot. asked about relations with the united states, he said cuba remained interested in improving them, but reiterated its position that negotiations would have to be based on mutual respect and equality and without dictates.  the future depends on them, not us,  he said. campaigning is prohibited in cuba, and candidates for the ward posts were nominated at neighborhood meetings based on their personal merits, not policy positions. they need not belong to the communist party, and many candidates are independents, but only a few government opponents have ever competed.  i am happy to vote, but i must say, like most young people i do not think it makes any difference,  said a young woman, who requested anonymity because she holds an important government job. she added that there was an ongoing discussion on how to reform the electoral process and make government more responsive. this year a coalition of opposition groups ran more than 160 pre candidates, but most were blocked by state security from nomination meetings, and none are running on sunday.

" india has stepped up its lobbying effort against moves in the u. s. congress to impose curbs on visas for skilled workers that threaten the south asian nation’s tech sector, which employs more than 3.5 million people. speaking to reuters, trade minister nirmala sitharaman said new delhi had reached out to the administration of president donald trump to stress the importance of india’s $150 billion it services industry to u.s. citizens.  “india’s investments in the united states have provided jobs to u.s. citizens,” she said in an interview. “that has to be brought to the notice of the u.s. administration.” the comments come days after prime minister narendra modi urged washington to keep an open mind on admitting skilled indian workers. indian software companies such as tata consultancy services, infosys ltd and wipro ltd shot to prominence in the 1990s by helping western firms stamp out the “y2k” bug. trump’s “america first” rhetoric on jobs, however, has put their biggest market under threat.  a bill was introduced in the u.s. congress last month to more than double the minimum salary of h 1b visa holders, which could significantly boost costs for it companies, whose margins are already being squeezed. new delhi has backed a move by nasscom, india’s high tech industry association, to lobby u.s. lawmakers and companies to urge the administration not to crack down on allowing its skilled workers into the united states. a nasscom delegation is now in the united states to make its case to officials on capitol hill and in the white house.   “we will have to engage with the new administration,” sitharaman said. “our engagement at every level is intact and continuing.” the united states is india’s biggest trading partner, but trade in goods between the two countries has been stagnant, at around $67 billion, for the last three years. indian software exports to the u.s. rose more than 10 percent, to $37 billion, in the last fiscal year from a year earlier. indian nationals are by far the largest group of recipients of the 65,000 h 1b visas issued annually to new applicants under a cap mandated by congress. more than 60 percent of the u.s. employees of infosys hold h 1b visas. a global pact on services trade would go a long way towards settling disputes over professional visas, sitharaman said.  “if only there is a framework...you will know how movement can happen and how certain restrictions can or cannot come,” she said. “it’s time for countries to sit together and look at it.” ",0
" if the u.s. supreme court in the coming days decides a high profile immigration case in favor of the obama administration, the ruling could have an unexpected beneficiary: republican presidential contender donald trump.   the obama administration is asking the high court to revive its 2014 proposal to protect up to 4 million people from deportation, a plan that was blocked by lower courts. the court could rule that a president has broad authority to interpret and enforce federal immigration law.  such a ruling would allow obama to implement his signature executive action on immigration, aimed at the parents of u.s. citizens’ children, before he leaves office. it could also help trump, who has put forth his own sweeping and controversial plans on immigration ahead of the nov. 8 election. “to the extent the court has language about the president’s wide authority in immigration law generally, that would certainly strengthen trump’s hand.” said stephen yale loehr, an immigration law expert at cornell law school. the supreme court’s ruling will come at a key phase in the presidential election cycle, with candidates trump and his democratic rival hillary clinton trading jabs over immigration policy following the mass shooting in a orlando nightclub in which a gunman killed 49 people.  trump has proposed curbing immigration from countries with a history of terrorism, blocking the entry of muslims and deporting the estimated 11 million people in the united states who entered the country illegally.  if he wins the race for the white house, trump might need to invoke his own executive authority   as happened with obama   if the u.s. congress does not approve his proposals, which have sparked outrage at home and abroad. the current case is unlikely to provide any support for trump’s  proposal to bar muslims, which legal experts say would face other legal hurdles because it targets people on the basis of religion. but legal experts say it could help trump if he seeks to block entry from certain countries under a provision of immigration law that gives the president the power to suspend entry of noncitizens whose entry “would be detrimental to the interests of the united states.”  that provision has previously only been used block entry of small groups of people, such as officials linked with foreign governments hostile to the united states. applying it to entire countries could prompt a similar lawsuit to the one filed against obama. clinton could also seize on an obama victory in the case, but her own immigration proposals are more modest. she has said that absent action by congress to reform the system entirely, she would keep obama’s program in place and seek to expand on it. under the u.s. constitution, congress passes laws and the executive branch enforces them. in the immigration context, congress has traditionally given the president considerable leeway to interpret how to implement the laws. the high court, evenly split 4 4 between liberals and conservatives following the death of justice antonin scalia in february, could decide the case on narrower grounds than the broad question of executive power.  it could avoid touching on immigration law at all by finding that the states challenging obama’s proposal did not have legal standing to sue. the court could also split 4 4, which would leave in place the lower court decision blocking the plan but without setting any legal precedent.     u.s. presidents generally have discretion to enforce immigration law, but the plan’s challengers said obama exceeded the limits of his authority by setting up a program that would allow millions to gain temporary legal status and work permits.  critics say his plan was unlawful in part because it effectively granted relief from deportation to a much bigger class of people than had ever benefited from any similar programs in the past. texas and 25 other states who filed suit said it was an unconstitutional abuse of power. obama’s lawyers told the supreme court that obama was acting within the government’s exercise of prosecutorial discretion to decide who to deport.

" u.s. democratic presidential candidate hillary clinton will call for higher trade standards at a saturday campaign stop in youngstown, ohio, to ensure that automakers that use largely foreign parts are not given preference for producing “made in america” cars. her campaign said clinton will tell supporters she will take a stand against weak “rules of origin” and will say the pending trans pacific partnership, a trade compact with 12 nations, is not stringent enough. the tpp, which is being finalized by the obama administration, sets the content threshold for “made in america” cars at 45 percent. clinton has said she opposes the tpp because it does not do enough to protect u.s. workers. international trade deals have become a flash point in the u.s. presidential race.

" the united states is not ruling out the eventual possibility of direct talks with north korea, deputy secretary of state john j. sullivan said on tuesday, hours after pyongyang warned nuclear war might break out at any moment. talks between the adversaries have long been urged by china in particular, but washington and its ally japan have been reluctant to sit down at the table while pyongyang continues to pursue a goal of developing a nuclear tipped missile capable of hitting the united states.  eventually, we don t rule out the possibility of course of direct talks,  sullivan said in tokyo after talks with his japanese counterpart.   our focus is on diplomacy to solve this problem that is presented by the dprk. we must, however, with our allies, japan and south korea and elsewhere, be prepared for the worst, should diplomacy fail,  he said. dprk stands for north korea s official name, the democratic people s republic of korea. in washington, state department spokeswoman heather nauert highlighted u.s. diplomatic efforts by sullivan and others to pressure north korea to give up its weapons programmes by  encouraging implementation of international sanctions. nauert told a regular briefing that sanctions were choking off money supply to north korea and it was feeling the effect,  but even so pyongyang was  not showing that they are anywhere near desiring to have talks.   we hope that this diplomatic approach will be successful in the end,  nauert said, while adding of secretary of state rex tillerson:  he s got to be the most optimistic guy in the u.s. government.  tension has soared following a series of weapons tests by north korea and a string of increasingly bellicose exchanges between u.s. president donald trump and north korean leader kim jong un. leaflets, apparently from north korea, calling trump a  mad dog  and depicting gruesome images of him have turned up across central seoul, adding an unusually personal element to north korean propaganda.  the situation on the korean peninsula where the attention of the whole world is focused has reached the touch and go point and a nuclear war may break out any moment,  north korea s deputy u.n. ambassador kim in ryong told a u.n. general assembly committee on monday.  as long as one does not take part in the u.s. military actions against the dprk (north korea), we have no intention to use or threaten to use nuclear weapons against any other country,  according to kim s prepared remarks for the discussion on nuclear weapons. kim did not read that section out loud. south korea and the united states began week long joint naval drills in the waters around the korean peninsula on monday, involving about 40 ships from both militaries, including the nuclear powered uss ronald reagan aircraft carrier, south korea s defense ministry said. north korean state media said on tuesday the allies   desperate efforts  to block north korea s advance only showed  it should continue its nuclear program  to the last.    the dprk has been fully ready for all the u.s. is resorting to, including sanctions, pressure and military option, as it has the tremendous nuclear force for self defence and irresistible strength of self reliance and self development,  the official kcna news agency said in a commentary. asked about the north korean envoy s warning of nuclear war, chinese foreign ministry spokesman lu kang said it would not be in anyone s interest.  china still hopes that all parties, in this situation where things on the korean peninsula are highly complex and sensitive, can exercise restraint and do more to benefit the lowering of tensions in the region,  lu told a daily news briefing. the u.n. security council has ratcheted up sanctions on north korea over its nuclear and ballistic missile programmes since 2006.  the most recent u.n. sanctions banned exports of coal, iron ore and seafood, aimed at cutting off a third of the north s total annual exports of $3 billion. experts say north korea has been scrambling to find alternative sources of hard currency to keep its economy afloat and advance its weapons program.  on monday, the head of cyber intelligence at bae systems plc (baes.l) said north korea s lazarus hacking group was probably responsible for a recent cyber heist in taiwan. taiwan s central news agency said last week that hackers had sought to steal some $60 million from the far eastern bank, but it had recovered all but $500,000. bae systems and others have previously linked lazarus to an $81 million cyber heist at bangladesh s central bank last year. north korea has recently allowed citizens as young as 12 to bet on horse races for the first time as the country scrambles to unearth new sources of hard currency amid intensifying international sanctions.  punters had previously risked three years  hard labor for gambling in the tightly controlled state, but the growing importance of private markets means more people have money to spend on leisure, experts said. lee sang keun, a researcher at the institute of unification studies at seoul s ewha womans university, said wealthy north koreans had to pay for such activities with chinese or u.s. currency.   many north koreans make lots of money from the market, dine at hamburger restaurants and go shopping, all of which help fatten regime coffers. that s

" mylan nl chief executive officer heather bresch will appear at a sept. 21 congressional hearing over price increases for its epipen emergency allergy treatment, the u.s. house of representatives oversight committee said in a statement on wednesday. mylan has been widely criticized, including by u.s. democratic presidential candidate hillary clinton, for sharply raising the price of epipens, which are carried by people with life threatening allergies. mylan, which acquired the product in 2007, recently raised the list price for a pair of epipen auto injectors to $600. the price has been rising from a cost of about $100 in 2008.  mylan spokeswoman nina devlin confirmed that bresch will attend the hearing. “heather is very good at being able to give an answer without offering much information,” said evercore isi analyst umer raffat, adding that he will be watching for any other issues that might be raised by the committee.  a probe into epipen pricing by a u.s. senate subcommittee was announced on sept. 7. bresch is the daughter of u.s. senator joe manchin, a democrat from west virginia. the house panel co chairmen, republican representative jason chaffetz and democratic representative elijah cummings, noted there is “... justified outrage from families and schools across the country struggling to afford the high cost of epipens.” the committee planned to look at how to spur competition in the epipen market and speed approval by the food and drug administration (fda) of generic alternatives, according to the statement. in response to the furor, mylan last month said it would sell its own generic version of epipen for $300. teva pharmaceutical industries, which for years has been working on developing a generic alternative to epipen, said last week that it hopes to gain u.s. approval by late 2017 or early 20018. epipen, which has annual sales of about $1 billion, delivers a potentially life saving dose of epinephrine by injection into the thigh to counter dangerous allergic reactions, including to peanuts and bee stings. mylan owns 94 percent of the market for such auto injected devices. the committee said it also planned to call as a witness dr doug throckmorton, the fda’s deputy director at the center for drug evaluation and research.

" the u.s. senate confirmed former utah governor jon huntsman on thursday to be president donald trump s ambassador to russia, sending an experienced diplomat to fill the crucial post in moscow. the senate confirmed huntsman, who also served as ambassador to china under former democratic president barack obama, by voice vote. huntsman served as ambassador to singapore under former republican president george h.w. bush. the senate foreign relations committee had approved huntsman unanimously earlier this week, as members from both parties praised his qualifications and experience. the senate also confirmed three other diplomatic positions by voice vote: john bass, currently the u.s. ambassador to turkey, to be envoy to afghanistan; career diplomat justin siberell to be ambassador to bahrain and wess mitchell, a think tank founder, to be assistant secretary of state for european and eurasian affairs. huntsman takes on the post in moscow as congressional committees and special counsel robert mueller investigate allegations that russia sought to influence the 2016 u.s. presidential election on trump s behalf, as well as potential collusion with moscow by trump associates. moscow denies such activity and trump dismisses any talk of collusion. huntsman said at his confirmation hearing that there was no question russia interfered during the 2016 campaign.

" u.s. treasury secretary steven mnuchin said on thursday that the trump administration’s upcoming tax plan will not be aimed at lowering income taxes for the wealthiest americans. “”we are looking for a middle income tax cut. on the high end the plan is to eliminate state and local deductions ... and even if we do end up with a slight reduction on the high end that will be offset by a reduction of deductions so their taxes won’t go down,” mnuchin said during an interview at a policy forum organized by news outlet politico. he added that details of the tax reform framework, due for release the week of sept. 25,  would include a specific rate proposal for the corporate tax rate. “you’re going to see a specific rate proposal in that,” mnuchin said, adding it would also include details on deduction of corporate interest.

" russia should scrap the 13 percent profit tax on funds repatriated from abroad and renew an amnesty from penalties for businesses returning capital, as washington moves toward tougher sanctions, president vladimir putin said on monday. amid huge capital outflows in 2014, deteriorating relations with the west over the ukraine conflict and weak oil prices, moscow offered the amnesty for those returning capital to russia.  the amnesty, which expired in mid 2016, scrapped responsibility for past taxes and currency violations for those who declared assets abroad. but few agreed to take part in the amnesty. russian finance minister anton siluanov said on friday that his ministry was proposing such an amnesty be restored in 2018 for at least a year. speaking at the meeting with the leadership of the russian parliament, putin said he had two proposals which he had not previously spoken about publicly.  the first is to extend the amnesty timeline, i mean external restrictions are not easing, but, on the contrary, tending to rise,  he said. u.s. president donald trump signed into law a new package of sanctions in august. one provision asked the u.s. treasury secretary to submit a report on the impact of expanding sanctions to cover russian sovereign debt, with an outcome expected as early as february. putin s second proposal was to scrap 13 percent taxes for transfers of capital to russia by businesses. among other tools to encourage the return of money will be a special bonds program.  russia plans to adjust the terms of a sovereign eurobond issue next year so that businesses can use the bonds to repatriate funds in a way that would protect them from being damaged by new sanctions on moscow. reuters reported earlier this month that wealthy russians facing the prospect of targeted u.s. sanctions next year had floated the idea of a special treasury bond to help create favorable conditions for them to bring their cash home.

" ever since north korea lobbed two missiles far above this windswept fishing town on japan s northern island of hokkaido, seaweed farmer mitsuyo kawamura says she s been on edge.  now when i hear a loud sound, i look outside, i look out at the ocean,  68 year old kawamura said from her seaside cottage in erimo, where she lays out long dark strands of kombu seaweed on stones to dry in the sun.  i feel anxious, like i never know when it will come again.  as japan prepares to vote in sunday s national election,   prime minister shinzo abe has called north korea s escalating threats   it also conducted a sixth nuclear test last month   a  national crisis  that only he can lead japan through. yet the missiles that flew over erimo on aug. 29 and sept. 15 created an eerie threat: no one saw or heard them. they streaked by several hundred kilometers above land, too high to see with the naked eye, before splashing into the pacific more than 1,000 kilometers (600 miles) to the east.  warnings of the missiles spread through sirens and government issued  j alerts  on millions of cell phones throughout japan, jolting some out of sleep. kawamura has since stocked up on extra food and keeps the radio on to listen for more warnings. like many residents here   and across japan   she feels helpless, unsure of how to protect herself.  when it s launched, it could land here just moments later,  she said.  there s nowhere to hide.  abe s rhetoric has grown harsher as north korea has threatened to  sink  japan and seems intent on developing nuclear warheads that can reach the u.s. mainland. he has repeatedly backed u.s. president donald trump s  all options on the table  stance and says now is not the time for dialogue.  they promised in 1994 and again in 2005 that they would abandon their nuclear program. but they have broken their word and developed nuclear devices and missiles,  abe said at a campaign rally last week.  we re not going to be deceived anymore.  to protect itself, japan has deployed 34 patriot pac 3 anti missile batteries around the country, including one in hokkaido, and aegis defense systems on several destroyers. u.s. forces in japan also have ballistic missile defense equipment that can   if all goes well   take out a missile in mid flight. the rockets thrust tiny erimo, population 4,850, into the global spotlight. maps on tv broadcasts showed the missiles  flight paths over nearby cape erimo, a jagged point that juts into the pacific where seals frolic. at the town s docks, where fishermen sorted through the morning s haul of salmon, tossing them into vats of ice water, strong support for abe was mixed with worries that he s too strident, putting japan at risk.  right now, no one s better than abe,  said satoru narita, a 72 year old fisherman. if anything, japan has been too passive, said 23 year old ryosuke kinoshita, who supports abe s ruling liberal democratic party.  next time they launch one, i d almost like to see us fire one back,  he said.  we can t live in peace and safety.  but haruki suminoya, head of erimo s fishing union, cautioned that being overly aggressive could provoke north korea  into lashing out.  abe s approach is too strong, too hardline,  he said.  a more restrained approach is better.  the recent war of words between trump and north korea unsettled many residents, who pointed out they were a much closer target than the united states. while pressure was needed toward north korea, being too tough could be disastrous, said mayor masaki ohnishi.  if north korea does something serious, japan is within shooting range.  so far, it seems that abe is winning over voters. nationwide polls show the ldp is headed for a big win this weekend. erimo residents were divided on abe s signature policy of  revising japan s war renouncing constitution to clarify the status of the country s military. critics worry that it could lead to an expanded role for the armed forces overseas and entangle it in u.s. led conflicts. but shinto priest hirotaka tezuka, 39, said the constitution had grown outdated.  we need a constitution that s better suited to the present era.  yoshihiro naito, 77, opposed the idea.  the commitment we ve made not to wage war has kept japan safe.  he plans to vote for an opposition party because he thinks abe and the ldp have become too powerful.  town officials said they have not taken any particular precautionary steps following the recent missile launches, nor do they plan any  duck and cover  drills that have been held elsewhere. the town has loud speakers on 50 tall poles to broadcast warnings for tsunamis, typhoons   and now missiles. in recent months, they have installed wireless units in 1,500 of the 2,200 homes so people can hear them when they are indoors.  erimo also has emergency stocks of food, water and other supplies, the mayor said. that s particularly important for erimo because it is linked to the rest of hokkaido by only one coast hugging road, which gets closed several times a year due to heavy rains or massive waves. local fishermen are nervous about north korea s warning that it might conduct a hydrogen bomb test over the pacific, which they worry would contaminate the water like the fukushima nuclear disaster did in 2011.  the radiation would make all the fish inedible,  said narita, the elderly fisherman.  like in fukushima, we couldn t do our jobs.  the town s dwindling fishing industry has already been hit hard by a plunge in the salmon catch as well as by a dearth of youngsters to take over the trade. when young people move away to cities such as sapporo, hokkaido s capital, sometimes their parents follow them, residents said. erimo s population, which peaked above 9,000 in the 1960s, has fallen to nearly half that level.  we re a fishing town,  said naito,  so if we can t catch fish any more, we re finished.

" a battle over who should run the u.s. consumer financial protection bureau (cfpb) in the coming months was set for court as obama era holdovers sought to maintain their control over a powerful watchdog which president donald trump is seeking to curb. cfpb staff returning to work on monday after the u.s. thanksgiving holiday break were left scratching their heads over who was in charge after outgoing director richard cordray formally resigned on friday and elevated his former chief of staff, leandra english, to replace him temporarily. hours later, president donald trump sought to over rule that move by naming his budget chief mick mulvaney — a harsh critic of the agency — as acting director. trump wants mulvaney to run the cfpb until he can get a permanent successor confirmed by the senate, a process which could take months. in yet another twist late on sunday, english sued the trump administration seeking to block mulvaney’s appointment. the move means a federal court will now decide which law applies when filling a temporary leadership vacancy at the relatively new agency. the unprecedented battle reflects competing visions of how to regulate the u.s. financial system. created in the wake of the financial crisis to protect consumers from predatory lending, the cfpb is hated by republicans who think it wields too much power and burdens banks and other lenders with unnecessary red tape. president barack obama appointed cordray, a democrat, as the cfpb’s first director and he developed a reputation for drafting aggressive rules curbing products such as payday loans while issuing multimillion dollar fines against large financial institutions like wells fargo (wfc.n).  in a tweet over the weekend, trump called the agency a “total disaster” that had “devastated” financial institutions. he has pledged to roll back many of the obama era financial regulations. liberal groups and consumer advocates planned a rally in front of the cfpb headquarters on monday morning to demonstrate support for the agency. as acting director, mulvaney would have the power to make far reaching decisions on enforcement and supervision of financial firms. trump administration officials say the president has the power to appoint an acting director under the 1998 federal vacancies reform act and, in an powerful boost for them, the cfpb’s own general counsel, mary mcleod, issued a three page memo agreeing.  “i advise all bureau personnel to act consistently with the understanding that director mulvaney is the acting director of the cfpb,” mcleod’s memo, dated november 25, stated. such advice will stick in the throats of many cfpb staffers. mulvaney once described the agency as a “sad, sick joke” and tried to get rid of it when he was a lawmaker in the house of representatives. english alluded to mulvaney’s views on the cfpb in her lawsuit. she has argued that the 2010 dodd frank wall street reform law that created the cfpb  stipulated that its deputy director would take over on an interim basis when a director departs. cordray named english as deputy director and said she would become the acting director. the cfpb was the brainchild of elizabeth warren, a democratic senator and liberal firebrand. over the weekend, lawmakers from both parties lined up to give opposing views of its role. dick durbin, the u.s. senate’s no. 2 democrat, told cnn on sunday that “wall street hates it like the devil hates holy water.” while the legal battle rages, the cfpb’s enforcement work will be put in limbo. “anything that the agency does or fails to do could be subject to challenge until this cloud is removed,” said harvard law school professor laurence tribe. the cfpb was preparing to sue santander (san.mc) as early as this week alleging that the spanish bank overcharged borrowers on auto loans, two sources familiar with the plans told reuters last week. it was not clear if that lawsuit will now go ahead. the agency’s rule making ability has already been halted by the republican controlled congress, which last month killed a cfpb rule that had allowed borrowers to join together to sue lenders. even if english prevails, trump’s permanent nominee is expected to neutralize much of the cfpb’s work. some of the names mentioned by lobbyists as potential permanent successors to cordray include republican representatives jeb hensarling and french hill, both cfpb critics.

" the growing feud between republican front runner donald trump and his central rival ted cruz intensified on saturday with tit for tat attacks that put to rest any notion that their debate night fight was a solitary engagement. the split between the two is evidence of the closeness of the race for the 2016 republican presidential nomination, particularly in iowa. polls there show a neck and neck battle with little more than two weeks to go until iowa on feb. 1 stages the first nominating contest on the road to the nov. 8 election. trump, who needs a victory in iowa to set a winning tone to his campaign, kept up his attempt to undermine cruz’s attempt to portray himself as an outsider to the political establishment. trump seized on a report in the new york times that said cruz had failed to disclose a second loan, from citibank, that helped bankroll his 2012 senate campaign. the times earlier had reported that cruz had not disclosed a loan from goldman sachs for the same campaign. cruz’s campaign has said the failure to report the loan was a paperwork error. “he didn’t report his bank loans,” trump told delegates to the south carolina tea party convention. some booed trump for criticizing cruz since they had cheered cruz when he spoke to the group earlier. “say whatever you want,” trump said in response to the boos. “he didn’t report his bank loans... and then he acts like robin hood. say whatever you want..” cruz did not mention trump to the tea party event but talking to reporters in fort mill, s.c., earlier in the day he was unsparing. he suggested the new york billionaire and former reality tv star lacks the temperament to be president, pointing to his frequent twitter assaults on his adversaries. he said trump had attacked him because cruz was a threat to him in iowa. “i think in terms of a commander in chief, we ought to have someone who isn’t springing out of bed to tweet in a frantic response to the latest polls,” cruz said. “i think the american people are looking for a commander in chief who is stable and steady and a calm hand to keep this country safe.” trying to prove trump is not the conservative he says he is,  cruz’s campaign released a video entitled “donald trump’s new york values” that linked to a 1999 interview trump did on nbc’s “meet the press” in which trump declared he favored a woman’s right to abortion and supported gay marriage. the two candidates had clashed at the last republican debate, on thursday in charleston, over the issue of “new york values” with trump saying cruz had insulted the city that absorbed the sept. 11, 2001, attacks and rebounded. trump brought up the issue again at a town hall meeting in portsmouth, n.h., hours before a scheduled address at the south carolina tea party convention in myrtle beach. cruz’s criticism of new york, he said, was a “total disgrace.”  (reporting by steve holland; editing by chizu nomiyama) sap is the sponsor of this coverage which is independently produced by the staff of reuters news agency.",0
" jerome powell was not on president donald trump’s early radar as a possible successor to federal reserve chair janet yellen, and was angling instead for a job as the u.s. central bank’s vice chair for supervision. but when he was passed over for that position last summer, it was one in a chain of events that set the stage for the 64 year old fed governor and former investment banker to take over as head of the world’s most powerful central bank. trump on thursday nominated powell to replace yellen when her term expires in early february, saying at the white house that the 64 year old lawyer and former investment banker has the necessary “wisdom and leadership.”[nl2n1n80d3]  other contenders for the job fell for different reasons, as trump soured on top white house economic adviser gary cohn, decided against renominating yellen despite largely approving of her policies and came to view two others as posing risks to the economy, according to current and former fed and government officials familiar with the decision.  in the end it was powell, a maryland native, avid cyclist, and guitar hobbyist, who checked all the boxes that mattered but carried none of the negatives.  if confirmed by the u.s. senate, powell would become the first person without an advanced economics degree to hold the job since william miller in the late 1970s. powell, who lists personal assets of between $20 million and $60 million on government disclosure forms, has served on corporate boards as a managing partner at the carlyle group, a private equity firm. but he has also burrowed deep over the last five years into the nuts and bolts of central banking, and schooled himself on broader monetary policy issues.    “jay does not come with baggage... he has never been at the extremes,” said steve bell, who worked with powell at the bipartisan policy center think tank and when powell was at the treasury department in former president george h.w. bush’s administration. when compared to other possible nominees, some of whom called for sweeping but ill defined changes at the fed, powell took “a straight tactical line” that offered a continuation of yellen’s policies, a moderate approach to bank regulation and, perhaps most importantly, the prospect of no surprises, bell said. powell’s private sector background appealed as well to trump’s preference for business figures over those with phds. a senior white house official on thursday called his experience “unique” and “refreshing” at a central bank increasingly dominated by economists.  stanford university economist john taylor, who developed the “taylor rule” for guiding monetary policy, and former fed governor kevin warsh, who resigned over the central bank’s massive bond buying stimulus program credited by many with spurring the u.s. economy after the 2007 2009 recession, were also interviewed for the fed job. they arguably had a head start, the backing of conservatives, and steady support from the wall street journal’s influential editorial board.  but they also carried the risk of financial market volatility, with investors regarding each as somebody who could tighten monetary policy at the central bank. that is something trump has indicated he wants to avoid. the first two names trump floated were yellen and cohn. but cohn fell out of favor after he criticized trump’s response to violence sparked by a white supremacist rally in virginia in august. a former fed official, contacted over the summer as part of the white house’s fed chief search, said it was clear the administration wasn’t interested, for example, in taylor and his reliance on “rules” that generally call for interest rates to be higher than they currently are. the administration officials vetting fed candidates were “very much opposed to taylor type rules and systematic policy,” said the former official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. warsh, meanwhile, became the target of an aggressive grassroots campaign that highlighted what some critics viewed as a history of bad calls on inflation during his tenure as a fed policymaker, portending a tough confirmation fight. powell also benefited from burgeoning relationships through his work on the technical aspects of markets, and his assumption of the role as the fed’s regulatory point person after the resignation of former fed governor daniel tarullo in april. that prompted powell to initially set his sights on the job of vice chair for supervision, though it soon became clear he would not get it, according to a person who had discussions with white house and fed officials involved in the process.  yet powell’s close work with the treasury resulted in secretary steven mnuchin becoming a strong advocate of his nomination to the top job, fed and government officials said on condition of anonymity. fed governor randal quarles, a friend and colleague who got the vice chair job that powell had wanted, was an additional ally in the mix. but it was powell’s support of the yellen fed’s policies, often credited with paving the way for a 4.2 percent unemployment rate, steady economic growth and calm markets, that may have been his strongest advantage in the race.  “trump is savvy enough to look at the numbers and who is in the chair,” said peter conti brown, an assistant professor at the wharton school of the university of pennsylvania. powell solves the problem of a republican administration that wants “the yellen fed without yellen,” conti brown said.

" the obama administration’s plan to prevent american companies from shifting their headquarters overseas to avoid u.s. taxes is coming under fire from companies and banks that say it would be costly and cumbersome. at issue are proposed treasury regulations to combat “earnings stripping,” a key goal for companies that carry out tax avoiding mergers known as “inversions” to reincorporate abroad, if only on paper, to cut their taxes. the practice effectively shifts taxable earnings from u.s. operations to the redomiciled former american parent as debt interest payments that are tax deductible in the united states and subject to a lower income tax rate overseas.  the treasury department is scheduled to hold a public hearing on the proposed changes on thursday. the administration’s proposals, which could be finalized within months, have already dampened interest in global mergers. the proposals are backed by democrats in congress and academics as a responsible step to prevent corporations from exiting the u.s. tax system. republicans say the measures overstep administration authority and could discourage foreign investment in the united states.  businesses and trade groups representing sectors ranging from bankers and retailers to manufacturers and oil producers said a treasury proposal to end the deductions by reclassifying the debt as equity would disrupt operations and saddle businesses with new red tape. u.s. multinational procter & gamble co warned treasury the proposed rules would require countless changes throughout its corporate structure if myriad daily loans between affiliates were recharacterized as equity investments. “it will be extremely difficult, if not impossible, to monitor and administer,” p&g’s chief financial officer jon moeller told the internal revenue service in a letter before the regulatory comment period ended last week.  he warned that the company would face pre tax costs of $220 million to $340 million a year as a result of adverse tax consequences and burdens. the regulations would also pose challenges for intercompany loans key to the financial services industry, according to citicorp, jpmorgan chase & co and bank of america corp, which filed a joint comment with the treasury.  “a financial services group would face the choice between, on the one hand, staggering administrative complexities and a tax burden disproportionate to its true economic profit, and on the other hand, the imposition of crippling constraints on its ordinary business activities,” said the banks, which seek an industry exemption. a treasury spokeswoman said officials could respond to the feedback but added the department was moving “swiftly” to finalize regulations.

" a senior u.s. consumer financial protection bureau official filed suit late on sunday trying to prevent president donald trump from naming an acting head of the watchdog agency, but its top lawyer concluded trump had the power to do so. the moves were the latest dramatic developments in the fight over leadership succession of an agency created in 2011 under democratic former president barack obama to protect consumers from predatory lending practices. republicans in the white house and congress have tried to weaken the agency. the leadership of the agency was plunged into confusion on friday after its outgoing obama era director richard cordray formally resigned and elevated his former chief of staff, leandra english, to replace him on an interim basis until the senate confirms a permanent successor named by trump. hours later, the republican president named mulvaney — his budget chief and a harsh critic of the agency — as its acting director. cfpb general counsel mary mcleod wrote a memo, first reported by reuters, concurring with the opinion of the u.s. justice department that trump had the power to appoint mulvaney to the post. “i advise all bureau personnel to act consistently with the understanding that director mulvaney is the acting director of the cfpb,” mcleod’s memo stated. late on sunday, english sued in u.s. district court in washington, seeking a temporary restraining order blocking trump from appointing mulvaney. in the filing, english said mulvaney had no experience in a consumer protection or financial regulatory role, had sought to get rid of the agency and once described it as a “sad, sick joke.” mcleod’s intervention bolstered trump’s position and isolated english, 34, who has held multiple jobs at the cfpb since its creation. white house spokeswoman sarah sanders said the trump administration is aware of english’s lawsuit, but said “the law is clear” and that mulvaney is the acting director. sanders pointed to mcleod’s conclusion, adding that “there should be no question” that mulvaney can take the job. “it is unfortunate that mr. cordray decided to put his political ambition above the interests of consumers with this stunt. director mulvaney will bring a more serious and professional approach to running the cfpb,” sanders said. both sides in the battle say they have the law on their side. democrats have said the 2010 dodd frank wall street reform law that created the agency stipulated that its deputy director would take over on an interim basis when a director departs until the senate confirms a permanent director. cordray named english as deputy director and said she would become the acting director. “it’s a very important fact ... their own general counsel came out with a different conclusion,” said alan kaplinsky, head of the consumer financial services group for law firm ballard spahr llp said. “now that the thing is in court, i think it is really going to be in the hands of the judge.” trump administration officials said the 1998 federal vacancies reform act gives a president the power to temporarily fill agency positions, except for those with multi member boards, an exemption they said did not apply to the cfpb. “the president’s attempt to install a white house official at the head of independent agency — while allowing that official to simultaneously serve in the white house — is unprecedented,” said english’s lawyer, deepak gupta of the law firm gupta wessler, adding that “the law is clear” and that english is the acting director. created after the 2008 financial crisis, the cfpb has issued rules and imposed steep penalties on banks, auto dealers, student lenders and credit card companies. [l8n1nw0mw]  future enforcement activities could be stymied while the question of who runs the cfpb is decided.  republican lawmakers argue that the agency wields too much unchecked power, adding that it burdens banks and credit card companies with unnecessary red tape.  writing on twitter, trump on saturday called the agency a “total disaster” that had “devastated” financial institutions.

" the top republican in the u.s. senate on tuesday rejected president donald trump’s suggestion that his party change the chamber’s rules to undercut the ability of democrats to block legislation with filibusters. “there is an overwhelming majority on a bipartisan basis that is not interested in changing the way the senate operates on the legislative calendar,” senate majority leader mitch mcconnell told reporters. mcconnell was responding to a question about a tweet in which trump suggested changing the rules so that legislation could pass on a simple majority vote. currently, the rules require a super majority of 60 votes to overcome a filibuster.

" china has told the united states that it warned pyongyang it would impose “sanctions actions on their own” against north korea should it carry out another nuclear test, u.s. secretary of state rex tillerson said on thursday. tillerson, speaking on fox news, also said u.s. intelligence reports suggest that north korean leader kim jong un was “not crazy,” indicating he might be a rational actor who could be negotiated with as the international community seeks to rein in pyongyang’s nuclear and missile programs. tillerson’s comments suggest that efforts by president donald trump, who held a summit with chinese president xi jinping earlier this month, may have yielded china’s toughest threat yet to take action against its defiant neighbor and ally, north korea.

" new york city mayor bill de blasio met with federal prosecutors on friday as part of their lengthy investigation into whether people involved in fundraising for his election campaign broke corruption laws, according to news reports. de blasio, a democrat who faces reelection in november, has repeatedly said he and his campaign staff have done nothing wrong and that he was cooperating with prosecutors from the u.s. attorney’s office in manhattan in their yearlong criminal investigation.  “we did everything right,” he said in a television interview last month. “my team did everything right.” prosecutors and agents from the federal bureau of investigation questioned him on multiple topics, according to the new york times.  the meeting took place at his lawyers’ office in manhattan, and his black sport utility vehicle was seen departing from the office garage about five hours after it arrived. news photographers briefly gave chase, but de blasio did not emerge from the vehicle to speak with waiting reporters. a spokesman for the mayor did not respond to questions on friday.  prosecutors from the manhattan u.s. attorney’s public corruption unit are looking at whether people who helped raise money for de blasio’s 2013 election campaign and a non profit organization that his advisers operated received favorable treatment from the mayor or his aides at city hall, according to news reports. a spokesman for the u.s. attorney’s office, which typically does not discuss ongoing investigations, declined to comment. after the meeting, the mayor, who had no public events planned for the day, headed to the airport to fly to atlanta for a meeting of the democratic national committee, according to his published schedule. last month, de blasio confirmed he was interviewed by state level prosecutors from the manhattan district attorney’s office in a separate investigation into his fundraising practices. he is no longer a target of that inquiry, although some of his aides may still be under scrutiny, according to the new york times. the private law firms defending the mayor and other officials are costing the city more than $11.6 million, the paper reported.

" when president donald trump takes the world stage at the united nations for the first time this week, he will share the spotlight with his envoy nikki haley, who has emerged as the surprising public face of u.s. foreign policy. haley, the 45 year old former south carolina governor, has proven to be a high profile member of trump’s administration, at times overshadowing secretary of state rex tillerson, the former chief executive of exxon mobil corp, despite her lack of previous foreign policy experience, diplomats say. “for the u.s., nikki haley is remarkable. it’s hard to find in the trump administration. it’s someone who is very approachable and politically very assertive,” said a senior european diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity.  “i see her potentially taking over from tillerson at some point. it’s clear her long term objective is the presidency,” the diplomat said.  haley dismisses speculation she could replace tillerson, the country’s top diplomat, who has at times publicly differed with trump during the president’s eight months in the white house. on sunday, she told cnn that tillerson is “not going anywhere and i continue to work well with him.” trump’s speech on tuesday at the u.n. general assembly will be his highest profile opportunity to explain his foreign policy vision couched in his america first agenda. haley arrived at the 193 member world body in january pledging to “take names” of allies who did not have washington’s back. trump administration officials say the president, happy with her performance, views her as both tough and smart. he speaks regularly with haley, his fellow republican, one u.s. administration official said.  twice in five weeks she persuaded the 15 member u.n. security council to unanimously boost sanctions on north korea. her blunt language has raised eyebrows among diplomats. at the same time she has been careful not to steal the limelight from trump, a wealthy businessman and former reality television star. “i personally think he slaps the right people, he hugs the right people, and he comes out with the u.s. being very strong in the end,” haley told white house reporters on friday. european council on foreign relations u.n. expert richard gowan said haley’s success could make trump nervous and that it would be a “bad deal for her” if she was asked to replace tillerson as secretary of state.   “she would lose the independence she enjoys in new york and (it would) tie her more closely to the president’s agenda. but it is an offer that she could not refuse. it’s an irony that the one way trump can hurt haley is to promote her,” he said.  haley credits trump with any u.s. achievements at the united nations. after the security council toughened sanctions on north korea this month, she praised his “strong relationship” with his chinese counterpart for the result. when he dismissed the sept. 11 u.n. resolution, which had been weakened by china and russia, as “just another very small step, not a big deal,” haley jumped to his defense and dismissed any suggestion they were not on the same page. “if we have to go further, this is going to look small compared to what we do,” she said at the time. haley has made her mark also by fighting what she describes as u.n. anti israel bias, pushing for u.n. reform amid trump’s call to slash u.s. funding, accusing iran of meddling in the middle east and challenging russia over ukraine and its support for syrian president bashar al assad. a senior administration official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that during a national security council meeting on iran this month, trump specifically asked haley’s opinion about what strategy to pursue. “she gave her opinion, and he liked her point of view,” the official said. “she wasn’t afraid to speak up.” a senior iranian official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said, “this lady for some reason is very angry with iran.” before her selection as ambassador, haley made national headlines when as governor she led a successful effort to remove the confederate battle flag, viewed by many as a racist emblem, from the grounds of the south carolina state capitol after the killing of nine black churchgoers in her state. during the 2016 presidential campaign haley sparred with trump, backing one of his rivals before he became the republican candidate. the daughter of immigrants from india, haley took trump to task over his harsh campaign rhetoric about illegal immigration and for not speaking forcefully enough against white supremacists. when last month trump inflamed tensions by saying that counter protesters were also to blame for a deadly rally by white nationalists in virginia, haley spoke up, telling u.s. media she had a “personal conversation” with him about it.  without naming trump she wrote to staff at the u.s. mission to the united nations to say that everyone must stand up and condemn hate.

" white house spokesman sean spicer triggered an uproar on tuesday by saying adolf hitler did not use chemical weapons. he apologized after his comments drew immediate criticism on social media and elsewhere for overlooking the fact that millions of jews were killed in nazi gas chambers. spicer made the assertion at a daily news briefing, during a discussion about the april 4 chemical weapons attack in syria that killed 87 people. washington has blamed the attack on the government of syrian president bashar al assad. “you had someone as despicable as hitler who didn’t even sink to using chemical weapons,” spicer said when asked about russia’s alliance with the syrian government. the nazis murdered six million jews during world war two. many jews as well as others were killed in gas chambers in european concentration camps. when a reporter asked spicer if he wanted to clarify his comments, he said: “i think when you come to sarin gas, there was no, he was not using the gas on his own people the same way that assad is doing.” later on tuesday, spicer apologized and said he should not have made that comparison. “it was a mistake. i shouldn’t have done it and i won’t do it again,” spicer told cnn in an interview. “it was inappropriate and insensitive.” spicer’s assertion, made during the jewish holiday of passover, sparked instant outrage on social media and from some holocaust memorial groups who accused him of minimizing hitler’s crimes.  “sean spicer now lacks the integrity to serve as white house press secretary, and president trump must fire him at once,” said steven goldstein, executive director of the anne frank center for mutual respect. shortly after the white house briefing, spicer emailed a statement to reporters in response to their queries, but had stopped short of offering an explicit apology.  “in no way was i trying to lessen the horrendous nature of the holocaust. i was trying to draw a distinction of the tactic of using airplanes to drop chemical weapons on population centers. any attack on innocent people is reprehensible and inexcusable,” spicer said in the statement. the u.s. holocaust museum did not mention spicer’s comments directly, but sent out a tweet shortly after the briefing that showed graphic footage of dead bodies u.s. forces found while liberating the buchenwald concentration camp. the video was retweeted more than a thousand times, with many twitter users referencing spicer’s comments. u.s. house democratic leader nancy pelosi called on republican president donald trump to reject spicer’s assertion. “sean spicer must be fired, and the president must immediately disavow his spokesman’s statements,” pelosi said in a statement. the white house did not immediately respond when asked to comment on pelosi’s statement. it was not the first time the white house has had to answer questions about the holocaust. critics in january noted the administration’s statement marking international holocaust remembrance day, which omitted any mention of jewish victims. at the time, spicer defended that statement by saying it had been written in part by a jewish staff member whose family members had survived the holocaust.

" u.s. president donald trump on sunday attempted to clear up confusion over whether he accepts russian president vladimir putin’s denials of meddling in the u.s. election last year. at a news conference in vietnam, trump distanced himself from remarks he made on saturday in which he suggested he believed putin when he said there had been no russian meddling in the election that took him to the white house. the comments had drawn criticism at home because u.s. intelligence agencies have long since concluded there was russian meddling. “as to whether i believe it or not, i’m with our agencies, especially as currently constituted,” trump said at a news conference with vietnamese president tran dai quang.  “as currently led, by fine people, i believe very much in our intelligence agencies.” he was careful to make clear he sided with the intelligence agencies under his own leadership. former u.s. intelligence director james clapper had told reuters: “the fact the president of the united states would take putin at his word over that of the intelligence community is quite simply unconscionable.”  the russian issue has clouded trump’s first year in office and his comments on saturday were a distraction from his    five nation asia tour. trump said he still believed putin did not think there had been russian meddling.     “i believe that president putin really feels, and feels strongly, that he did not meddle in our election,” trump said, while adding: “what he believes is what he believes.”  trump said he was not interested in arguing with putin over meddling and wanted to get on with russia to work on world problems including north korea, syria and ukraine. trump has called allegations of campaign collusion with moscow a hoax. a special counsel, robert mueller, is conducting an investigation that has led to charges against trump’s former campaign manager paul manafort and his associate rick gates. u.s. intelligence agencies have also concluded russians interfered to tip the election in trump’s favour through hacking and releasing emails to embarrass democratic candidate hillary clinton and spreading social media propaganda.

" u.s. senator rand paul of kentucky said he returned to work on monday, more than a week after he suffered six broken ribs when tackled by a neighbor while mowing his lawn. “while i’m still in a good deal of pain, i will be returning to work in the senate today, ready to fight for liberty and help move forward with tax cuts in the coming days and weeks,” the republican senator paul said on a twitter post. the man accused of tackling paul and breaking his ribs, rene boucher, 59, pleaded not guilty on thursday to a misdemeanor assault charge, a court official said. boucher is charged with fourth degree assault causing minor injury, for which he faces up to a year of imprisonment if convicted. a pretrial hearing was set for nov. 30.  boucher’s $7,500 bond requiring him to keep at least 1,000 feet (305 m) away from paul remained in effect. paul, 54, told police that boucher came on his property in a gated community near bowling green and tackled him from behind, the bowling green daily news reported, citing an arrest warrant. paul previously said on twitter he suffered the broken ribs from the nov. 3 incident and that x rays showed a pleural effusion, which is a buildup of fluid in the tissues that line the lungs and the chest. media reports have said boucher, also a physician like paul, had a long running dispute with the senator. but paul, in a washington examiner interview published monday, said he had no dispute with boucher and had not spoken to his neighbor in a decade. he said he knew of no motive for the incident. paul could not be reached by reuters monday. “my first encounter was basically being hit in the back,” he said. “we’ve never had words over anything, we’ve never had a dispute or discussion or words.” the kentucky state police and the federal bureau of investigation are investigating the incident, according to warren county attorney amy milliken. citing unnamed sources, fox news reported on thursday that paul had been told federal charges were expected in the case. “there is going to be a criminal prosecution,” paul told the examiner but did not elaborate on what he meant. there are no updates on the federal charges, david habich, an fbi spokesman in louisville, said in an email on monday. the senator’s office declined to comment on possible federal charges on monday.

" the u.s. consumer financial protection bureau, already in legal limbo after an october court decision, could find its powers scaled back by president elect donald trump and a republican led congress, according to members of both political parties, lobbyists and lawyers.  that may mean the end of many of the agency’s rule making actions that have enraged critics, including a proposal to stop companies from blocking customers from class action lawsuits and another one to limit payday lending. creation of the cfpb was authorized in the 2010 dodd frank wall street reform law enacted in the aftermath of the 2007 09 financial crisis. the agency began operations in 2011. an agency to protect consumers’ finances was the idea of liberal democratic senator elizabeth warren of massachusetts. its creation is considered one of democratic president barack obama’s top domestic policy achievements. a trump administration is expected to be hostile to the agency as it is currently formulated. “the election spells very bad news for the cfpb,” said alan kaplinsky, head of the consumer financial services group at law firm ballard spahr.  many republicans opposed the agency’s creation. they now say they dislike its structure and believe it oversteps its authority in enforcement. “it’s a very fragile thing. it was birthed in controversy and is under constant attack,” said consumer attorney deepak gupta, who worked at the cfpb in its early days. “it may not survive the way we know it through this administration.” a single director leads both rule making and enforcement, and can be dismissed only for cause. furthermore, the agency is funded by the u.s. federal reserve system, which means it is not dependent on the typical congressional appropriations process. the republican led house of representatives financial services committee in september passed legislation without any democratic votes that would change the name and structure of the agency and would create a five member commission to govern it. republicans also have pushed for the agency to receive funds from congress to make it accountable to elected leaders. both of those proposals would greatly weaken the power of richard cordray, the agency’s original and current director. obama has blocked these republican efforts with veto threats. trump, though he has not directly addressed the cfpb, has said he wants to roll back parts of dodd frank. trump could, if he wanted to, fire cordray on the first day of his presidency, especially following an october ruling by a three judge federal appeals court panel that found the agency’s structure unconstitutional and that the president should be able to dismiss the director at will. that ruling was put on hold while the cfpb decides whether to petition the entire u.s. court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit for a review or appeal the ruling to the u.s. supreme court. the agency has until nov. 25 to decide. trump’s administration could withdraw any appeal, letting the decision stand. cordray, appointed in 2013, is halfway through his five year term. few in the banking industry think the entire agency will be eliminated. democrats who support the agency will have a large presence in the senate. warren, who was obama’s first choice to head the agency, has promised that democrats will fight efforts to defang it. even some bankers want to see it stay. richard hunt, president of the consumer bankers association, said his group would fight to maintain the cfpb in some form because it consolidates consumer banking rules under one regulator.  trump takes office on jan. 20. cordray could be replaced early in 2017, said mark calabria, an economist at the libertarian cato institute think tank. trump’s transition team is already looking into cordray replacements, he said. the law allows for the president to terminate a director over inefficiency, malfeasance or neglect of duty, which leaves room for trump to find cause regardless of what the appeals court decides, calabria added. cordray has set precedent with enforcement cases that calabria and other critics have called backdoor rule making.  “cordray has left the cfpb vulnerable to what his successor may want done because he didn’t hardwire rule making,” calabria said. if cordray quits or is removed, statute calls for his deputy to step into the job temporarily. acting deputy director david silberman, also a strong consumer advocate, would likely continue to carry out the current agenda, said quyen truong, a partner at washington law firm stroock & stroock & lavan. truong was the assistant director and deputy general counsel for the cfpb until earlier this year. the cfpb did not respond to requests for comment on cordray’s possible departure or the fate of current rule making actions.

" australian prime minister malcolm turnbull said on sunday he was confident a refugee resettlement deal with the united states would go ahead, despite white house comments which seemed to cast doubt about its future under a trump administration.  white house deputy spokesman eric schultz told reporters the deal to resettle in the u.s refugees currently held at australian funded offshore processing centers was reached with president barack obama, and it was the prerogative of each president to set policies. “we have one president at a time, schultz said on friday. “the president elect, donald trump, will set the policies once he takes the oath of office.” turnbull downplayed the comments when questioned by reporters in sydney on sunday. “it’s a very good arrangement and we are confident that we’ll continue through the change of administration,” the australian associated press quoted him saying. australia announced last month the obama administration had agreed to take a substantial number of the 1,200 refugees held on nauru and manus island in papua new guinea. the resettlement deal with united states came after turnbull agreed in september to take part in a u.s. led program to resettle refugees from guatemala, honduras and el salvador as part of australia’s annual intake of 18,750 asylum seekers. whether donald trump, who has advocated a ban on people from nations that had been “compromised by terrorism”, honors the agreement is uncertain.  u.s. homeland security officials were scheduled to begin assessing asylum seekers on nauru this week. many of asylum seekers at the camps are muslims who have fled conflicts in iraq, syria, afghanistan and pakistan. ian rintoul, from the refugee action coalition, said it was very clear the deal australia struck with the u.s. was not airtight. “the announcement was very hastily put together because they weren’t expecting trump to win and then it came very clear the whole deal could roll over,” he said.

" the u.s. justice department has given immunity from prosecution to a state department employee who helped set up and manage the private email server hillary clinton used for her work as secretary of state, the washington post reported on wednesday. a senior u.s. law enforcement official said the federal bureau of investigation (fbi) had secured the cooperation of bryan pagliano, who worked on clinton's 2008 presidential campaign before joining the state department with her and setting up the server in her new york home in 2009, the newspaper reported. (wapo.st/1rqkik2) the post described the investigation as a criminal inquiry, a label clinton and her staff have resisted as they seek to reassure voters that the frontrunner to become the democratic party’s nominee in november’s presidential election is not in legal jeopardy. clinton has said she did nothing wrong and that she believes the u.s. government will vindicate her. she has also apologized for what she said was poor judgment. in 2014, clinton returned about 30,000 emails to the state department, but said she “chose not to keep” thousands of others her staff deemed not to be work related. her staff have acknowledged that other work emails were not handed over, without explaining why. more than 2,000 of clinton’s work emails contain classified information that could harm national security if exposed, according the state department, including 22 classified as ‘top secret’, the highest level. the government forbids sending or storing classified emails through unsecured, non government channels, and has prosecuted people for breaches. brian fallon, a clinton spokesman, said in a statement that clinton’s campaign was “pleased” that pagliano was cooperating. the justice department and fbi declined to comment on whether pagliano had been granted immunity, and his lawyer did not respond to questions. last month, a federal judge overseeing a civil lawsuit against the state department ruled that department officials and aides to clinton could be questioned under oath about whether her use of a private email system was an effort to skirt open records laws. the fbi is likely to ask clinton and her aides in coming months how the server was set up and whether they knew they were sending classified information in emails, the post reported. pagliano has declined to testify to lawmakers, citing a constitutional right against self incrimination. republicans have called for clinton’s prosecution. “this terrible error in judgment coupled with clinton’s arrogant and dishonest claims shows she can’t be trusted with the presidency,” reince priebus, the republican national committee’s chairman, said in a statement.

" sixty people including a former military chief faced demands for life jail terms over a 1997 campaign of army pressure, known in turkey as the  post modern  coup, that toppled the country s first islamist led government, state media said on thursday. coups in 1960 and 1980 and a failed 2016 putsch involved overt army use of force, but the resignation of prime minister necmettin erbakan followed warnings and only a brief appearance of tanks in a provincial town. it is an action that has long rankled with current islamist rooted president tayyip erdogan.  in his final opinion on the case, the prosecutor said the army action, which did not result in any direct military rule, constituted a real coup attempt and could not be defined as  post modern , broadcaster ntv reported. among those facing life sentences are general ismail hakki karadayi, 85, who was chief of general staff between 1994 and 1998, and his deputy at the time general cevik bir, state run anadolu news agency said. the investigation into the unseating of erbakan, who led a coalition government, is one of a series of court cases that have targeted the formerly all powerful secularist military in recent years. the army s influence has been curbed drastically under  erdogan, who first came to power in 2003 and who was a member of erbakan s welfare party at the time of the government s ouster. a total of 103 people, mostly retired generals, had been named in the trial s 1,300 page indictment, accused of  overthrowing by force, and participating in the overthrow  of a government. while aggravated life sentences were sought for 60 defendants, the prosecutor asked for the acquittal of 39 other defendants, ntv reported. the four other defendants have died since the court case began in 2013. last year, rogue soldiers commandeered warplanes, tanks and helicopters in a failed coup which killed 250 people and which ankara has blamed on u.s. based islamic preacher fethullah gulen. he has denied involvement. erbakan, who died in 2011, pioneered islamist politics in turkey, a muslim country with a secular state system, paving the way for the later success of erdogan s ak party.

" shortly after donald trump won the u.s. presidential election in november, vice president elect mike pence visited the country’s largest manufacturing lobby group, six blocks from the white house, to brainstorm about trump’s legislative agenda. the conversation at the national association of manufacturers was friendly, with a lot of “give and take,” said aric newhouse, nam’s senior vice president of government relations. the business group felt pence spoke their language and that it would be full steam ahead on long sought goals such as simplifying the tax code and repealing obamacare, president barack obama’s signature legislation that aimed to extend health insurance to cover more americans. but over the past week, trump has sown confusion about some of his legislative aims. he criticized a key element of his republican party’s tax plan, known as the border adjustment tax. he also seemed to muddy the waters on his promise of repealing obamacare by calling for healthcare insurance for all. while nam was not unduly alarmed, the episode highlights the challenge facing pence, 57, who will serve as chief emissary to capitol hill for trump after the new york businessman is sworn in as the 45th u.s. president on friday. pence spent a dozen years as a congressman beginning in 2001, forging a number of personal relationships, especially with conservatives. while he does not have a reputation on the hill as a deal maker, lawmakers, hill aides and lobbyists describe him as affable and a good communicator who is respectful in his dealings with both friend and foe.  but the nam experience shows that pence’s biggest obstacle in striking deals in congress may be trump himself. that’s because people negotiating with pence may not always know if he speaks for his boss. pence and trump are a study in contrasts. where trump is combative and chases the limelight, pence, most recently governor of indiana, is even keeled and calm, a man described by republicans and democrats as articulate and upbeat. few vice presidents in modern u.s. history have occupied the central role in legislative affairs that pence will have. former vice president dick cheney cut deals and cajoled lawmakers for president george w. bush, but pence’s assignment may be broader. in trump’s first 100 days in office, pence will be “leading the charge” on a number of initiatives in congress, such as rewriting obamacare and overhauling the tax code, senior trump  adviser kellyanne conway told reuters. “he has the assurance and the green light to do so from president trump,” conway said. “he is a major part of every serious conversation and important decision that is made, especially when it comes to the legislative agenda,” she said. while pence certainly appears to be part of trump’s inner circle, it’s far from clear who is closest to the new president, or whether they will tend to agree with pence. even though republicans control both chambers of congress, pence will need plenty of political finesse to rally the party’s sometimes unruly rank and file lawmakers behind trump’s agenda, once it is more fully fleshed out. from the conservative tea party faction to the moderate republicans, the party remains divided. many republicans differ with trump on issues such as free trade and worry he might be too willing to spend money that could increase budget deficits. in his home state of indiana during the 1990s, pence honed his communication skills as a talk radio host. but his low key style stood in stark contrast to many conservative radio hosts. he has called himself “rush limbaugh on decaf,” referring to the influential right wing talk show host famous for his flame throwing statements.  pence, who was raised catholic and later became an evangelical christian, would sometimes host bible studies in his office in the house of representatives. texas representative john carter attended those meetings and recalled that pence “had a little setup of a radio station” there in a reminder of his former career. during republican president george w. bush’s administration, pence firmly established himself as a fiscal hawk. he resisted initiatives that he viewed as government overreach, including the 2002 “no child left behind” education reform that emphasized standardized testing as a way of gauging how well schools were doing in raising student performance. pence’s staunch opposition to big government made him one of the “forerunners” to what later became the tea party, said michael steel, a former spokesman for house speaker paul ryan’s predecessor, john boehner. republican senator jeff flake, who served in the house with pence during the 2000s, said the two of them fashioned themselves as self appointed fiscal watchdogs. they kept a close eye on late night sessions where other lawmakers would seek to get more government spending approved without anyone noticing. “mike and i would have to wait up all night and rush to the (house) floor and burst through the doors” to object to those measures, flake recounted in an interview. “somebody said at one point when we burst through it looked like the saloon doors in ‘butch cassidy and the sundance kid,’” flake said, referring to the 1969 film about the two wild west outlaws. representative jim jordan of ohio, a leading conservative voice, said pence has been a role model for other republicans on how to advance conservative principles without being hard edged.     “i always remember the line pence had: ‘i’m a conservative and i’m not mad about it’ ... it’s a line i’ve used many times, saying that mike pence always used to say that,” jordan said. pence calls speaker ryan, who has struggled with staunch conservatives in his caucus, a close friend. their ties may help to smooth over some of the tensions that arose between ryan and trump during the 2016 campaign.  cultivating republicans won’t be pence’s only job. if republicans in the house of representatives can rally around trump’s agenda, democrats will have few tools to block them. but in the senate, democrats can use procedural moves to stop legislation that does not otherwise have support from 60 senators. republicans control 52 votes in the 100 member chamber. pence’s smooth demeanor will go only so far given his ideological gulf with congressional democrats. he has raised the ire of democrats with his outspoken stance against abortion, his work against gay rights, his opposition to measures aimed at women’s pay equity in the workplace and his determination to repeal obamacare.  republican senator roy blunt of missouri, who was part of the house republican leadership during the mid 2000s, said he expected pence would stick to his conservative principles, even if they clashed with trump’s. “i don’t think he’d be very effective arguing against his own feelings,” blunt said. “but i think he’d be smart enough to go to the president and say, ‘i can be supportive of this because you are the president and i am the vice president, but i am not going to be a good salesman’” on that particular issue.

" u.s. president elect donald trump pumped a total of $66 million of his own money into his campaign   far from the $100 million he frequently boasted he was going to spend, according to campaign finance disclosures filed on thursday night. trump related business industries   those bearing his own name, including his private jet and the manhattan building that served as his campaign headquarters   received $11 million in payments from his campaign.  trump shocked the political world when he defeated democratic rival hillary clinton in the nov. 8 election for the white house, overcoming a spending deficit and outperforming polls in several swing states to propel him to victory.  earlier this week, trump’s campaign revealed that he sold his entire stock portfolio in june, a holding that was estimated at about $40 million. opting to liquidate his assets could have been a move to pump cash into his campaign, which at the time was struggling to raise funds from private donors. the move to sell his stocks came weeks after he forgave about $47 million in loans he had already given his campaign.  in total, trump raised $339 million and spent $322 million   a far cry from the $565 million spent by clinton, according to the latest federal election commission disclosure reports. trump spent $94 million in the final days of the campaign, compared with the $132 million spent by clinton. trump frequently promised to run a shoe string campaign and argued his self funding model meant he wasn’t obligated to any special interests. he blasted polling as a useless art and pollsters as a waste of money as he overcame 16 republican foes during the primary election season in early 2016. trump rode to victory on more than $5 billion in “free” television on news programs that provided wall to wall coverage of his every word, according to data analytics firm mediaquant. but when the realities of the general election began to sink in   and trump’s poll numbers sank   he shifted and began spending money on polling and television ads.  in total, trump spent $107 million on advertising, including television ads, and another $85 million in digital and online advertising. his second largest expense was air travel, totaling $26 million and accounting for more campaign spending than his payroll.

" a leading senate democrat on tuesday accused u.s. attorney general jeff sessions of concealing policy recommendations that could change how the justice department enforces laws on illegal immigration, drug trafficking and violent crime. in a letter to sessions, oregon democrat ron wyden said the justice department should release recommendations made by the task force on crime reduction and public safety, noting that the policy changes could end up hurting americans. “these [justice department] decisions could have dramatic and wide ranging consequences for americans’ daily lives,” wyden wrote, noting that the task force’s work could impact everything from marijuana and asset forfeiture policies to hate crimes, immigration and human trafficking. “yet americans remain in the dark about the content of the task force’s recommendations.” the task force on crime reduction and public safety was established through an executive order by president donald trump in february. names of those serving on the task force have not been published, and the group was supposed to deliver its recommendations by july 27. in a public statement last week, sessions said he had received recommendations “on a rolling basis” and he had already “been acting on the task force’s recommendations to set the policy of the department.” a justice department spokesman referred to sessions’ prior statement when asked for comment, saying the department will “make announcements on policy changes as appropriate.” the department has already announced a few policy changes that stem from the task force’s work. earlier this month, for instance, the department said it plans to reinstate a controversial civil asset forfeiture program that lets local police departments seize cash from people without first charging them with a crime, even if their states do not condone such a policy.  the policy had been rolled back during the obama administration amid concerns it was allowing the government to take away peoples’ property without due process. in may, the department also undid another obama era policy to allow for tougher charges and longer prison sentences.  wyden, whose state voted to legalize the use of recreational marijuana, said he was particularly concerned about the “secrecy shrouding” recommendations related to the drug. sessions has previously made critical comments about marijuana use. “it is not the role of the attorney general to unilaterally undermine the will of oregon voters,” he wrote.

"in a new poll that asked americans to comment on their anger issues, republicans and white people reported being angry nearly all the time.perhaps stoked by hate-mongering organizations like fox news and right-wing radio, a large portion of conservative white people said they got enraged over current events at least once a day, and many felt that they were angrier now than they were just one year ago.overall, 49 percent of americans said they find themselves feeling angrier now about current events than they were one year ago. whites are the angriest, with 54 percent saying they have grown more outraged over the past year. that s more than latinos (43 percent) and african-americans (33 percent).seventy-three percent of whites said they get angry at least once per day, compared with 66 percent of hispanics and 56 percent of blacks.the poll also found republicans are angrier than democrats. sixty-one percent of republicans say current events irk them more today than a year ago, compared to 42 percent of democrats.the poll, while not exactly scientific, does reinforce earlier research that found white, conservative americans feel they are more oppressed than any other group. oftentimes, this anxiety is  explicitly about not coming to grips with a black president.peter brimelow, author of  alien nation: common sense about america s immigration disaster,  asserts that much of white america s anxiety derives from living under a black president and changing demographics.diversity, he says,  is not strength. the tea party is a response to this emerging white fear. conservative politicians, sensing an opportunity, seized hold of those anxieties and exploited them for votes. it was also impossible to contain. the hatred and fear-mongering on the right has turned into an uncontrollable inferno. the results are toxic new realities like donald trump s popularity and   more recently   the armed takeover of a federally owned wildlife reserve by right-wing extremists who think paying grazing fees for their cattle is tyranny.on the face of things, americans should have less to be angry about. conservatives may not like it, but the economy has roared back to life under obama. more americans have health insurance than at any time in history. social injustices that have long plagued the country are finally being reckoned with. crime, in large part, is down.what s left is the shrieking, hollow screams from pundits and politicians who desperately need you to stay mad. the tea party was an utter disaster, and many of its beneficiaries have been booted out of office by voters with a tea party hangover, but its initial surge of racist, xenophobic rage proved to many that  voting angry  is a legitimate   if pathetic   electoral strategy. and as america approaches its next election, it s clear that they are madder than ever.feature image via flickr",1

" republican presidential candidate donald trump said on friday he favored the united states reaching trade agreements with individual countries as opposed to multilateral accords like the trans pacific partnership. trump, who is leading in the race for the republican nomination for president, has made his opposition to trade deals like the 12 nation tpp and the north american free trade agreement a centerpiece of his campaign toward the nov. 8 vote. “to do these deals where they wrap them up and they put 12 countries in one. tpp is an example. i want individual trade deals with individual countries,” trump told a palm beach, florida, news conference ahead of the state’s nominating contest on tuesday. “some countries treat us better than others. some are worse,” he said. “china will take advantage of tpp. it’s not in it now but believe me they come through the back door. they are watching it so closely,” said trump, a real estate developer. the deal was reached in october. trump said he favored free trade but it must be “fair.” he said nafta had cost many americans their jobs and tpp, which must be ratified by congress, would do the same.  the united states already has bilateral trade deals with 20 countries, including canada, israel, mexico, peru, singapore and south korea.

" democrat hillary clinton has a 5 percentage point lead over republican donald trump in the u.s. presidential race, according to the latest reuters/ipsos opinion poll released on friday, roughly the same advantage she has held all month. the survey result showed little movement following monday night’s presidential debate, the first of three debates before the nov. 8 election. the sept. 23 29 national tracking poll showed that likely voters support clinton over trump by 43 percent to 38 percent, while another 19 percent said they would not pick either candidate. clinton has mostly led trump in the poll this year, and her level of support has been 4 5 percentage points higher than trump’s in each of the last four weeks. in a separate poll that included alternative party candidates, clinton led the field by 4 percentage points. among likely voters, 42 percent supported clinton, 38 percent supported trump, 7 percent supported libertarian candidate gary johnson and 3 percent supported jill stein of the green party. monday’s debate was the most watched presidential debate in u.s. history, with an estimated 84 million people tuning in for the 90 minute exchange. some 56 percent of americans adults who watched the debate said clinton won, according to a reuters/ipsos poll released on wednesday. voters appeared to be warming up to both candidates in friday’s poll. some 48 percent of likely voters said they had an overall favorable view of clinton, compared with 45 percent in the previous week, while 46 percent said they had a favorable view of trump, up from 44 percent the week before. the reuters/ipsos poll is conducted online in english in all 50 states. the poll included 2,501 people who were considered likely voters due to their registration status, voting history and stated intention to vote in the election. it has a credibility interval, a measure of accuracy, of 2 percentage points. national opinion polls have differed this year in how they measure support for clinton and trump. some polls, like reuters/ipsos, try to include only likely voters, while others include all registered voters. the reuters/ipsos tracking poll also gathers responses every day and reports results twice a week, so it often detects trends in sentiment before most other polls. an average of major opinion polls aggregated by realclearpolitics showed clinton ahead of trump by 2.9 percentage points on friday, or 47.3 points to 44.4, slightly lower than the previous margin of 3 points on wednesday, but well up from 0.9 point on sept. 19.

" u.s. secretary of agriculture tom vilsack said tuesday that farm officials want to lay the groundwork so american agricultural exporters can seize new opportunities in cuba if the trade embargo on the country is lifted. the normalization of trade relations would allow u.s. farmers to use lower transportation costs to edge in on the european union’s food exports to cuba, vilsack said. president barack obama has been using his executive powers to chip away at the half century old trade embargo, imposed on the communist ruled nation in 1960, but cannot lift it without approval from congress that is unlikely under current republican leadership. “there are still preliminary steps that can be taken to prepare for that day,” vilsack said in an interview in peru. “when it happens, the united states will be in a very good position to reclaim a portion of the market we’ve lost.” vilsack cited soybeans, rice, poultry and biofuels as new markets u.s. farmers could tap in cuba, which in turn could sell organic products to its former cold war foe. the obama administration is asking congress for $1.5 million for on the ground studies into challenges to agricultural trade in cuba, from pests to a diplomatic void left by decades of hostile relations. “we have not had people on the ground,” vilsack said. “we need to develop relationships with the people in cuba so we know who to do business with and who actually makes the deals.” vilsack, who visited cuba last month, said state agricultural commissioners and secretaries have also been traveling to the island on trade missions. “they have been down to cuba and they have come back with small contracts for commodities,” vilsack said. vilsack said farmers were the most excited about the reopening of relations with cuba, once a global sugarcane powerhouse. the u.s. would aim to meet 50 percent of cuba’s food and agricultural needs if trade resumes fully, up from less than 15 percent now, the u.s. department of agriculture said in a statement to reuters after the interview. vilsack also said he was optimistic obama would persuade congress to pass the trans pacific partnership trade deal before the end of his term, despite the recent surge in anti trade rhetoric in presidential campaigns. “the president is very committed to getting it done and he intends to work as long and hard as he needs to ultimately get it passed,” vilsack said.

" indiana governor mike pence, the republican nominee for u.s. vice president, lost another round in federal court on monday in his bid to keep refugees fleeing syria’s civil war from resettling in his state. the 7th u.s. circuit court of appeals in chicago affirmed a lower court ruling that pence’s order seeking to bar state agencies from helping the resettlement of syrian immigrants discriminates against the refugees based on their national origin. the setback for pence comes a day before he is scheduled to debate the democratic vice presidential nominee, virginia governor tim kaine, on national television. pence was among more than 25 u.s. governors, mostly republicans, who urged president barack obama to stop resettling refugees fleeing syria’s civil war after november attacks by extremists in paris that killed 130. critics of the resettlement program have argued that it leaves the united states vulnerable to infiltration by militants from islamic state, also known as isis, which has seized vast swaths of territory in syria and iraq and claimed responsibility for attacks on civilians in paris and elsewhere. but appeals court judge richard posner, writing for the three judge panel that sided unanimously against pence, said the governor’s assertions of a national security threat were presented “without evidence” and amounted to “nightmare speculation.” all three appellate panel members are republican appointees, including judge diane sykes, who pence’s running mate, donald trump, has said he would nominate to the u.s. supreme court if he wins the nov. 8 presidential election. a pence spokeswoman, kara brooks, said the fbi and u.s. homeland security department have acknowledged “security gaps” in screening of syrian refugees. she also quoted a state department spokesman who said last month that he “‘wouldn’t debate the fact that there’s the potential for isis terrorists to try to insert themselves’ into the refugee program.”  pence’s order was blocked by a u.s. district judge in february after a court challenge brought by the american civil liberties union (aclu), and he appealed.  the aclu welcomed the court’s ruling on monday as upholding the group’s position that the governor “may not constitutionally or legally discriminate against a particular nationality of refugees that are extensively vetted by the federal government.” indiana has accepted 150 syrian immigrants between oct. 1, 2015, and aug. 31, 2016, accounting for about 9 percent of all refugee arrivals in the state during that period, according to the state department.

" shares worth over $500 million in thailand s siam commercial bank have been transferred on behalf of king maha vajiralongkorn from the crown property bureau, which manages palace assets, a filing with thailand s securities and exchange commission (sec) said on friday. the filing by the crown property bureau did not identify the ultimate beneficiary of the shares, nor did it indicate if any money had been paid for the shares. the transfer took place on oct 2, the filing said. the law was changed in july to formally give the king control of the crown property bureau. details of its assets are not made public, but they are estimated to be worth more than $30 billion. the crown property bureau confirmed the transaction but declined comment on how the transfer fitted with changes to the way palace finances are run since the king took the throne late last year after the death of his revered father.  it is his majesty s private affair so i cannot comment further,  said an official of the crown property bureau who declined to be named because of the sensitivity of anything to do with thailand s palace. the king has put an increasingly assertive stamp on the monarchy since succeeding his father king bhumibol adulyadej, who will be cremated on oct. 26 in a ceremony that marks an end to more than a year of mourning in thailand. siam commercial bank, thailand s third largest bank by assets, declined to comment on the transaction in its shares. the filing said that the shares transferred amounted to 3.33 percent of the total value of the bank. after the transfer, the crown property bureau still had a holding of 18.14 percent, it said. based on the latest share price, the shares had a value of 16.9 billion baht ($505 million). at the latest dividend yield of 3.62 percent, the shares would give a payout of around $18 million a year. shares in scb closed 0.66 percent down on friday compared to a 0.22 percent fall in the banking index. the crown property bureau s stakes in scb and siam cement pcl are together worth around $8.3 billion.  according to a former official within the crown property bureau, they have accounted for up to 80 percent of the agency s income in recent years. although its real estate holdings are bigger, the returns from those are much lower.

" the chairman of the u.s. senate foreign relations committee, which oversees the confirmation of foreign service nominees, said on wednesday it was “highly unlikely” that an ambassador to cuba would be approved this year. president barack obama on tuesday nominated career diplomat jeffrey delaurentis to be the first u.s. ambassador to cuba in more than five decades. “the committee was notified of the nomination yesterday but has not yet received the appropriate paperwork to begin its work,” republican senator bob corker said in a statement emailed to reuters. “however, it is highly unlikely that an ambassador to cuba would be approved in the lame duck.” the appointment of delaurentis, the top american official at the u.s. embassy in havana, marked obama’s latest move to go as far as he can in normalizing ties between the former cold war foes before he leaves office in january. but the nomination must be approved by the republican controlled senate, which is seen as a long shot. corker’s committee would have to hold a confirmation hearing for delaurentis and vote to approve his nomination before it would go to the full senate, where it could be blocked by any senator. many lawmakers have warmly embraced obama’s moves toward more normal relations with cuba, which became public in a shock announcement in december 2014. but several strongly oppose his efforts, arguing that cuba must do far more to improve human rights before it can deal normally with the united states. cuban american senators such as republicans marco rubio and ted cruz and democrat robert menendez are particularly opposed to obama’s policy. rubio and menendez are both members of the foreign relations panel. congress’ “lame duck” session takes place in november and december, after the elections on nov. 8 and before the new congress comes to washington in january.

" italy s ruling democratic party (pd) has lost further ground over its rivals after political infighting and fallout from a banking scandal, an opinion poll showed on sunday. the poll comes just weeks before parliament is expected to be dissolved before elections early next year. the pd share of the vote fell 1 percent, from eight days ago, to 23.4 percent, its lowest level in five years, according to the ipsos poll in the newspaper corriere della sera. support for the pd, headed by former prime minister matteo renzi, has fallen steadily in recent months, with the group damaged by deep schisms and personality clashes. the party has also come under fire over allegations cabinet undersecretary maria elena boschi took steps to try to save banca etruria, a local bank based in her home town of arezzo. boschi has repeatedly denied exerting any political pressure in deciding the future of banca etruria. the ipsos poll said growing support from smaller allies had raised the center left bloc s share of the vote to 26.2 percent, as of dec. 14, from 24.8 percent. that was well short of the 36 percent polled by the center right bloc led by former prime minister silvio berlusconi. it was also behind the 28.2 percent share of the 5 star anti establishment party. the 5 star movement is predicted to emerge as the largest single party in the next parliament, but it has repeatedly ruled out joining any coalition. italy has just introduced a new electoral system that is expected to handicap 5 star, favoring instead mainstream political blocs. italy s parliament is likely to be dissolved between christmas and the new year, opening the way for national elections in early march that look unlikely to produce a clear winner.

" pennsylvania governor tom wolf raised the minimum wage for state workers and employees of some contractors by 40 percent to $10.15 an hour on monday, a gesture aimed in part at putting pressure on republican lawmakers. wolf, a democrat, who signed an executive order to make the change, acknowledged that only 450 of the state’s 79,000 employees, mainly temporary workers hired during tax season, are currently paid less than $10.15 an hour. he said he hoped to send a message to the republican dominated legislature to enact a similar increase for all pennsylvania residents. “an increase in the minimum wage will lead to increases in employee morale, productivity, and quality of work and decreases in turnover and the cost of training and supervision,” said wolf, who lacks the power to order the statewide increase.  at a press conference, wolf said a statewide increase would benefit business in the long run. fourteen states have a minimum wage of at least $10. the governor said inflation had pushed the value of the state’s current $7.25 minimum wage below the poverty line. going forward, the state would adjust the minimum wage for government workers to keep up with inflation, he said. wolf did not specify where the money would come from when questioned during the news conference.  pennsylvania has been without a state budget since july 1 because of republican resistance to raising taxes and wolf’s refusal to sign a budget that he said would lead to a gaping structural deficit. the wage increase announced for state employees would cost the state $1.5 million and will take effect immediately. it would apply to many but not all contractors doing business with the state, costing the state an extra $2.6 million.  about 60 percent of that will go to contract employees at the state’s photo license bureaus, but only when those contracts are renewed.  the minimum wage increase will not apply for now to human service agencies funded by the state, wolf said, because they are already “stressed” by delayed funding caused by the budget stand off. senate majority leader jake corman accused wolf of acting like president barack obama by seeking to implement policy changes through executive orders. “choosing to take symbolic executive action on this issue instead of working with the legislature underscores his failures to collaborate,” corman said in a statement.

" the campaign of roy moore, the republican candidate for u.s. senator in alabama who has been accused of sexual misconduct, appealed on sunday to president donald trump’s supporters, saying a vote for moore would be a vote for trump’s agenda. in the final days before tuesday’s special election, opinion polls show a tight race between moore, a 70 year old conservative christian and former state judge, and democrat doug jones, a 63 year old former u.s. attorney. dean young, chief political strategist for moore, cast jones as a liberal who would vote against trump’s priorities such as building a wall on the u.s. mexico border and cutting taxes. “if the people of alabama vote for this liberal democrat doug jones, they’re voting against the president who they put in office at the highest level,” young told abc’s “this week.” “so it’s very important for donald trump. ... if they can beat him, they can beat his agenda, because judge moore stands with donald trump and his agenda.” moore has been accused of sexual misconduct toward women when they were teenagers and he was in his 30s, including one woman who said he tried to initiate sexual contact with her when she was 14.  moore has denied the misconduct allegations and said they were a result of “dirty politics.” he has said that he never met any of the women involved. reuters has not independently verified any of the accusations. as the race tightens, jones has cranked up his attacks on moore over the allegations and made those charges central to his argument that moore is an unsuitable choice. the effort by the moore campaign to align itself as closely as possible with trump raises the stakes for the president in the alabama race. trump has endorsed moore and praised him on friday at a rally in pensacola, florida, near the alabama state line. the president’s support of moore came despite efforts by other senior republicans, including senate majority leader mitch mcconnell, to distance themselves from moore. alabama voters went strongly for trump in last year’s presidential election, favoring him by 62 percent to 34 percent over democrat hillary clinton. washington has been roiled by sexual misconduct scandals, with accusations leading to the resignations last week of three members of congress. the growing wave of women reporting abuse or misconduct has brought down powerful men, from movie producer harvey weinstein to popular television personality matt lauer. republican leaders have said that if moore wins, he could face an immediate investigation by the senate ethics committee. republican richard shelby, the senior u.s. senator from alabama, said on cnn’s “state of the union” that he did not vote for moore and instead backed a write in candidate. the editorial board of the al.com website, which covers alabama news, has endorsed jones. in an editorial on sunday, the website urged conservative voters in alabama to follow shelby’s lead and consider a write in candidate if they did not want to vote for jones.

" the trump organization pulled out of a $250 million real estate project in ex soviet georgia to avoid a potential conflict with donald trump’s role as president, trump’s former business partner in the project told reuters. the trump organization declined to comment on the assertion that it quit the project due to conflict of interest concerns, and the trump transition team did not respond to a request for comment. since winning election as u.s. president, donald trump has said he would take steps to ensure he had no conflict of interests with his business. however, he has given few details on how he will do that. trump planned to give his brand name to georgian developer silk road group, to build a 47 storey residential tower in the georgian black sea resort of batumi, a plan he had announced during his visit to the south caucasus country in april 2012. srg and the trump organization announced their joint decision to terminate the project last week, but did not elaborate on the reasons.  “the only reason (for project termination) was that mr. trump was elected as the u.s. president and could not continue business abroad as it would pose a conflict of interest,” giorgi ramishvili, srg head, told reuters in an interview. “i appreciate that the trump organization said in the statement that it had continued to hold our company and georgia in the highest regard.” federal law does not prohibit the president’s involvement in private business while in office, even though lawmakers and executive branch officials are subject to conflict of interest rules. nevertheless, trump has come under pressure from democrats, and some of his republican allies, to avoid any conflict of interests. trump has said he plans to transfer control of his businesses to his oldest three children. georgia will present the white house with a thorny foreign policy problem. a close u.s. ally seeking membership of nato, it accuses russia of propping up separatists in two breakaway regions on its territory. that could complicate trump’s drive for friendlier relations with russian president vladimir putin. asked to comment on the reasons for pulling out of the georgia project, the trump organization sent reuters a joint statement with srg announcing the decision but not giving a reason. alan garten, the trump organization’s general counsel, said the organization stood by its statement and declined to comment on ramishvili’s assertion the deal was cancelled due to conflict of interest concerns. the trump transition team, which typically defers to the trump organization on business issues, did not respond to a request for comment. the trump organization has canceled licensing deals in  some other countries, including brazil and azerbaijan, but has not publicly cited conflict of interest concerns as the reason for those decisions. ramishvili said his company, one of the largest private investment companies in the south caucasus, would still go ahead with the batumi tower project. he said his company was ready to invest not less than the $250 million that was originally planned. “it won’t have trump’s name, but it may be called the fifth avenue tower as it will look similar to the trump tower in new york,” ramishvili said. ramishvili said he believed trump would “keep georgia on his mind” during his presidency. “i’m sure that president trump will always remember positive emotions that he had during his visit to our country, when he dubbed georgia as one of the amazing places in the world,” ramishvili said. “i’m happy that i’ve brought this iconic figure to georgia and i’m sure that he will be a great president.” ",0
" four u.s. states have sued interior secretary ryan zinke, the interior department and the u.s. bureau of land management to block new leases of public lands for coal mining, according to papers filed on tuesday in montana federal court. state prosecutors for california, new mexico, new york and washington are arguing new coal extraction would exacerbate global warming and violate the federal government’s statutory duty to use public lands “in a manner that will protect the quality of scientific, scenic, historical, ecological, environmental, air and atmospheric, water resource, and archaeological values,” according to the filings. the move was one of several recent attempts to block a broad pledge by u.s. president donald trump to roll back environmental regulations put in place under former president barack obama. the former president placed a moratorium on new coal mining leases on public lands more than a year ago, in january 2016.  on march 29, zinke, whom trump appointed interior secretary, formally lifted the ban. the prosecutors argued in addition to harming the environment, more coal mining on public lands would burden state and local governments with expenses related to healthcare, flood control and other infrastructure needs related to potentially harmful effects of nearby mines.  they also argued the united states’ “outdated structure” for collecting royalties from mining companies meant the government was not obtaining as much money for the leases as it deserved. a spokesman for the interior department declined to comment. a spokesman for the department of justice did not immediately respond to a request for comment. the case is state of new mexico et al v. united states department of the interior et al, u.s. district court, district of montana, 4 cv 00042.

" u.s. senate majority leader mitch mcconnell on tuesday joined a chorus of republican stalwarts publicly urging marco rubio to run for a second senate term in florida, as the party faces an uphill fight to maintain its control of the senate. “we’re doing everything to encourage him to run,” mcconnell said during an interview on msnbc’s “morning joe” program. some political strategists and senate republican aides see a potentially weak field of republican candidates for the florida senate seat and think rubio could help republicans hold their senate majority if he entered the race. he has until june 24 to decide if he wants to run in the aug. 30 republican primary. josh holmes, a former mcconnell chief of staff, said in a telephone interview that unlike many of the current republican candidates for the seat, rubio “still enjoys pretty high favorability and very high name id ratings in florida and the ability to raise a lot of money.” republicans now hold 54 of the chamber’s 100 seats. there are 44 democrats and two independents who align themselves with the democrats. mcconnell is trying to hold onto his job as senate majority leader but with 24 republican seats up for grabs in the nov. 8 elections and only 10 democratic seats in play, it will be a difficult bid. last week, senate foreign relations committee chairman bob corker said in a statement that he had “strongly encouraged” rubio to enter the race. rubio, a freshman senator elected in 2010, decided to retire from the senate and instead seek the u.s. presidency. but his effort came to an end in march after he was soundly defeated in the florida republican primary by donald trump, now the presumptive republican nominee for the nov. 8 election. in a cnn “state of the union” interview that aired on sunday, rubio was asked he if would ever seek public office in the future. “i think that’s a safe assumption,” he said, without elaborating. during the interview, rubio also said he would like to become commissioner of the national football league.

" saudi arabia s crown prince mohammed bin salman s recent political purge raises concerns and remains unclear but does not appear to amount to mass arrests, u.s. secretary of state rex tillerson told reporters on friday.  separately, tillerson said there was no indication that lebanon s former prime minister, saad al hariri, was being held in saudi arabia against his will but that the united states was monitoring the situation, according to a press pool report of his remarks. tillerson, who is traveling with president donald trump on an asia trip, made the comments following talks with his saudi counterpart this week. prince mohammed, saudi arabia s future king, has tightened his grip on power through an anti corruption purge by arresting royals, ministers and investors including billionaire alwaleed bin talal who is one of the kingdom s most prominent businessmen. he was among 11 princes, four ministers and tens of former ministers who were detained. asked about the saudi purge, tillerson said he had spoken with saudi foreign minister adel al jubeir about the situation on wednesday and that the recent crackdown did not yet amount to formal arrests.  based on that conversation, it s well intended. how disruptive it s going to be remains to be seen,  tillerson said, adding that the situation was  still a bit unclear.   it s my understanding that they re characterizing these as not really arrests at this point but they re presenting people with evidence of what they think the wrongdoing is to see if there s a willingness to want to make things right.    it raises a few concerns until we see more clearly how these particular individuals are dealt with,  tillerson added. his view contrasted with that of trump, who has praised the saudi purge and expressed confidence in the king and crown prince.  tillerson also said that jubeir had assured him that hariri s decision to resign was taken  on his own.  the united states was watching the situation  very carefully,  supporting  the legitimate government of lebanon  and  asking other outside parties to stay out of it,  he added.  if he s going to step down, as i understand it, he needs to go back to lebanon to make that official. i m hopeful that if that is still his intent to leave that he ll do that so that the government of lebanon can function properly,  tillerson said.

" bill clinton faced down protesters for 10 minutes at a presidential campaign rally in philadelphia for his wife, hillary clinton, over their criticisms that a 1994 crime bill he approved while president led to a surge in black people being imprisoned. several protesters heckled him and held signs, including one that read “clinton crime bill destroyed our communities.” video footage of hillary clinton defending the bill in 1994 by calling young people in gangs “super predators” who need to “be brought to heel” have been widely circulated during the campaign by activists in the black lives matter protest movement. bill clinton defended her 1994 remarks, which protesters say were racially insensitive.  “i don’t know how you would characterize the gang leaders who got 13 year old kids hopped on crack and sent them out on the street to murder other african american children,” he said, shaking his finger at a heckler as clinton supporters cheered, according to video of the event. “maybe you thought they were good citizens. she didn’t.”  hillary clinton, who also has faced protesters upset by her remarks, has said she regrets using the term.  bill clinton said last year that he regrets signing the violent crime control and law enforcement act into law because it contributed to the country’s high incarceration rate of black people for nonviolent crimes.

" many americans view islam unfavorably, and supporters of republican presidential candidate donald trump are more than twice as likely to view the religion negatively as those backing democratic presidential candidate hillary clinton, according to a reuters/ipsos online poll of more than 7,000 americans. it shows that 37 percent of american adults have a “somewhat unfavorable” or “very unfavorable” view of islam. this includes 58 percent of trump supporters and 24 percent of clinton supporters, a contrast largely mirrored by the breakdown between republicans and democrats. by comparison, respondents overall had an equally unfavorable view of atheism at 38 percent, compared with 21 percent for hinduism, 16 percent for judaism and 8 percent for christianity.  spokespeople for trump and clinton declined to comment. the poll took place before an attacker on thursday drove his truck into a holiday crowd in nice, france, killing more than 80 people in what president francois hollande called a terrorist act. police sources said the driver, while linked to common crimes, was not on a watch list of intelligence services and no islamist militant group immediately claimed responsibility for the attack. the race for the nov. 8 u.s. presidential election has put a spotlight on americans’ views of muslims with trump proposing a temporary ban on muslims entering the united states. he repeated the proposal after omar mateen, a new york born muslim armed with an assault rifle, killed 49 people in an attack on a florida gay nightclub last month.  the ideological divide between trump and clinton supporters is set against a backdrop of increasing violence and discrimination against muslims in the united states. the poll shows 78 percent of trump supporters and 36 percent of clinton supporters said that when compared to other religions, islam was more likely to encourage acts of terrorism. trump supporters were also about twice as likely as clinton supporters to say that islam was more encouraging of violence toward americans, women and gay people. polling on none of the other belief systems and their perceived connection to terrorism or violence came close to matching those numbers. clinton has called for a more inclusive environment within american society and for a joint effort between the u.s. government and muslim countries to battle the spread of islamist militancy.  she has criticized trump’s harsh statements about muslims and mexicans while trump has bemoaned what he calls american society’s devotion to political correctness. graphic: tmsnrt.rs/29ipj6l party affiliation accounted for the deepest division among americans where their views on muslims were concerned. respondents’ status as rich or poor, young or old, or male or female did not offer as pronounced an overall view as did their identification as democrats or republicans.  “if it was true that trump did not represent republicans broadly defined, you would think republicans would look different; they don’t,” said douglas mcadam, a sociology professor at stanford university who studies american politics. “it goes against the claims of the (former presidential candidate) mitt romneys of the world, that trump is not really a republican, that he doesn’t represent the republican party. he seems to be resonating with republicans generally.” according to the council on american islamic relations, a muslim civil rights group, attacks on american muslims and on mosques in the united states rose in 2015 to their highest level ever recorded.  the group said 31 incidents of damage or destruction of mosques were reported; there were 11 incidents in which a muslim person was the target of a slur or another kind of harassment.  the reuters/ipsos poll ran in all 50 states from june 14 to july 6. it included 7,473 american adults and has a credibility interval, a measure of accuracy, of 1 percentage point.

" u.s. senator marco rubio of florida said on wednesday he is  considering running for re election and may decide to jump into the race as early as this weekend, a move that could help republicans retain their majority in the u.s. senate.  “i’ll go home later this week. and i’ll have some time with my family. and then, if there’s a change in our status, i’ll be sure to let everyone know,” the former republican presidential candidate told reporters in the u.s. capitol.  rubio, 45, first elected to the senate in 2010, announced his retirement from the senate in march after losing florida’s presidential primary. but senate republican leader mitch mcconnell and others have been pressuring him to reconsider, citing polling data showing him to be the only republican who can win the election in florida.  rubio confirmed a politico report that he was urged to run for re election on sunday in orlando, florida, by one of the republicans contending for the seat, his friend lieutenant governor carlos lopez cantera. the two men were in orlando after the shooting that killed 49 people at a gay nightclub. another florida republican hopeful, u.s. representative david jolly, has indicated he would step aside if rubio entered the race. rubio must decide whether to seek re election by june 24, the filing deadline for florida’s august primary.

" a proposal driven by president donald trump to overhaul the country’s tax system is moving through u.s. congress, lifting the overall stock market and raising hopes that corporate earnings will get a boost. the s&p 500 .spx rallied this week as the drive to push sweeping tax legislation through the u.s. senate gained momentum, although gains were tempered by a report that former national security adviser michael flynn was prepared to testify that before taking office trump had directed him to make contact with russians. senate republicans said on friday they had gathered the votes needed to pass a sweeping tax overhaul. while negotiations are ongoing, the legislation could cut the corporate tax rate to as low as 20 percent from 35 percent. ubs strategists project that overall s&p 500 earnings would rise by 6.5 percent should the corporate tax rate fall to 25 percent and increase by 9.5 percent should the rate go to 20 percent.  but certain stocks could benefit more than others from the republican led plans. “it will be favorable to companies with primarily domestic business that are paying close to the full tax rate,” said john carey, portfolio manager at amundi pioneer asset management in boston. investors appear to have already rotated into some of these tax sensitive areas. some market watchers caution about generalizing winners, noting big differences in effective rates between companies in the same sectors.  but strategists point to industries with a concentration of companies poised to benefit, particularly from a lower corporate tax rate. (for a graphic on industries that stand to win from corporate tax cuts, click reut.rs/2zvjls9) (for a graphic on sector benefits from a corporate tax cut, click reut.rs/2amn9au) (high tax stocks underperform in 2017: reut.rs/2amdrp5) of the major s&p sectors, financials pay the highest effective tax rate at 27.5 percent, according to a wells fargo analysis of historical tax rates. brian klock, managing director in equity research at keefe, bruyette & woods who covers large regional banks, expects tax cuts to add 16 percent to median bank earnings in 2018 and 18 percent in 2019. “we’re assuming whatever the benefit is will drop right to the bottom line,” klock said. “they won’t give up on loan pricing or put any big investments in. with the increased capital they’ll return it to shareholders.” among large regional banks, zions bancorp (zion.o), m&t bank corp (mtb.n) and comerica inc (cma.n) stand to benefit the most, klock said. transportation ranks among the top industries expected to receive a big earnings boost from a lower corporate tax rate, according to ubs. u.s. railroads such as union pacific corp (unp.n) and csx corp (csx.o) are almost entirely exposed to the u.s. statutory rates, said morningstar analyst keith schoonmaker. railroads would benefit from provisions allowing them to expense their capital expenditures in one year as opposed to over time, lowering their taxable income, schoonmaker said. “we’ll see what comes out as far as the ability to depreciate immediately, but that certainly would be beneficial because they are all big capital spenders,” schoonmaker said, noting that railroads spend 18 percent to 20 percent of revenue on capital expenditures. airlines stand to gain from lower tax rates, analysts said, with ubs pointing to alaska air group inc (alk.n) and southwest airlines co (luv.n) as possible winners. domestically geared healthcare companies that focus on services would likely benefit more from tax rate reductions than pharmaceutical and medical device companies that sell their products overseas. “healthcare services is one of the most taxed industries and would be a big beneficiary of reductions in corporate tax rates,” lance wilkes, an analyst at bernstein, said in a recent note. the s&p 500 healthcare providers and services index .splrchcps, which includes health insurers such as anthem inc (antm.n), drug wholesalers like amerisourcebergen corp (abc.n), and hospital operators such as hca healthcare inc (hca.n), has gained 5.4 percent this week. according to leerink analyst ana gupte, a corporate tax rate cut to 20 percent could boost health insurer earnings by about 20 percent to 40 percent, but some of those gains would be expected to be passed through to employer and individual customers. other potential big winners include home health services company almost family inc (afam.o), lab testing company quest diagnostics inc (dgx.n) and pharmacy benefit manger express scripts holding (esrx.o), according to jefferies analyst brian tanquilut. department stores head the list of retailers that will benefit because they have among the heaviest u.s. exposure, said bridget weishaar, senior equity analyst at morningstar.  weishaar points to macy’s inc (m.n), nordstrom inc (jwn.n) and kohls corp (kss.n) as potential winners among department stores, as well as  victoria’s secret owner l brands (lb.n) and apparel retailer ross stores (rost.o). “retail companies will benefit from paying a lower tax rate,” weishaar said. “consumers hopefully will have additional cash, which will help consumer discretionary spending.” telecom companies, including at&t inc (t.n) and verizon communications inc (vz.n), also stand to gain. “they’re domestically focused companies with a very high percentage of their employee base in the u.s. and significant amounts of investments in u.s. infrastructure,” said amir rozwadowski, telecom equity analyst at barclays. “therefore they’re predisposed to benefit from tax reform.” at&t has climbed 4.9 percent this week, while verizon has surged 9 percent.

" a federal appeals court fired skeptical questions on monday at a lawyer for a u.s. congressional committee and a former staffer who argued that congress is immune from having to cooperate with an insider trading investigation. during a hearing, a three judge panel of the 2nd u.s. circuit court of appeals appeared to lean in favor of forcing congress to comply at least somewhat with two subpoenas from the u.s. securities and exchange commission. the case is a test of how far securities enforcers may go to police the murky world of “political intelligence,” in which firms seek to gather and sell information for traders.  the sec is investigating trading in humana inc stock in 2013 ahead of a government announcement about physician reimbursement rates, which affect humana and other health insurers. in court papers, the sec said it believes a congressional staff member at the time, brian sutter, “may have been a source” of an early leak to a lobbyist at the greenberg traurig law firm, who then passed the information to a height securities analyst, who in turn alerted clients. lawmakers and their staff are not immune from prosecution under insider trading laws.  but sutter and his former employer, the u.s. house of representatives’ ways and means committee, refused to comply with subpoenas for documents and testimony. their lawyers argued that they should be shielded from such investigative tactics because, under the legal principles of sovereign immunity and legislative independence, they cannot be questioned without their consent.  circuit judge richard wesley asked if sutter went beyond protected activity in talking to the lobbyist. “i don’t care what his job was at the ways and means committee; he wasn’t in charge of insider trading,” he said. william pittard, a lawyer for sutter and the committee, said it was not the court’s role to question the motives of congressional staff. sec lawyer jeffrey berger told the court that a ban on insider trading by congress would be an “empty shell” if the regulator lacked the power to investigate. the appeals court is expected to rule in the next several months. a humana spokesman could not be reached for comment. a greenberg traurig spokeswoman declined to comment. height securities said in a statement it has not received a subpoena from or been formally investigated by the sec.

" appeals judges at the yugoslav war crimes tribunal upheld on wednesday the convictions of six bosnian croats found guilty of war crimes and crimes against humanity during the 1990s, in the court s last verdict before it closes next month. the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia (icty), established by the united nations in 1993, is due to close when its mandate expires at the end of the year. the six former high level politicians and defense officials were convicted in 2013 of participating in an  ethnic cleansing  campaign against bosnian muslims.  they include jadranko prlic, a former defense minister, whose 25 year jail sentence was upheld on wednesday.  he had been found guilty of being part of a criminal enterprise by the wartime croatian government of late president franjo tudjman, to create an ethnically pure state. zagreb, which maintained it had  clean hands  in the bloody 1992 95 war in bosnia, had wanted that finding overturned.      however the appeals chamber concluded that it was not shown that the earlier judges had  misinterpreted relevant evidence  of tudjman and zagreb s confirmed croatia s role in the bosnian conflict. several convictions for specific crimes for prlic and the five others were reversed in the appeal, but president judge carmel agius said  all six remain convicted of numerous and very serious crimes.

" president elect donald trump’s shortlist of candidates to lead the u.s. department of interior has employees and environmental advocates fearful of a shift in the agency’s direction, from one focused on preserving public lands to one that would open them up to more drilling and mining. the outcome will have implications for industry access to millions of acres of national parks, reserves and tribal territories stretching from the arctic to the gulf of mexico and the viability of president barack obama’s efforts to keep the united states in line with international agreements to reduce the impacts of climate change. republican trump, a new york real estate businessman who has never previously held public office, has leaned toward right wing loyalists for the cabinet since winning the nov. 8 election. he is considering oil drilling advocates like oklahoma governor mary fallin, alaska’s former governor sarah palin and lucas oil co founder forrest lucas to run the interior department, media reports and reuters sources said. other contenders are several politicians from western states who favor easier development of public lands. any of those picks could trigger battles with environmental groups and cause internal strife at an agency where many workers see themselves as land stewards after nearly eight years of conservation minded policies under democrat obama. “public lands have been set aside to ‘preserve and protect’ cultural and scientific resources for future generations,” said geoff goins, a national park service ranger at the bandelier national monument in new mexico, adding that with trump coming in, “people are concerned about their jobs.”   other interior department employees interviewed by reuters said they were worried the agency’s environmental mandate would be weakened under trump, and green advocates said they were bracing to resist those changes. “climate change is a major focus of conservation concern for national parks,” said one national park service employee in the northwest who asked not to be identified. “if (trump’s administration) gets in the way of scientists...we are all in deep trouble.” during the election campaign, trump tweeted that “the concept of global warming was created by and for the chinese in order to make u.s. manufacturing non competitive”   a view that is at odds with most but a few scientists who study the impacts of rising global temperatures and extreme weather.        maureen finnerty, chair of the coalition to protect america’s national parks, an organization of more than 1,200 current and former national parks employees, said it was ready to launch a public relations campaign against trump if he pursues an anti environmental agenda. “we will be vigilant and hope for the best,” she said. the interior department employs more than 70,000 people across the united states and oversees over 20 percent of federal land. under obama, the interior department played a big role in efforts to curb the effects of climate change by limiting fossil fuel development in some areas. outgoing interior secretary sally jewell banned coal mining on public lands, canceled leases for drilling in the arctic and atlantic coasts, expanded wildlife protection and cracked down on industry methane emissions. the obama administration planned on using forest restoration on federal lands as a way to help the united states meet its long term goals under the 2015 paris agreement within the united nations framework convention on climate change. the agreement outlines how countries will deal with lowering greenhouse gas emissions starting in 2020.  trump has given mixed messages on his plans for interior. in an interview with field and stream magazine in january, trump said: “i want to keep the lands great... we have to be great stewards of this land.” but he has advocated strongly for boosting energy development on federal lands and has criticized obama’s use of environmental regulation to check oil and gas development. he picked renowned climate change skeptic myron ebell to run his transition at the environmental protection agency. u.s. representative kevin cramer of north dakota said trump could consider hiring as his energy secretary harold hamm, an oil and gas driller and a pioneer of developing shale oil resources. one potential interior department head is oklahoma governor fallin, who met with trump on monday. she has been an ardent supporter of oklahoma’s drilling industry and has blocked attempts to ban hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, a controversial drilling technology. fallin’s spokesman confirmed she is being considered for the post, but said there has been “no offer given.” also on the shortlist is palin, who made famous the motto “drill, baby, drill” when she was the vice presidential running mate to republican john mccain in 2008, and former arizona governor jan brewer, a trump supporter without experience in public lands policy. governor butch otter of idaho, venture capitalist robert grady and u.s. representatives cynthia lummis and rob bishop of wyoming and utah are also potential candidates for the job. all

" president elect donald trump’s team could move the white house press briefing room from the west wing to another location that accommodates more media from around the country and the world, senior officials in the incoming administration said on sunday. esquire magazine reported on saturday that the trump administration planned to relocate white house reporters from the press room to the white house conference center or the old executive office building next door. speaking on abc’s “this week,” incoming white house chief of staff reince priebus said on sunday that trump’s team discussed moving news conferences out of the small west wing briefing room to the old executive office building, which is part of the white house complex. such a move would mark a potential change in access for reporters as the current briefing room is only steps from the oval office.  vice president elect mike pence and priebus both said no decision had been made. trump has had a contentious relationship with some prominent u.s. news organization that he refers to derisively as the “mainstream media,” banning some news outlets during the presidential campaign and publicly criticizing individual reporters. on cbs’ “face the nation,” pence did not respond directly when asked whether potentially moving reporters was a logistical move or a punitive one. “the interest of the team is to make sure that we accommodate the broadest number of people who are interested and media from around the country and around the world,” pence said. tensions with trump escalated last week after some news organizations reported unsubstantiated allegations that suggested the president elect could be blackmailed by russia. at a raucous news conference last week in new york, trump pointedly refused to take a question from a cnn reporter and called the news outlet “fake news.” the white house correspondents’ association objected in a statement to “any move that would shield the president and his advisers from the scrutiny of an on site white house press corps,” and said it would fight to keep the briefing room and access to senior administration officials open. jeff mason, a reuters white house correspondent who is president of the association, said in a statement on sunday he met for nearly two hours with incoming white house press secretary sean spicer. mason said he made it clear the association “would view it as unacceptable if the incoming administration sought to move white house reporters out of the press work space behind the press briefing room” as trump’s team considers a larger briefing room. “access in the west wing to senior administration officials, including the press secretary, is critical to transparency and to journalists’ ability to do their jobs,” mason said. mason said spicer “expressed concern that journalists adhere to a high level of decorum at press briefings and press conferences. i made clear that the whca would object, always, to a reporter being thrown out of a briefing or press conference.” priebus said: “i know that some of the folks in the press are uptight about this, and i understand.” he said the only thing that had been discussed was whether or not the initial press conferences would be held in the existing press room that he said was “very, very tiny.” the current press room has about 49 seats. “so no one is moving out of the white house,” priebus said. the white house conference center had been used as a temporary press room during the george w. bush administration the briefing room was built in 1970 by richard nixon over an old swimming pool installed by franklin roosevelt that was used regularly by john f. kennedy but underutilized by later administrations. but the presence of reporters at the white house dates back even farther. in addition to theater style seats where the white house press secretary conducts daily briefings, the press area of the white house includes workspace for television, radio, print and online news organizations that cover the administration on a daily basis.

" u.s. president donald trump on wednesday will order a review of national monuments created over the past 20 years with an aim toward rescinding or resizing some of them   part of a broader push to reopen areas to drilling, mining and other development. the move comes as trump seeks to reverse a slew of environmental protections ushered in by former president barack obama that he said were hobbling economic growth   an agenda that is cheering industry but enraging conservationists. interior secretary ryan zinke told reporters on tuesday trump’s executive order would require him to conduct the review of around 30 national monuments and recommend which designations should be lifted or resized over the coming months. he said he would seek feedback from congressional delegations, governors and local stakeholders before making his recommendations. “i am not going to predispose what the outcome is going to be,” zinke said. rescinding or altering a national monument designation would be new ground for the government, he said. “it is untested, as you know, whether the president can do that,” zinke said. the monuments covered by the review will range from the grand staircase in utah created by president bill clinton in 1996 to the bears ears monuments created by president barack obama in december 2016 in the same state, covering millions of acres of land overlying minerals, oil and gas.  obama’s administration created the bears ears monument arguing that it would protect the cultural legacy of the navajo and four other tribes and preserve “scenic and historic landscapes.” but utah’s governor opposed the designation, saying it went against the wishes of citizens eager for development. the area lies near where eog resources (eog.n)   a texas based company   had been approved to drill. zinke said the broader aim of the order is to give states more input in the monument designation process, and “restore trust between local communities and washington.” while he acknowledged that national monuments could bring tourism, he said he thinks federal land should be managed for “multiple uses.”  conservation groups and native american tribal representatives slammed the looming order, suggesting it would be fought in court. “with this review, the trump administration is walking into a legal, political and moral minefield,” said kate kelly, public lands director for the center for american progress.  a summary of the forthcoming order, seen by reuters, said past administrations “overused” the antiquities act that allows presidents to create monuments.

" a group of philippine lawyers on wednesday filed an injunction with the supreme court to try to stop president rodrigo duterte s bloody war on drugs, calling it as an illegal campaign that lets police kill and circumvent legal procedures. the government s directive for the fierce 15 month old crackdown permits police to  negate  and  neutralise  targets, effectively granting them a license to kill suspected users and dealers, without gathering evidence or building a case, the lawyers said. a practice of compiling lists of  drug personalities  and encouraging citizens to anonymously provide names was tantamount to drawing up a hit list, the petition said. it called for judicial intervention in thousands of cases where filipinos were killed by police.  the present war on drugs being waged by the government is not going to stop illegal drugs, crime and corruption,  jose manuel diokno, chairman of the free legal assistance group (flag), told a news conference.  (it) will only result in the killing of more and more people especially the poor.   the petition comes as public scrutiny intensifies on duterte s signature campaign, which he insists will not stop, regardless of the bloodshed. he says he is prepared to go to jail to protect filipinos from crimes fueled by addiction. duterte rejects criticism that his notoriously bellicose public remarks have been interpreted by some police as veiled instructions to kill drug users, with impunity. philippine national police (pnp) spokesman dionardo carlos said police  welcome the filing of the petition before the supreme court . he did not elaborate. though filipinos are largely supportive of duterte s iron fisted approach, recent opinion polls indicate public doubts that his drugs war is above board and effective as the government says. analysts say unease about the campaign has contributed to duterte s ratings decline. pnp data shows 3,900 people have been killed in operations in which police say armed suspects violently resisted arrest. duterte s opponents and activists dispute that and say executions and cover ups are commonplace, which police deny. the petition by flag, which is comprised of around 200 pro bono human rights lawyers, was filed on behalf of three people whose relatives were killed by police. flag has also represented two men who testified before the senate that they were part of an alleged  death squad  that killed drug dealers and criminals at duterte s behest when he was davao city mayor, long before his presidency.  duterte dismisses the allegation as nonsense. the latest petition seeks to compel the pnp and the interior ministry to halt the campaign and wants killings to be examined by the national bureau of investigation (nbi), which would take charge of evidence, including guns that police say were used by victims. it said house to house visits by anti drugs police followed unverified tip offs from unknown informants and were not based on evidence. it argues police had no intent to persuade suspects to surrender and would kill anyone who refused to cooperate or denied involvement.  the government s war on drugs is short cutting the justice system by dispensing justice from the barrels of guns,  the petition said.

" a plan to raise california’s minimum wage to $15 an hour by 2022 passed both houses of the state legislature on thursday, putting the state on track to become the first in the nation to commit to such a large pay hike for the working poor. the measure, incorporating a deal governor jerry brown reached with labor leaders and progressive democrats in the legislature, was approved in the state senate thursday afternoon after winning approval earlier in the day in the assembly, and now goes to brown for his signature. “if you work full time, your family shouldn’t live in poverty,” assembly speaker anthony rendon, a southern california democrat, said in support of the bill to raise the state’s minimum wage from its current level of $10 per hour. lawmakers from the state’s poorer regions said the measure could harm small businesses that are barely hanging on amid double digit unemployment, ultimately leading to job losses. if enacted, the bill would put california, home to one of the world’s biggest economies, among a growing number of u.s. states and cities that have moved in recent years to surpass the federal minimum wage, which has remained at $7.25 an hour since 2009. a proposal to raise the minimum wage in parts of new york state to $15 was announced thursday by governor andrew cuomo and legislative leaders. the california measure would gradually raise the state’s hourly minimum wage to $15 by 2022 for large businesses and by 2023 for smaller firms. the measure would also head off two competing ballot initiatives lacking a provision to allow the governor to suspend increases in hard economic times, a deal breaker for brown. the proposal sped through the legislative process after the governor’s office reached a deal last week with labor unions pushing a similar minimum wage hike in the form of two ballot initiatives. with polls showing strong support for those measures at the ballot box, brown emphasized that a version passed through the legislature would allow lawmakers to amend it if needed over time instead of going back to voters to request amendments in expensive and uncertain campaigns. moreover, the deal allows the state to opt out of minimum wage increases if the economy is doing poorly, a provision not in either of the union backed ballot initiatives. even so, several moderate democrats and most republicans complained that it was being rushed through, and would disproportionately harm businesses in poorer parts of the state, where the cost of living is not high enough to warrant such a dramatic wage hike. the deal reached in new york would raise wages in costly new york city to $15 in three years, but would stagger increases in other parts of the state, some to just $12.50 per hour unless further approval is granted. it still must pass the legislature, where negotiations on the details are ongoing.

" washington state’s attorney general has promised to uncover “what truly motivated” president donald trump’s executive order on immigration, an approach that could prompt a rare public examination of how a u.s. president makes national security decisions.  the presidential order imposed a temporary ban on travelers from seven predominantly muslim countries, but a federal judge has barred enforcement of the order while the court considers a challenge brought by washington state.  on thursday, the u.s. court of appeals for the 9th circuit left the judge’s ruling in place without deciding the ultimate merits of either side’s arguments. in its decision, the 9th circuit cited a previous case establishing that “circumstantial evidence of intent, including … statements by decisionmakers, may be considered in evaluating whether a governmental action was motivated by a discriminatory purpose.”  the trump administration has argued that the ban is necessary to prevent potential terrorists from entering the country and is not discriminatory because the text of the order does not mention any particular religion.  washington attorney general bob ferguson signaled on sunday that he will move aggressively to obtain written documents and emails authored by administration officials that might contain evidence the order was unconstitutionally biased against muslims or islam. he also said he would also move to depose administration officials. legal scholars say this could move the court into uncharted waters.  “the idea of looking at motive has never really been applied to the president,” said john yoo, a former justice department lawyer in the george w. bush administration.      “it would represent a serious expansion of judicial oversight of what the president and the entire executive branch does,” said yoo, now a professor at the university of california at berkeley school of law.  trump has harshly criticized the federal judge in washington for his decision and a top white house aide on sunday accused the 9th circuit of a “judicial usurpation of power.”  “the president’s powers here are beyond question,” senior policy adviser stephen miller told fox news sunday. u.s. courts have historically been careful about probing the motives behind laws, in part out of respect for the separation of powers between branches of government. but on questions of racial or religious discrimination, they have sometimes allowed intent to be examined.  in 1993, for instance, the supreme court found that an ordinance banning animal sacrifice in hialeah, florida, though neutral on its face, was actually intended to discriminate against a santeria church, which holds sacrifice as a sacred rite. stephen griffin, a professor of constitutional law at tulane university, said cases like this make it clear that the court can look beyond the words of trump’s executive order. “motive is relevant,” he said.  one question in the current case is likely to be which, if any, of trump’s statements should be admissible in examining the administration’s motives in issuing the order.  “if you’re allowed to use evidence from the campaign, the state’s case is very strong,” said  griffin. in december, 2015, days after a mass attack by an islamic state sympathizers in san bernardino, california, trump called for “a total and complete shutdown of muslims entering the united states until our representatives can figure out what is going on.” he later said he supported only suspending immigration from areas with a history of terrorism. stanford university law school professor michael mcconnell, a former federal appeals judge, said the court should not consider campaign statements, because trump only swore an oath to uphold the constitution after he became president.  in its complaint, washington cited an interview the president did on the day the order was signed with the christian broadcasting network, saying he would prioritize christians in the middle east for admission as refugees.   legal experts are divided on whether the state’s lawyers should be allowed to question the president’s advisers – and possibly even the president – in depositions. the white house could potentially claim executive privilege, which protects the president and other officials from subpoena, said thomas lee, an expert in constitutional law at fordham university.  anna rose mathieson a partner with the california appellate law group said that one person who might be more easily deposed would be presidential adviser and former new york city mayor rudolph giuliani, who told fox news the president had asked him to put a commission together to figure out how to make a muslim ban legal. david pressman, a partner at boies schiller flexner and former assistant secretary of homeland security in the obama administration, said there are important protections in place so that the executive branch can receive national security advice. “you don’t want a situation in which courts are adjudicating intelligence that is coming to the executive when trying to formulate policy,” said pressman. though in this case, pressman said he did not believe the national security argument for the order was clear, opening the door to further questioning. the next steps in the case are not certain.  the trump administration has said it is considering appealing the 9th circuit ruling to the supreme court, and the 9th circuit itself might decide to rehear the case with a larger panel of judges. the president has also said he might replace the order with “a brand new” one, which could end the current legal action.

" the trump administration on friday dropped a lawsuit accusing north carolina of discriminating against lgbt residents after the state replaced its “bathroom bill”, although a key civil liberties group vowed to keep fighting the new law in court. in a two sentence court filing the justice department said it had dropped its lawsuit, filed last year by the obama administration, because the north carolina legislature had replaced it with a new law called house bill 142. the filing marks the first significant move in a complicated legal battle challenging the state’s nondiscrimination laws since the replacement of the original law, known as house bill 2 or more commonly as the “bathroom bill.” house bill 2’s most controversial provision was the requirement that in state run buildings transgender people use the bathrooms, changing rooms and showers that corresponded to the sex on their birth certificates rather than their gender identity. a number of businesses and sports leagues boycotted north carolina because they saw the year old law as discriminatory against the lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (lgbt) community. civil liberties groups also protested the move. the american civil liberties union, the aclu of north carolina, and lambda legal filed a lawsuit challenging the law in march of last year. that was followed in may by the justice department’s own suit against house bill 2. james esseks, the aclu’s lgbt project director said the new law is flawed because it keeps a ban on cities and counties from creating their own nondiscriminatory ordinaces until 2020 and relegates to the state legislature the power to regulate bathroom access. the legislature has purposefully not taken any action to define access, he said. house bill 142 “leaves transgender people in limbo and that’s intentional,” esseks said. “this does not fix the problem. it creates confusion.” esseks said his group planned to amend their lawsuit soon to challenge the new bill.

" plans for the first contact between north korea and the united states after president donald trump took office were canceled after the u.s. state department denied a visa for the top envoy from pyongyang, the wall street journal reported on saturday. the talks, between senior north korean foreign ministry envoy choe son hui and former u.s. officials, were scheduled to take place on march 1 and 2 in new york but were called off after choe was denied a visa, the journal said. it was not clear what led the state department to deny the visa but north korea’s test firing of a ballistic missile on feb. 12 and the murder of north korean leader kim jong un’s half brother in malaysia may have played a role, the report said. south korean and u.s. officials have said they believe north korean agents assassinated kim jong nam, the estranged half brother of kim jong un, on feb. 13. a u.s. state department official denied so called track two discussions had been scheduled. “the u.s government had no plans to engage in track 2 talks in new york,” the official said, declining comment on individual visa cases. a south korean foreign ministry official declined to comment on the report of the canceled meeting in new york, saying the reported plan did not involve the u.s. or south korean government. the meeting in new york would have been the first time a senior north korean envoy would visit the united states since 2011 and the first contact between u.s. and north korean representatives since trump took office. choe, director general for north american affairs at the north’s foreign ministry, has previously met former u.s. officials and academics, the last time in november in geneva for informal discussions. trump said in a reuters interview on thursday that he was concerned about north korea’s ballistic missile tests and “it’s a very dangerous situation”. trump did not ruling out meeting kim at some point in the future under certain circumstances but suggested it might be too late.

" the white house said on wednesday it will redirect $589 million in funds to prepare for the zika virus before the mosquito that carries it begins to emerge in the continental united states, but urged congress to act quickly on its request for more money. white house budget director shaun donovan said the use of money previously provided for fighting another health crisis, the ebola virus, was only a temporary fix for zika funding. donovan said some measures to fight zika would have to be delayed, curtailed or stopped unless the u.s. congress approves more than $1.8 billion in emergency funds requested by the obama administration in february. the zika virus, linked to a growing number of cases of the birth defect microcephaly in brazil, is spreading rapidly in latin america and the caribbean and heading north as the weather gets warmer. “we should not play with fire here,” donovan told reporters on a conference call. without full zika funding, u.s. health and human services secretary sylvia mathews burwell said mosquito control and surveillance may have to be delayed or stopped, vaccine development could be jeopardized and development of faster diagnostic tests could be impaired. most of the $589 million will come from $2.7 billion in funds set aside for public health projects aimed at the ebola virus. west africa was stricken by a two year ebola epidemic that killed more than 11,300 people starting in december 2013 and led to a small number of cases in the united states. the republican controlled congress has said the white house should draw the money needed to fight zika from the ebola funds. chairman hal rogers and other top republicans on the house of representatives appropriations committee said in a statement they would “monitor the changing needs resulting from this unpredictable crisis” to ensure that needed funds are available. “republicans are going to look back on this time that they’ve had to act on the zika virus and deeply regret it,” white house spokesman josh earnest said. burwell said a recent flare up of ebola in west africa shows the united states cannot shortchange its work in the region. “we face two global health challenges, ebola and zika, and we don’t have an option to set one aside in the name of the other,” burwell told reporters. burwell said there were 672 confirmed cases of zika infections in the united states, including 64 pregnant women. she said there was one confirmed case of zika related microcephaly in hawaii. the world health organization has said there is a strong scientific consensus that zika can cause microcephaly as well as guillain barre syndrome, though proof may take months or years. microcephaly is a condition defined by unusually small heads in babies that can result in developmental problems. guillain barre syndrome is a rare neurological disorder that can result in paralysis. brazil said it has confirmed more than 940 cases of microcephaly, and considers most to be related to zika infections in the mothers. brazil is investigating nearly 4,300 additional suspected cases of microcephaly.

" president donald trump plans to sign a repeal of obama era broadband privacy rules as a bigger fight looms over rules governing the openness of the internet, the white house said on wednesday. republicans in congress on tuesday narrowly passed the repeal of the privacy rules with no democratic support and over the strong objections of privacy advocates. the fight over privacy sets the stage for an even larger battle later this year over republican plans to overturn the net neutrality provisions adopted by the administration of former president barack obama in 2015. white house spokesman sean spicer said he did not know when trump would sign the bill. the privacy bill would repeal regulations adopted in october by the federal communications commission under the obama administration requiring internet service providers to do more to protect customers’ privacy than websites like alphabet inc’s google or facebook inc. under the rules, internet providers would need to obtain consumer consent before using precise geolocation, financial information, health information, children’s information and web browsing history for advertising and marketing. the reversal is a win for at&t inc, comcast corp and verizon communications inc. websites are governed by a less restrictive set of privacy rules overseen by the federal trade commission. republican commissioners have said the rules would unfairly give websites the ability to harvest more data than internet service providers.  senate democratic leader chuck schumer said in a tweet the vote was “terrible for american ppl, great for big biz.” republicans next plan to overturn net neutrality provisions that in 2015 reclassified broadband providers and treated them like a public utility.     fcc chairman ajit pai, a republican, in december said he believes that net neutrality’s days are numbered. the rules bar internet providers from obstructing or slowing down consumer access to web content and prohibit giving or selling access to speedy internet, essentially a “fast lane” on the web’s information superhighway, to certain internet services. critics say the rules opened the door to potential government rate regulation, tighter oversight and would provide fewer incentives to invest billions in broadband infrastructure. pai told reuters in february be backs “a free and open internet and the only question is what regulatory framework best secures that” but has steadfastly declined to disclose his plans.  trump has not talked as president about net neutrality but in 2014 tweeted he opposed net neutrality.

" arms provided by the united states and saudi arabia to syrian opposition groups frequently ended up in the hands of islamic state, an arms monitoring group that analyzed weapons found on the battlefield said on thursday. conflict armament research (car) said most islamic state weapons were looted from the iraqi and syrian armies. but some were originally provided by other countries, mainly the united states and saudi arabia, to syrian opposition groups fighting against president bashar al assad.  these findings are a stark reminder of the contradictions inherent in supplying weapons into armed conflicts in which multiple competing and overlapping non state armed groups operate,  the group said in a 200 page report. car documented at least 12 cases of weaponry purchased by the united states that ended up in islamic state s hands, either captured on the battlefield or acquired through shifting alliances within the syrian opposition. most of these items later ended up in iraq, the monitor said. in one case, it took only two months for islamic state fighters in iraq to get their hands on a guided anti tank missile the united states bought from a european country and supplied to a syrian opposition group. all of the items were made in eu states, and in most cases the united states broke contractual clauses prohibiting retransfers by giving the weapons to armed groups in syria.  evidence collected by car indicates that the united states has repeatedly diverted eu manufactured weapons and ammunition to opposition forces in the syrian conflict. is forces rapidly gained custody of significant quantities of this materiel.  car said it similarly traced numerous items used by islamic state back to exports from bulgaria to saudi arabia, and that these were also subject to non retransfer clauses that should have barred them from being supplied to syrian warring parties. around 90 percent of weapons and ammunition used by islamic state in syria and iraq were made in china, russia, and eastern european countries, car said, with china and russia alone accounting for over 50 percent.  these findings support widespread assumptions that the group initially captured much of its military materiel from iraqi and syrian government forces,  the report said. russian made weapons used by islamic state in syria outnumbered chinese ones,  presumably reflecting russian supplies to the syrian regime,  car said. russia is allied with assad and launched air strikes in syria in september 2015, its biggest middle east intervention in decades, turning the tide of the conflict in his favor. on saturday iraq declared final victory over islamic state, which seized more than a third of the country s territory in 2014. last week russia declared victory over the group in syria. car reported last year that islamic state had been making its own weapons on a scale and with sophistication matching national military forces, and that it had standardized production across its realm. link to the car report: here ",0

" members of the u.s. congress said on tuesday operations carried out against the rohingya muslims in myanmar had  all the hallmarks  of ethnic cleansing, while the country s leader aung san suu kyi expressed doubts about allegations of rights abuses. the u.s. senate members also said they were disturbed by a  violent and disproportionate  security response to rohingya militant attacks that have driven more than 600,000 people from myanmar to neighbouring bangladesh. human rights monitors have accused myanmar s military of atrocities, including mass rape, against the stateless rohingya during so called clearance operations following insurgent attacks on 30 police posts and an army base. myanmar s government has denied most of the claims, and the army last week said its own probe found no evidence of wrongdoing by troops.  we are not hearing of any violations going on at the moment,  suu kyi told reporters in response to a question about human rights abuses at the end of the asia europe meeting, or asem, in myanmar s capital naypyitaw.  we can t say whether it has happened or not. as a responsibility of the government, we have to make sure that it won t happen.  nobel laureate suu kyi said she hoped talks with bangladesh s foreign minister this week would lead to a deal on the  safe and voluntary return  of those who have fled. suu kyi s less than two year old civilian government has faced heavy international criticism for its response to the crisis, though it has no control over the generals it has to share power with under myanmar s transition to power after decades of military rule. while a top un official has described the military s actions as a textbook case of  ethnic cleansing , u.s. secretary of state rex tillerson on a visit to myanmar last week refused to label it as such. in early november, u.s. lawmakers proposed targeted sanctions and travel restrictions on myanmar military officials. democratic senator jeff merkley, who was among the sponsors of the legislation introduced in the senate, led a congressional delegation that visited rakhine this week, but was blocked from traveling to the violence hit north of the state and to rohingya camps. the group also traveled to cox s bazar district in bangladesh, where rohingya refugees are huddled into makeshift camps and fed by overstretched aid agencies.  many refugees have suffered direct attacks including loved ones, children and husbands being killed in front of them, wives and daughters being raped, burns and other horrific injuries. this has all the hallmarks of ethnic cleansing,  merkley told reporters in myanmar on tuesday.  we are profoundly disturbed by the violent and disproportionate response against the rohingya by the military and local groups,  he said. the delegation called for myanmar to allow an investigation into the alleged atrocities that would involve the international community.  we want to emphasize that the world is watching,  merkley said, adding that it was important myanmar allow anyone who wants to come back to return to their homes and their farms. merkley said the delegation was  not here today to recommend what the u.s. government would do or should do,  when asked about the legislation introduced in the congress. myanmar officials have so far said they plan to resettle most returnees in new  model villages , rather than on the land they previously occupied, an approach the united nations has criticized in the past as effectively creating permanent camps.  individuals cannot be coming back simply to return to camps where there would be continued discrimination, restrictions on full participation in the economy and society,  said merkley. he warned that isolating people in camps creates a  two tier society that is fundamentally incompatible with the future of democracy and it guarantees perpetuation of suspicions and misunderstandings and conflicts.  speaking earlier on tuesday, suu kyi said discussions would be held with the bangladesh foreign minister on wednesday and thursday about repatriation. officials from both countries began talks last month on how to process the rohingya wanting to return.  we hope that this would result in an mou signed quickly, which would enable us to start the safe and voluntarily return of all of those who have gone across the border,  suu kyi said. the rohingya are largely stateless and many people in myanmar view them as illegal immigrants from bangladesh. suu kyi said myanmar would follow the framework of an  agreement reached in the 1990s to cover the earlier repatriation of rohingya, who had fled to bangladesh to escape previous bouts of ethnic violence. that agreement did not address the citizenship status of rohingya, and bangladesh has been pressing for a repatriation process that provided rohingya with more safeguards this time.  it s on the basis of residency...this was agreed by the two governments long time ago with success, so this will be formula we will continue to follow,  suu kyi said. earlier talks between the two countries reached a broad agreement to work out a repatriation deal, but a senior myanmar official later accused bangladesh of dragging its feet in order to secure funding from aid agencies for hosting the refugees.

" russian hacking of the 2016 u.s. election included sophisticated targeting of state officials responsible for voter rolls and voting procedures, according to a top secret u.s. intelligence document that was leaked and published this week, revealing another potential method of attempted interference in the vote. the month old national security agency document outlined activities including impersonating an election software vendor to send trick emails to more than 100 state election officials. analysts at the nsa believed the hackers were working for the russian military’s general staff main intelligence directorate, or gru, according to the document. the document’s publication on monday by the intercept, a news outlet that focuses on security issues, received particular attention because an intelligence contractor, reality leigh winner, was charged the same day with leaking it. u.s. intelligence agencies have previously said the kremlin tried to influence the election outcome in favor of republican candidate donald trump through leaks during the campaign of hacked emails from democratic party officials, aimed at discrediting democratic candidate hillary clinton. the new revelations suggest that u.s. investigators are also still probing a more direct attempt to attack the election itself, and a federal official confirmed that is the case. however, there is no evidence that hackers were able to manipulate votes, or the vote tally. the document says at least one employee of the software vendor had an account compromised but does not cover whether any of the elections officials were also successfully compromised. if they did compromise the officials, hackers could have planted malicious software, then captured proof of the infection to suggest that there had been fraud on clinton’s behalf, had she won the nov. 8 election, experts said. “if your goal is to disrupt an election, you don’t need to pick the winner or actually tamper with tally result,” said matt blaze, a university of pennsylvania computer science professor who has written on the security of voting machines. simply casting doubt on the legitimacy of the results could achieve the goals of a government sponsored hacking campaign, he said.  u.s. intelligence officials had previously stated that russian intelligence had won access to “multiple” election officials but had said that compromised machines were not involved with vote tallies. but they had not said how sophisticated and extensive the effort was or how it worked. russian president vladimir putin has strongly denied russian government involvement in election hacking, though he said last week that “patriotic” russians could have been involved. trump has denied any collusion. spear phishing on elections officials the newly leaked nsa report said the hackers used so called “spear phishing” techniques on election officials, trying to convince targets to click on links in emails that seemed to come from legitimate correspondents. the report describes just one phishing campaign, which hit state officials a week before the election, but does not give any locations or say if it was successful. although there may have been many others, security experts said one coming so late in the game would be more likely to be about sowing chaos than  trying to alter vote counts.  the report did not say what the hackers were trying to accomplish, and any investigation of the computers of people who were targeted would be the jurisdiction of the fbi. an fbi spokeswoman declined to comment tuesday, as did the office of the special counsel robert mueller, who is investigating possible collusion between trump campaign officials and the russian government. the “bait” used in the spear phishing campaign involved software for managing voter registration rolls. the hackers might have been considering deleting some records and forcing officials to turn legitimate voters away, said elections technology security expert alex halderman, of the university of michigan. there were no wide reports of mass rejections of voters, so perhaps that plan was abandoned or proved too hard to execute, he said. it is also possible that the idea was to get onto the machines of officials who oversaw both registration and voting software. elections are run by counties in the united states.  “depending on the county’s configuration and security practices and what is separated from what, they could have access to potentially every aspect, from lists of registered voters, to voting  machines, to firmware on those machines, to the ballots that are presented, to the software that controls the final tally,” blaze said. “this is the holy grail of what an attacker would want to compromise.”  members of congress said they hoped to learn more about the hacking attempts. “it’s important that the american people understand that the russian attempts to break into a number of our state voting processes   we talked about this in the fall   was broad based,” democrat mark warner, vice chairman of the senate intelligence committee, told reporters. “it’s my hope in the coming days that we can get more information out about that.” ",0
" the u.s. house of representatives will vote wednesday on a sweeping proposal to speed the deployment of self driving cars without human controls and bar states from blocking autonomous vehicles, congressional aides said. the bill, which was passed unanimously by a house panel in july, would allow automakers to obtain exemptions to deploy up to 25,000 vehicles without meeting existing auto safety standards in the first year, a cap that would rise to 100,000 vehicles annually over three years. automakers and technology companies including general motors co and alphabet inc’s’ self driving unit waymo have been pushing for new federal rules making it easier to deploy self driving technology. meanwhile, some consumer groups have sought additional safeguards.  the bill will be voted under fast track rules that do not allow for amendments. a bipartisan group of u.s. senators has been working on similar legislation but has not introduced a bill. “self driving vehicles stand to make our transportation system safer and more efficient. advancing this technology to road ready requires government policy that encourages continued testing and development,” house majority leader kevin mccarthy, a republican, said in a statement. “this formula is the foundation for what makes america the most innovative country in the world.”   the alliance of automobile manufacters, a trade group, said in a statement that “congress can bring a host of benefits to americans by helping to bring self driving vehicles to our roads as quickly as possible.” republicans representatives greg walden and robert latta said in a joint statement the “vote will pave the way for the safe testing, development, and deployment of self driving cars across the u.s.” the issue has taken on new urgency since u.s. road deaths rose 7.7 percent in 2015, the highest annual jump since 1966. automakers and technology companies believe chances are good that congress will approve legislation before year end. current federal rules bar self driving cars without human controls on u.s. roads and automakers think proposed state rules in california are too restrictive. the measure, the first significant federal legislation aimed at speeding self driving cars to market, would require automakers to submit safety assessment reports to regulators, but would not require pre market approval of advanced vehicle technologies. initially, authors proposed to allow automakers and others to sell up to 100,000 vehicles immediately. representative frank pallone, a democrat, said the phase in period was essential so “millions of exempted cars will not hit our roads all at once.” manufacturers must demonstrate self driving cars winning exemptions are at least as safe as existing vehicles. under the house proposal, states could still set rules on registration, licensing, liability, insurance and safety inspections, but could not set self driving car performance standards. consumer advocates have sought more changes, including giving the national highway traffic safety administration quicker access to crash data and more funding to oversee self driving cars.

" prosecutors in vietnam on thursday said they were seeking the death sentence in an embezzlement case against a former chairman of state energy firm petrovietnam, as the communist country steps up one of its biggest corruption crackdowns. some high ranking political officials have been punished as investigations widen into petrovietnam and the banking sector, with dozens of banking and energy officials facing trial on charges such as embezzlement, mismanagement and abuse of power. in a statement, the supreme people s procuracy of vietnam said it had sought a death sentence for the former chairman, nguyen xuan son, on charges that include wrongdoing with serious economic consequences and abuse of power to usurp assets. it urged  an overall penalty of death , listing punishments such as a jail term of 16 to 18 years for flouting state rules on economic management and life imprisonment for abuse of power, before seeking the  death sentence for embezzlement . in 2009, petrovietnam acquired an 800 billion dong ($35 million) stake in ocean group s banking unit, ocean bank, which had to be completely written off in 2015, when the central bank took it over at no cost.  son could not be reached for comment as he is on trial, and reuters could not immediately reach his lawyer. prosecutors also sought life imprisonment for ocean group s founder, tycoon ha van tham on charges ranging from embezzlement to abuse of power, the statement said, adding that dozens of other ocean bank staff could also face years in jail. ocean group, which has interests in real estate, finance, hotels and infrastructure, said it had no comment on the sentence sought for tham, who cannot be reached as he is still on trial. police opened three new cases against state firm units, among them russian joint venture vietsovpetro, vietnam s sole refinery operator binh son refining and petrochemical, and petrovietnam exploration production corp. all three cases focus on alleged abuse of power to usurp assets and are linked to violations at ocean bank, vietnam s police said in a statement on their website on thursday. police added another accusation of abuse of power against petrovietnam s vice general director ninh van quynh, they added, following his arrest and prosecution this month for alleged wrongdoing. quynh could not be contacted for comment on the fresh charge as he is on trial. last week a former central bank governor was prosecuted for alleged lack of responsibility. dinh la thang, a former petrovietnam chairman, was removed from the powerful politburo and last month, a vice trade minister was sacked.

" top lawmakers from both major u.s. political parties said on sunday they trusted the justice department to appropriately handle its probe of presidential candidate hillary clinton’s private email server, after a heavily criticized meeting between clinton’s husband and the u.s. attorney general. republican senators lindsey graham and john mccain said on cbs show “face the nation” that they would respect attorney general loretta lynch’s decision on whether to prosecute clinton, the likely democratic presidential nominee.  congressman adam schiff, the top democrat on the house intelligence committee, also said he respected the process, though he acknowledged lynch’s private meeting last week at an airport with former president bill clinton was unfortunate. “i think both of them wish their airplanes had never come anywhere near each other,” schiff said on “face the nation,” adding that he still had confidence in the doj and the federal bureau of investigation to do a thorough investigation of clinton’s email use. “if they say they are going to conduct this investigation by the book, i believe that’s what’s going to happen,” said schiff, who supports clinton for the party’s nomination. lynch said on friday that she would accept whatever recommendations the career prosecutors working on the case made about whether to prosecute clinton. the lawmakers’ endorsement for the process follows clinton’s meeting saturday with investigators at the fbi’s washington headquarters, where she answered questions for three and a half hours as part of the probe into use of her private email server. the fbi is investigating clinton’s email use and whether laws were broken as a result of a personal email server kept in her chappaqua, new york, home while she was secretary of state from 2009 to 2013. lawmakers and political strategists speculated on sunday that the fbi’s interview of clinton signaled its investigation could be nearing its end. but the fbi offered no information about the status of the probe or who its targets may be. clinton has long insisted she is not a target. clinton herself said in comments to msnbc on saturday that she “was pleased to have the opportunity to assist the department in bringing its review to a conclusion.” her rival, presumptive republican nominee donald trump, said it was “impossible” for the fbi not to recommend criminal charges against her. the two have already begun an acrimonious battle ahead of the presidential election on nov. 8. democrats are hoping the issue will be resolved before their four day convention in philadelphia that begins july 25, which is expected to culminate with clinton’s nomination for the presidential race. it is unclear what democrats would do if clinton were to be indicted and if any contingency plan exists.   not all lawmakers said they were confident the justice department could maintain impartiality. tom cotton, a republican senator, said on nbc’s “meet the press” on sunday he thought lynch’s meeting with bill clinton “raises questions about political interference in this investigation.” ",0

" hurricane irma will pose the toughest test yet for u.s. nuclear power plants since reactors strengthened their defenses against natural disasters following the fukushima daiichi nuclear accident in japan in 2011. irma was on course to hit south florida early on sunday after slamming cuba as a category 5 storm. it weakened to a category 3 storm with maximum sustained winds of 130 miles per hour (210 km per hour) on saturday, but was expected to strengthen before reaching florida, bringing a storm surge to a state home to four coastal nuclear reactors. the national hurricane center s forecast track shows irma making landfall on the southwest side of the florida peninsula, west of the two nuclear reactors at the turkey point plant.  the operator, florida power & light (fpl), has said it will shut turkey point well before hurricane strength winds reach the plant. the reactors are about 30 miles (42 kilometers) south of miami. fpl said it will also shut the other nuclear plant in florida at st lucie, which also has two reactors on a barrier island on the state s east coast, about 120 miles (193 km) north of miami.  we will shut the reactors down 24 hours before category 1 force winds are forecast to hit,  fpl chief executive eric silagy told a news conference. fpl said both turkey point and st lucie were designed to withstand storms stronger than any ever recorded in the region and both plants are elevated 20 feet (6 meters) above sea level to protect against flooding and extreme storm surges. but south miami mayor philip stoddard said he was concerned about the potential for floods to damage power generators at turkey point, which in turn might threaten the ability of the plant to keep spent nuclear fuel rods cool. at fukushima in japan, an earthquake and tsunami disrupted power supplies and caused the fuel in some units to meltdown.   the whole site is pretty well able to handle dangerous wind, the real problem from my perspective is water,  stoddard said. he said he was more worried about the nuclear waste than the reactors.  the real question is can they keep the spent fuel cool.  peter robbins, an fpl spokesman, said  mayor stoddard is wrong. turkey point is safe and is ready for hurricane irma.  u.s. nuclear operators have taken steps to improve preparations for disasters since fukushima. the u.s. nuclear regulatory commission (nrc) required plants to install portable pumps and generators to keep water moving over fuel rods and the spent fuel pool even if offsite power supply was lost. nuclear plants also hired more staff and stored equipment needed to deal with reactor problems.  things are better today than in march 2011. time will tell whether better proves good enough,  said dave lochbaum, director of a watchdog group, the nuclear safety project, at the union of concerned scientists. the nrc said it was posting more inspectors at the two florida plants and was considering sending more inspectors to plants in georgia and south carolina should the storm head that way. the nrc said the plants should not be compromised by irma s storm surge.  the storm surge forecasts that we have seen so far do not challenge the sites  designs,  said nrc spokesman scott burnell. both florida plants have previously weathered major storms. turkey point took a hit from hurricane andrew, a category 5 storm, in 1992, damaging a smokestack at fossil fuel plant at the site. repairs cost about $90 million. st lucie withstood the back to back impact of hurricanes frances (category 2) and jeanne (category 3) in 2004. fpl shut st lucie last october as hurricane matthew skirted the florida coast. lochbaum said the nrc and the industry could do more to reduce vulnerability to flooding. in january 2014, about 50,000 gallons of rainwater leaked into the st lucie plant after a heavy downpour. an nrc study blamed degraded and missing flood seals that were not discovered during checks after fukushima. there is also spent nuclear fuel at the site of a third power plant in florida which stopped operating in 2009. that is the crystal river plant, owned by duke energy corp (duk.n). duke is in the process of transferring used fuel from the spent fuel pool at the plant to dry cask storage as part of work to decommission the plant. once in storage, the fuel no longer needs cooling.  the nrc s burnell said duke has suspended work to transfer the rods ahead of irma. he said the fuel was safe and the plant also has backup power, even though it has been shut for years. irma is expected to disrupt much of florida s power supply. fpl, the state s largest electric company, has warned irma could cut service to about 4.1 million of its nearly 5 million customers. fpl is one of four large publicly traded utilities in florida. other natural disasters since fukushima have shut some plants. an earthquake in virginia in 2011 shut dominion energy inc s (d.n) north anna plant for about 2 1/2 months, the time it took to complete a full damage inspection. that plant sustained no major damage.  hurricane sandy in 2012 caused three reactors in the u.s. northeast to shut but inflicted no serious damage.

" storm battered puerto rico, with a population of 3.4 million, is still without electricity five days after hurricane maria struck with ferocious winds and torrential rains, the most powerful hurricane to hit the u.s. territory for nearly a century. eighty percent of the power lines in puerto rico are down, the island s electricity utility prepa said on monday. prepa spokesman carlos monroig said the utility is evaluating all of puerto rico s electrical infrastructure by air.  the following are responses from multinational companies with a presence in puerto rico on how they are dealing with the aftermath of maria: wal mart stores inc wal mart spokesman phillip keene said:  we don t have a timetable yet on being fully operational, but we are working very hard to recover operations on the island as quickly as possible. as of this morning, hundreds of loads of water, emergency supplies and other needed resources like generators have either been delivered to the island or are on the way there. we will send trucks to open stores and those that are able to accept deliveries as soon as safely possible. no details to share on economic or operational impact.  lisa belot, media relations at sprint, said:  due to the severe damage caused by hurricane maria and the impact on sprint s network, technical staff have mobilized to review the state of our sites in puerto rico and to expedite the reconstruction process to reestablish communication as quickly and safely as possible for all of our customers. our first shipment has already arrived in puerto rico with generators and parts required for restoration, and crews of engineers and technicians from the u.s. have already joined the local team on the island. a second shipment is scheduled to arrive on wednesday.  the company said:  we are closely monitoring our network in puerto rico and working to address the full effects of hurricane maria. storm damage is significant across the region and commercial power is unavailable, both of which can affect our ability to provide service. and, unfortunately, some cleanup crews working in the area have accidentally damaged additional communications infrastructure.  we are coordinating with local authorities and deploying resources as rapidly as possible to assist in restoration and recovery efforts as quickly as conditions allow.  nat lia salom o, global corporate media relations at drugmaker and consumer johnson & johnson, said:  our preliminary assessment is that our physical facilities fared well given the magnitude of the storm. we are partnering with local and federal authorities to monitor the state of the infrastructure.  while we helped our employees and campuses prepare, we continue to work with customers and our emergency aid partners to restock products and relief supplies that have been in heavy demand. prior to the storm, we took steps to adjust our raw material and product supply flow to account for potential interruptions, and we will continue to assess the situation.  bristol myers squibb co         bristol myers squibb spokesman ken dominski said:  puerto rico sustained significant damage, and our primary concern is with our employees, their families and the citizens of puerto rico.  we have some damage to one of our three facilities, however we are executing contingency plans that we believe mitigates product supply risk as we assess the situation on the island and work to bring our operations back online. we are contacting employees to provide support in their recovery from hurricane maria while the bristol myers squibb foundation is responding with a $250,000 cash donation to support emergency relief efforts.  scott sayres, a spokesman for honeywell international, said the company s focus is on making sure their employees are safe.  they re still working on it ... our folks on the ground are making sure everyone s accounted for and what their needs are ... we re still assessing the facilities.

" orlando nightclub killer omar mateen had expressed sympathy for a variety of islamist extremists, including groups in the middle east that are sworn enemies, the fbi said on monday, as a picture began to emerge of the angry, violent man who carried out america’s deadliest mass shooting. u.s. authorities said they had found no direct links between islamic state and mateen, the u.s. born son of afghan immigrants who killed 49 people at a gay nightclub in orlando on sunday.        mateen, 29, was shot dead by police who stormed the pulse club with armored cars after a three hour siege. in 911 calls during his rampage, the killer expressed allegiance to islamic state leader abu bakr al baghdadi.     but federal bureau of investigation director james comey  said mateen had made comments favorable to multiple armed islamist movements and people, which “adds a little bit to the confusion about his motives.” president barack obama said mateen was likely a homegrown extremist.  “so far, we see no indication that this was a plot directed from outside the united states and we see no indication that he was part of any kind of network,” comey told reporters in washington. “we’re highly confident this killer was radicalized at least in some part through the internet.”     islamic state, which controls territory in iraq and syria, reiterated on monday a claim of responsibility, although it offered no signs to indicate coordination with the gunman.         in calls to authorities on sunday, mateen also mentioned support for the boston marathon bombers and a florida man who became a nusra front suicide bomber in syria, comey said. nusra is an al qaeda offshoot which is at odds with islamic state in syria’s civil war.         co workers reported mateen to the fbi in 2013 after he had made “inflammatory and contradictory” statements, including a claim that he had family connections to al qaeda and membership of shi’ite militant group hezbollah, a bitter rival. the fbi’s miami office investigated mateen for 10 months and interviewed him twice but found no evidence of a crime or connection with a militant group. comey said the fbi was also “working to understand what role anti gay bigotry may have played” in the attack.  the massacre reverberated on the presidential campaign trail, where republican donald trump and democrat hillary clinton, the two likely opponents in the nov. 8 election, clashed over how to confront violent islamist extremists.     trump proposed suspending immigration to the united states from countries with a history of terrorism against america, europe or u.s. allies, while clinton warned against demonizing muslims and called for tougher gun safety measures. obama is to visit orlando on thursday to pay respects to families of the victims. the orlando killings followed the massacre of 14 people in san bernardino, california, last year and raised the question of whether the united states will have to confront jihadist attacks in the homeland for years to come.  comey said tracking apparent lone wolf attackers like mateen was like finding “needles in a nationwide haystack” while also trying to work out what kind of people could become radicalized. the florida shooting spree began early on sunday when the club was packed with some 350 revelers at a latin music night. many fled as the gunman raked the crowd with bullets from an ar 15 style semiautomatic rifle and a pistol. an initial wave of officers charged into the club and trapped mateen in a bathroom, orlando police chief john mina told reporters. that allowed many patrons to flee, although others were trapped in the restroom with mateen, leading to a standoff. police negotiated with mateen for about three hours before breaking a hole in the wall, which allowed hostages to escape. mateen also emerged from the hole and was shot dead by officers, police said. some 53 people were wounded and 29 remain hospitalized at orlando regional medical center. michael cheatham, chief trauma surgeon at the hospital, told fox news he expects all of the survivors in the hospital to survive.  amanda alvear’s last snapchat video post began with a shot of her on the dance floor of the nightclub surrounded by friends. it ended with gunshots ringing out over the music. alvear, 25, was identified by police as one of those killed at pulse. her friend mercedez flores, 26, who worked for target,  was also on the list. another victim was edward sotomayor, 34, a marketing manager at a florida based gay themed travel company. he was a legend in the industry, his boss, al ferguson, said.  pastor deyni ventura visited a survivor in the hospital, whom she identified only as norman, who had taken refuge in a handicapped bathroom stall crammed with 30 people. norman could hear the shooter laughing loudly as he sprayed gunfire over and under the bathroom stall. “they couldn’t see the shooter but they could hear him laughing,” ventura said, intimating a loud cackling laugh. norman, who was shot four times, crawled over the bodies of his friends to safety. everyone else in the stall died, ventura said. most of the people fatally shot were latino, more than half of them of puerto rican origin and at least three of them mexican citizens. hundreds of people attended a vigil on monday night for the dead in downtown orlando.         law enforcement officials searched for clues as to whether anyone had worked with mateen on the attack, said lee bentley, the u.s. attorney for the middle district of florida. but officials said they believed there had been no other attackers and had no evidence of a threat to the public. mateen’s ex wife, sitora yusifiy, described him as mentally unstable and violent toward her. “he would get mad out of nowhere. that’s when i started worrying about my safety and then after a few months he started abusing me physically very often,” she told reporters. the couple split in 2009 after four months of marriage.     when mateen met with his father the day before the killing, he betrayed nothing of the rage that would soon erupt. “i didn’t notice anything wrong,” seddique mateen said in an interview. “he was very slick.” in the close knit muslim community of about 100 families in fort pierce, florida, mateen was known as quiet with few friends. “he wasn’t a people person. he was not extremely friendly but he wasn’t rude either,” said mohammed jameel, 54, who worshipped at his mosque.     mateen was an armed guard at a gated retirement community, and had worked for the global security firm g4s (gfs.l) for nine years..          he told the fbi during its investigation of him that he had made pro islamist remarks because he was angry at co workers who he felt were discriminating against him and teasing him for being a muslim, comey said.

" kentucky state representative dan johnson, who was facing sexual assault accusations, died in a probable suicide on wednesday, bullitt county coroner dave billings said.  johnson, 57, also the leader of the louisville area heart of fire church, held a news conference on tuesday at which he denied accusations contained in a report by the kentucky center for investigative reporting. the report, published earlier in the week, included accusations from a woman that johnson molested her in 2013 when she was a teenager. johnson, whose press conference was widely reported by local media, also defied calls by some legislators to step down. on wednesday evening, johnson was found dead in a probable suicide from a single gunshot wound near louisville, the coroner said, adding that an autopsy would be performed on thursday. billings said law enforcement officials had been searching for johnson after someone read a post on his facebook page,  became concerned and contacted police. the post has since been taken down, but the courier journal reported that it appeared to be a farewell and read in part, “the accusations from npr are false, god and only god knows the truth. nothing is the way they make it out to be.” the death comes amid a national reckoning over sexual harassment and abuse that has included allegations of misconduct in a number of state legislatures, including in kentucky. kentucky republican jeff hoover recently resigned his post as speaker of the kentucky house of representatives under a cloud of sexual harassment allegations. “saddened to hear of tonight’s death of ky representative dan johnson,” kentucky republican gov. matt bevin wrote on twitter. “my heart breaks for his family tonight...these are heavy days in frankfort and in america...may god indeed shed his grace on us all...we sure need it.” michael skoler, president of louisville public media, which operates the investigative reporting center, said in a statement on social media that the organization reached out to johnson numerous times during its seven month investigation but that he declined to discuss the group’s findings. johnson was elected in 2016 despite becoming known for a 2016 facebook post comparing president barack obama and michelle obama to monkeys, wdrb tv has reported.

" president donald trump s administration is ending a program that allowed children fleeing violence in el salvador, guatemala and honduras to apply for refugee status in the united states before leaving home.  the administration will phase out the central american minors (cam) program during fiscal year 2018, according to a report provided to congress and obtained by reuters. that report also sets the overall refugee cap for the year at its lowest level in decades.  the cam program started at the end of 2014 under the administration of former president barack obama as a response to tens of thousands of unaccompanied minors and families from central america who arrived at the u.s. mexico border seeking asylum in the united states.   the program allowed vulnerable young people with parents in the united states to process their applications in their home region and avoid making the dangerous trip through mexico to the u.s. border on their own, said karen musalo, the director of the center for gender and refugee studies at university of california hastings.   i think there is very little interest in understanding on the part of this administration as to who are refugees and our country s commitment to protect people fleeing persecution,  musalo said. the report said it was ending cam  because the vast majority of individuals accessing the program were not eligible for refugee resettlement.  the government will instead focus on  more targeted  refugee processing in central america, working with the government of costa rica, the united nations and the international organization for migration, the report said. the u.s. had already said in august it was ending one element of the program. an executive order on border security signed by trump days after he took office in january triggered a review of the program, putting on hold the applications of more than 2,700 children who had been conditionally approved for entry into the united states. those applications   the bulk of which were for children from el salvador   have been canceled.  as of august 4, more than 1,500 children and eligible family members had arrived in the united states as refugees under the cam program since it began in december 2014, according to the state department. more than 13,000 people have applied for the program since it began, it said.

" u.s. law enforcement officials have charged 301 suspects with trying to defraud medicare and other federal insurance programs in 2016, marking the “largest takedown” involving health care fraud allegations, the justice department said on wednesday. the national sweep resulted in charges against doctors, nurses, pharmacists and physical therapists accused of fraud that cost the government $900 million, the department said.      the cases involved an array of charges, including conspiracy to commit health care fraud, money laundering and violations of an anti kickback law.  this year’s sweep exceeded last year’s record in which 243 defendants faced charges in a combined $712 million in government losses. officials said it was the largest takedown in the nine year history of the medicare fraud strike force, a joint initiative between federal, state and local law enforcement. attorney general loretta lynch said some of the cases reflect new, troublesome trends, including instances of identity theft in order to prepare fake prescriptions and a growing number of cases involving compounding, or the mixing of medications tailored to meet a patient’s needs. compounded medications are typically very expensive. from 2012 to 2014, the quarterly medicare spending on these prescriptions skyrocketed from $28 million to $171 million. “as this takedown should make clear, health care fraud is not an abstract violation or benign offense,” lynch said. “it is a serious crime.”  in one case, two owners of a group of outpatient clinics and a patient recruiter stand accused of filing $36 million in fraudulent claims for physical therapy and other services that were not medically necessary.  the justice department said that to find patients, the clinic operators and the recruiter targeted poor drug addicts and offered them narcotics so they could bill them for services that were never provided. another case was filed against the operator of a marketing business that received referral fees from pharmacies that filled and billed tricare, the u.s. military’s government insurance program, for compounded medicines.  the prescriptions were submitted via “telemedicine” sites, and doctors were given blank prescription forms to fill out, regardless of medical necessity, according to the complaint. one doctor told the fbi her identity and medical credentials were used without her permission to fill thousands of dollars worth of prescriptions.",0
" the u.s. senate judiciary committee voted on tuesday to confirm senator jeff sessions as attorney general of the united states, sending president donald trump’s pick to be the nation’s top law enforcement officer to the full senate for a final vote. the role got a higher profile on monday night when the republican president promptly fired acting attorney general sally yates for refusing to enforce his executive order temporarily banning all refugees and travelers from seven predominantly muslim countries from entering the united states. yates was a holdover from the obama administration. sessions, a 70 year old senator from alabama and a close trump ally since the early days of his presidential campaign, was likely to support the executive order. one of his former staffers, stephen miller, helped shape the document from the white house. sessions’ allegiance to trump, his hard line immigration positions and civil rights record came under scrutiny during his 10 1/2 hour hearing before the committee on jan. 10.  trump’s justice department is likely to operate in sharp contrast to the agency under obama. civil rights groups say the choices trump has made in his appointments to leadership roles at the department show that the agency is preparing to neglect or even weaken civil rights protections. hours after trump’s inauguration, the administration appointed thomas wheeler and john gore to serve as interim leaders in the department’s civil rights division. wheeler, the current acting head of the division, defended in private practice a school that confiscated a student’s breast cancer awareness bracelet for being “inappropriate;” a public school that held a christmas show in which bible excerpts were read and religious songs were sung; and the walgreens drugstore chain in a case in which a pharmacist looked up the birth control records of a customer and shared them with the customer’s ex boyfriend. gore, who will serve as deputy assistant attorney general in charge of voting rights and employment litigation, helped defend state election redistricting plans that were challenged on grounds that they violated the voting rights act.

" the trump administration s announcement on sunday that it is issuing new travel restrictions on people entering the united states from eight countries could lead to an upcoming supreme court case on its previous more controversial ban ending in a whimper rather than a bang. the new presidential proclamation set restrictions on citizens from eight countries and is set to go into effect on oct. 18, eight days after the court is due to hear oral arguments over the legality of trump s earlier ban. the trump administration on sunday night asked the high court to considering hearing new briefing on the case before the oral argument to address  the effects of the proclamation on the issues currently pending before the court in these cases.  now the nine justice court could skip deciding the case altogether, legal experts said. the march 6 order under supreme court review banned travelers from six muslim majority countries and limited refugee admissions. challengers say the order discriminated against muslims in violation of the u.s. constitution. a decision on that issue would be consequential not just for trump but also future presidents who would be bound by it. but with the challenged policy no longer on the books, the court has various options to resolve the dispute without issuing a ruling. the 90 day travel ban, which covered iran, libya, somalia, sudan, syria and yemen, ran until sunday. the 120 day refugee ban expires on oct. 24. even before trump s latest announcement, experienced supreme court lawyers and immigration law experts had expressed doubts about whether the nine justices would want to issue a decisive ruling, in part because of a desire to stay out of such a contentious issue.      if the court can avoid entering into the fray, that may be appealing to them,  said anil kalhan, an immigration law professor at drexel university school of law. with the travel restrictions expiring, the court has an easy way out because it could simply say that the case is no longer a live issue and therefore, in legal parlance, moot. the supreme court has already intervened three times since march in limiting the scope of lower court rulings that struck down the march order. its most significant act came in june when it allowed both bans to go into effect in a limited fashion. the unsigned decision suggested that the court s four liberals and two of its conservative majority, chief justice john roberts and justice anthony kennedy, were keen on a compromise. three other conservatives, including trump appointee neil gorsuch, said both bans should have been allowed to go into effect in full. the trump administration has yet to say what it would prefer the court to do, but former justice department lawyers say it is likely to request that if the court does dismiss the case, it also throws out the lower court rulings that struck the bans down. the benefit for the administration is that it would wipe out those precedents, including the broad decision by the richmond based 4th u.s. circuit court of appeals that said the order discriminated against muslims. the decision cited trump s campaign statements in concluding that the order was motivated by anti muslim bias. the trump administration says the order was needed for national security reasons.  it s certainly in the government s interest to get the adverse ... opinions off the books because those decisions constrain executive authority,  said washington lawyer pratik shah, who previously worked at the justice department. the march order took effect on june 26, following a supreme court ruling that narrowed the scope of lower court rulings. litigation continued over the summer on who exactly was covered by the bans, culminating in a supreme court decision on sept. 12 that allowed trump to enforce the refugee ban broadly but kept lower court restrictions that prevent close family members from being denied entry. the march 6 order was itself trump s second attempt to impose a travel ban after his original, much broader jan. 27 plan was blocked by lower court following turmoil at u.s. airports caused by its abrupt rollout.

" the u.s. supreme court on monday handed a victory to president donald trump by allowing his latest travel ban targeting people from six muslim majority countries to go into full effect even as legal challenges continue in lower courts. the nine member court, with two liberal justices dissenting, granted his administration’s request to lift two injunctions imposed by lower courts that had partially blocked the ban, which is the third version of a contentious policy that trump first sought to implement a week after taking office in january.  the high court’s action means that the ban will now go fully into effect for people from chad, iran, libya, somalia, syria and yemen seeking to enter the united states. the republican president has said the travel ban is needed to protect the united states from terrorism by islamic militants.  in a statement, attorney general jeff sessions called the supreme court’s action “a substantial victory for the safety and security of the american people.” sessions said the trump administration was heartened that a clear majority of the justices “allowed the president’s lawful proclamation protecting our country’s national security to go into full effect.” the ban was challenged in separate lawsuits by the state of hawaii and the american civil liberties union. both sets of challengers said the latest ban, like the earlier ones, discriminates against muslims in violation of the u.s. constitution and is not permissible under immigration laws.  trump had promised as a candidate to impose “a total and complete shutdown of muslims entering the united states.” last week he shared on twitter anti muslim videos posted by a far right british party leader. “president trump’s anti muslim prejudice is no secret   he has repeatedly confirmed it, including just last week on twitter,” aclu lawyer omar jadwat said. “it’s unfortunate that the full ban can move forward for now, but this order does not address the merits of our claims. we continue to stand for freedom, equality and for those who are unfairly being separated from their loved ones,” jadwat added. lower courts had previously limited the scope of the ban to people without either certain family connections to the united states or formal relationships with u.s. based entities such as universities and resettlement agencies. trump’s ban also covers people from north korea and certain government officials from venezuela, but the lower courts had  already allowed those provisions to go into effect. the high court said in two similar one page orders that lower court rulings that partly blocked the latest ban should be put on hold while federal appeals courts in san francisco and richmond, virginia weigh the cases. both courts are due to hear arguments in those cases this week. the supreme court said the ban will remain in effect regardless of what the appeals courts rule, at least until the justices ultimately decide whether to take up the issue on the merits, which they are highly likely to do. the court’s order said the appeals courts should decide the cases “with appropriate dispatch.” “we agree a speedy resolution is needed for the sake of our universities, our businesses and most of all, for people marginalized by this unlawful order,” hawaii attorney general douglas chin said. justices ruth bader ginsburg and sonia sotomayor said they would have denied the administration’s request. monday’s action sent a strong signal that the court is likely to uphold the ban on the merits when the case likely returns to the justices in the coming months. there are some exceptions to the ban. certain people from each targeted country can still apply for a visa for tourism, business or education purposes, and any applicant can ask for an individual waiver. the san francisco based 9th u.s. circuit court of appeals will hear arguments on the merits of hawaii’s challenge on wednesday in seattle. the 4th u.s. circuit court of appeals will arguments on the merits of case spearheaded by the aclu on friday in richmond.  trump issued his first travel ban targeting several muslim majority countries in january, then issued a revised one in march after the first was blocked by federal courts. the second one expired in september after a long court fight and was replaced with the present version. the trump administration said the president put the latest restrictions in place after a worldwide review of the ability of each country in the world to issue reliable passports and share data with the united states. the administration argues that a president has broad authority to decide who can come into the united states, but detractors say the expanded ban violates a law forbidding the government from discriminating based on nationality when issuing immigrant visas. the administration has said the ban is not discriminatory and pointed out that many muslim majority countries are unaffected by it.

" china on wednesday urged people in the united states to take a rational and objective view of the relationship between the two countries, after republican front runner donald trump became the party’s presumptive presidential nominee. trump has proposed that tariffs on imported chinese goods be increased to up to 45 percent and asserted that china had waged “economic war” against the united states, taking american jobs. on sunday, he compared the u.s. trade deficit with china to rape. china is the united states’ largest trading partner. asked whether china was worried at the prospect of a trump presidency, after his commanding win in indiana and as top rival ted cruz bowed out of the race, foreign ministry spokesman said the election was as internal affair he could not comment on.  “what needs to be pointed out is that the essence of sino us trade and business cooperation is mutually beneficial and win win, and accords with the interests of both sides,” hong told a daily news briefing.  “we hope people in all fields can rationally and objectively view this relationship,” he added, without elaborating. chinese officials have generally avoided criticizing trump directly, though they have made indirect criticism of his proposal to ban muslims from entering the united states and indirectly rebuffed his assertion that china is stealing u.s. jobs. however, last month finance minister lou jiwei criticized trump, calling him “an irrational type” due to his tariffs proposal on imported chinese goods. the united states reported a $366 billion trade deficit with china in 2015, up from $343 billion in 2014   the largest u.s. trade imbalance with any nation. china’s tightly controlled state media has largely stuck to reporting the facts about trump, with some notable exceptions. in march, influential tabloid the global times accused trump of being a racist, warning that other extremists, such as benito mussolini and adolf hitler, had both been voted into power. reacting to trump’s triumph on wednesday, the official xinhua news agency noted he could beat likely democratic nominee hillary clinton if he toned down his “explosive rhetoric”. “despite being a celebrity outside the united states, clinton, the former first lady and secretary of state, simply neither excites nor galvanizes her base,” it said in an english language piece. in a separate report, xinhua said trump “gets them wrong, from trade balance to basic economics”, citing western media and academics dismissing his criticisms of trade with china. “trump attacks china to woo voters,” it said.

" one would expect voters from the heavily democratic brooklyn neighborhood of cobble hill to pick presidential candidate hillary clinton in the nov. 8 general election. just don’t expect them to advertise it. like lawns and windowsills in liberal pockets across the country, much of the neighborhood is bereft of pro clinton signage in the final weeks before the election. it’s a stark contrast to the 2012 and 2008 campaigns, when president barack obama whipped up a frenzy of support from democrats and his signature “hope” and “forward” signs were ubiquitous.  the scarcity of lawn and window signs is an indication of the democratic nominee’s struggle to generate enthusiasm among left leaning voters, a challenge that’s borne out in polling data, and could potentially haunt her if voters fail to turn out on election day. clinton leads republican challenger donald trump by four percentage points among likely voters, according to a reuters/ipsos poll released friday.  but americans of all political stripes have been more critical of clinton than they were of obama when he was running for his second term four years ago, according to the daily tracking poll.  among democrats, 78 percent say they have a favorable view of clinton, lower than the 89 percent favorability rating obama had at this point in the race in 2012. clinton’s favorability drops to 28 percent among independents versus obama’s 47 percent. nancy kimmel viola, a 63 year old social worker who lives about a mile away from clinton’s campaign headquarters in brooklyn, keeps a “bernie 2016” sticker taped to the front door of her carroll gardens home, a vestige of her support for the unsuccessful bid of sen. bernie sanders. while she plans to vote for clinton, she confesses that her “heart’s not in it.” “i have to vote for her.” viola said. “having trump in there is too scary.” in denver, residents in the democratic stronghold of park hill posted many yard signs over a local zoning issue, but few for the presidential race. “most of us around here will vote democratic, we always do, but we’re not overly enthusiastic for clinton,” said resident pablo marron. “but we are united in our opposition to trump.” in the heavily democratic denver suburb of northglenn, banners for local office seekers littered a major roadway, but there were no accompanying clinton signs. in the affluent liberal washington dc suburb of chevy chase, maryland, signs for the democratic nominee appeared only roughly once every 10 blocks. the lack of enthusiasm isn’t just hitting the clinton campaign. americans from both major parties say they are generally less interested in voting this year than they were in 2012, according to the reuters/ipsos opinion poll, which compared results gathered during the first 20 days of september with the same period of 2012. the clinton campaign did not respond to emailed requests for comment. clinton’s online store displayed roughly a dozen different signs and banners for sale, ranging from an 11 inch by 17 inch sign, sold at $10 for a pack of two, to a four foot by six foot “hillary for america” banner, which retailed for $100. sales data was not immediately available and a request for comment from the store went unanswered. for some, there is a “hold your nose quality” to this election, said matthew dallek, associate professor at george washington university’s graduate school of political management. “the lack of signage” in liberal enclaves may indicate, dallek said, “that there just isn’t this sort of enthusiasm that existed for obama.” but there are some blocks that buck the trend. on a street in gowanus, brooklyn, no fewer than four homes bore pro clinton signage, including a life size cutout of the democratic nominee, which rests in the windowsill of retired lawyer chris morrison’s home. the beaming cardboard clinton prompts many passersby to take pictures, said morrison, a staunch clinton supporter. “you don’t see as much signage this time around. in this neighborhood i don’t get so concerned (because everyone is) more or less on the same page,” said morrison, 66. “i worry when i go to some other places.” ",0
" chancellor angela merkel s conservatives widened their lead over the social democrats following a television debate in which merkel came across as more convincing and reliable than her spd challenger martin schulz, a poll showed on thursday. the weekly survey by infratest dimap for ard television showed support for merkel s cdu/csu bloc holding steady at 37 percent while the spd dropped two percentage points to 21 percent   their lowest reading in the poll since early january. the pollster questioned 1,503 voters from monday to wednesday, meaning the survey was the first fully conducted after sunday s television debate in which hardly any policy differences emerged between merkel and schulz. the anti immigration, euro hostile afd came in unchanged at 11 percent, making it the third strongest political force. the radical left followed with 10 percent, up 1 point. the business friendly fdp scored 9 percent, also up 1 point, while the environmental greens were unchanged at 8 percent. the polls indicated two parties fdp and the afd should enter the bundestag as they look set to beat the 5 percent threshold. the fractured political landscape could make it hard to form a viable alliance other than the current grand coalition between merkel s cdu/csu and the spd. another scenario could be a tricky three way  jamaica  coalition between merkel s conservatives, the fdp and the greens, though such a broad alliance has never been tested on the federal level before.

" u.s. health and human services secretary tom price promised on thursday to repay the nearly $52,000 cost of his seats on private charter flights, as expensive air travel by trump administration officials drew sharp scrutiny from congress. “today, i will write a personal check to the u.s. treasury for the expenses of my travel on private charter planes,” said price, a former member of congress, in a statement. “the taxpayers won’t pay a dime for my seat on those planes.” price was one of a handful of senior officials in president donald trump’s administration put on the defensive over reports about their use of charter flights and government aircraft, sometimes for personal travel, when they could have flown commercial for less money.  price told fox news on thursday that trump had spoken to him about the matter and was not happy. asked if he retained trump’s confidence, price said he worked at the president’s pleasure. washington media outlet politico reported that price had taken at least two dozen private charter flights since may at a cost to u.s. taxpayers of more than $400,000. politico in a report on thursday night said the white house had approved the use of military aircraft for other trips by price to africa, europe and asia in the spring and summer that cost taxpayers more than $500,000. “secretary price will write a personal check to the u.s. treasury for $51,887.31,” a spokeswoman for the department of health and human services said on thursday. price is paying his individual share of the charter flight cost, an hhs official said. price said earlier on thursday he believed he retained trump’s confidence. senior u.s. government officials travel frequently, but are generally expected to keep the costs down by taking commercial flights or the train when possible. price, environmental protection agency administrator scott pruitt and treasury secretary steve mnuchin were all in the spotlight for their travel habits. politico reported late on thursday that interior secretary ryan zinke took a charter flight from las vegas to glacier park international airport in montana in june that cost $12,375. the route is served by commercial flights. zinke also took charter flights between st. croix and st. thomas in the u.s. virgin islands in march and used a military aircraft to travel to norway in may, according to politico. “as with previous interior secretaries, the secretary traveled on charter flights when there were no commercial options available,” interior department spokeswoman heather swift said in a statement. “all travel is pre approved by the ethics office before booking and the charter flights went through an additional level of due diligence.”  republican senator chuck grassley urged trump in a statement “to emphasize to cabinet secretaries the necessity of using reasonable and cost effective modes of travel in accordance with federal restrictions.” in his statement, price said his travel had been approved by legal and departmental officials. but he expressed regret over the concerns raised and pledged to take no more private charter flights while health secretary. “i was not sensitive enough to my concern for the taxpayer,” said price, an orthopedic surgeon. he was confirmed in february as health secretary despite questions about how he had been buying shares in publicly traded healthcare companies while working on legislation affecting them. as a conservative republican u.s. representative in 2009, price chastised “the fiscal irresponsibility” of private plane use by government officials in an appearance on cnbc television that he also posted on twitter. price’s travels and those of the entire trump cabinet are being probed by a u.s. house of representatives committee.  senate democrats wrote to price on thursday demanding information about his flights.         the inspectors general at hhs, epa and treasury are investigating to see if government travel rules were followed. the epa’s inspector general said last month it was investigating pruitt’s frequent travels to his home state of oklahoma. the washington post reported on thursday that pruitt had taken at least four noncommercial and military flights since mid february, costing taxpayers more than $58,000. epa spokeswoman liz bowman said pruitt did use one charter flight but that other commissioned flights were done on government planes. “the administrator flies commercial, unless there is a necessity to do otherwise, and with approvals from epa’s ethics office,” said epa spokesman jahan wilcox. at the treasury department, the inspector general is reviewing mnuchin’s use of a government plane to fly to kentucky in august for a visit to louisville and fort knox. mnuchin and his wife viewed the solar eclipse during the trip. on the “cbs this morning” program on thursday, mnuchin said he would use military planes in the future only when there are national security issues or “there’s no other means” of travel.

" the u.s. senate on wednesday confirmed president donald trump’s pick to head the interior department as the white house seeks to increase fossil fuel production on federal lands. ryan zinke, a u.s. representative from coal producing montana, won confirmation by a vote of 68 to 31, with several democrats joining republicans, who lead the chamber. the former navy seal commander is an avid hunter and angler who is popular with many outdoor enthusiasts, including trump’s son donald jr.  many environmentalists, however, are concerned about zinke’s zeal for exploiting coal and other fossil fuels. as a one term congressman, zinke worked to boost mining, including supporting an effort to end a coal leasing moratorium on federal lands. forty percent of u.s. output comes from federal lands that are  mostly in wyoming and montana. in his confirmation hearing in january zinke said he would consider an expansion of energy drilling and mining on federal lands but would ensure that sensitive areas were protected.  democrats who voted against zinke, including senators maria cantwell and chuck schumer, questioned his support of fossil fuel development on federal lands. “congressman zinke says he’s a dyed in the wool conservationist, but doesn’t have the record to back it up,” said schumer, the senate’s top democrat. “that should concern every outdoor enthusiast, every lover of our great and grand national parks.” zinke will head an agency that employs more than 70,000 people across the country and oversees more than 20 percent of federal land, including national parks such as yellowstone and yosemite. fellow republican senator steve daines, also from montana, said zinke “knows we must strike a balance between conservation and responsible energy development.” the white house is expected to issue an executive order soon reversing former president barack obama’s temporary moratorium on coal leasing on u.s. lands, which is part of a wider review of the program. the senate is also expected to easily confirm trump’s pick to head the department of energy, rick perry, a former governor of texas, this week.

" vietnamese police on friday arrested a former top communist party official suspected of misconduct while he was chairman of the main state energy firm, the first former politburo member to face prosecution in decades. police issued arrest and prosecution orders for dinh la thang, 56, for suspected  violation of state regulations on economic management, causing serious consequences , the ministry of public security said on its website.     thang is the most senior official so far caught up in a widespread crackdown on fraud in the energy and banking sectors, which has gathered pace since the security establishment gained greater influence in the party last year. police are investigating two cases related to thang s tenure as chairman of state oil and gas firm petrovietnam that involved a loss of investment in local ocean bank and suspected wrongdoing at a petrovietnam subsidiary, petrovietnam construction joint stock corp (pvc) (pvx.hn), police said. thang was not available for comment. the corruption crackdown made global headlines in august when germany accused vietnam of kidnapping trinh xuan thanh, a former chairman of pvc, in berlin after he applied for asylum there. the party has said it aimed to let thanh go on trial next month. government critics have voiced suspicions that the corruption crackdown is politically motivated, at least in part, and aimed against those close to former prime minister nguyen tan dung, who lost out in an internal power struggle in 2016.  this development represents a major event in vietnamese politics and reflects a concerted effort by those in the commanding heights of the party to rein in and prosecute instances of large scale corruption and serious cases of malfeasance among high ranking party and state officials,  said vietnam expert jonathan london of leiden university. thang was dismissed from the politburo after the communist party found him responsible for financial losses at petrovietnam. it also stripped him of his role as party head of ho chi minh city to penalise him further.  prosecuting a former politburo member in the one party state is not unprecedented. in 1979, a former politburo official, hoang van hoan, was handed a death sentence in absentia after he had fled the country. on friday, police also issued an arrest order for nguyen quoc khanh, a former chairman of petrovietnam. in september, another former petrovietnam chairman was sentenced to death for embezzlement among other crimes. khanh was also temporarily dismissed from his current role at the trade ministry on friday, the ministry said in a statement.

" republican donald trump said on sunday the united states should consider more racial profiling, in response to a question about whether he supported greater law enforcement scrutiny of muslim americans after the orlando mass shooting. “i think profiling is something that we’re going to have to start thinking about as a country,” trump told cbs’ “face the nation.”  “you look at israel and you look at others, and they do it and they do it successfully. and you know, i hate the concept of profiling, but we have to start using common sense,” he said when asked if he supported increased profiling of muslims in america. trump made similar comments last december about profiling, the targeting of specific demographic groups for extra scrutiny, after a muslim american and his wife killed 14 people in san bernardino, california. last week, trump, the presumptive republican presidential nominee for the nov. 8 election, sparked criticism from many in his party for his comments on american muslims after the orlando attack on sunday, in which a u.s. born muslim man killed 49 people at a gay nightclub.  in a speech on national security on monday, trump stood by his call for a temporary ban on muslims entering the united states and proposed a suspension of immigration from countries with “a proven history of terrorism.”  he also said the muslim community had to “cooperate with law enforcement and turn in the people who they know are bad.”  hillary clinton, the presumptive democratic nominee, has said the comments show trump is unfit to be president. the florida gunman, omar mateen, was born in the united states to afghan parents. during a three hour siege at the club, he expressed support for islamic state, but officials believe he was “self radicalized.” in his interview on sunday, trump said there were “red flags” around mateen, who had been investigated twice by the fbi but ultimately cleared.  trump also reiterated his support for more scrutiny of mosques, saying that could resemble a controversial new york city surveillance program that has been shut down.  “if you go to france right now, they’re doing it in france. in fact, in some instances they’re closing down mosques,” he said. police in france closed some mosques shortly after gunmen aligned with islamic state militants killed 130 people in paris in a series of attacks on nov. 13. house of representatives speaker paul ryan endorsed trump but has said a muslim ban is not in u.s. interests. in excerpts of an nbc interview released on friday, ryan, the top elected u.s. republican, said republicans weighing whether to vote for trump should follow their “conscience.” trump brushed off the criticism on sunday and said he would put up his own money for his campaign if needed. “it would be nice if the republicans stuck together,” trump said in an abc interview. “i can win, one way or another.” ",0

" in the port city of baltimore, where europeans once streamed into america after crossing the atlantic by ship, a 47 year old immigrant named rhonda is in a desperate position. she said she wants to provide for her teenage daughter but cannot get a work permit because she is in the united states illegally. “i’d like, as a parent, to provide for my daughter’s needs. homelessness and moving around has been rough,” said rhonda, a native of trinidad and tobago who has lived in the united states since 2001 and spoke on condition that her last name not be used to protect her daughter. in houston, daniel castillo garcia said he is apprehensive about his toddler son’s future because the 19 year old mexican native is in deportation proceedings after being picked up by u.s. federal agents near the border. “i’m very worried for my son because i need to provide for him,” said garcia, who has lived in the united states since being brought into the country by his mother as a child in 2007. for these two and many others like them, perhaps their only realistic hope is that the u.s. supreme court revives president barack obama’s 2014 executive action on immigration, which was thrown out by a lower court. that plan was designed to let roughly 4 million people   those who have lived illegally in the united states at least since 2010, do not have a criminal record and have children who are u.s. citizens or lawful permanent residents   get into a program that shields them from deportation and supplies work permits. rhonda’s 16 year old daughter and garcia’s 2 year old son are citizens by virtue of being born in the united states. the court hears the case on monday and is due to rule by the end of june. rhonda said she cannot get a work permit because she overstayed her original 10 year visa. she and her daughter are staying in temporary housing provided by her church because she has no income. for a year, she was separated from her daughter, who plays the violin and hopes to attend college, because they could find nowhere to live together. rhonda, who said her christian faith keeps her positive, believes work authorization would make the difference because employers increasingly demand such documentation. “that’s why i’m in such hardship. i’m very anxious for something to happen,” she said. in baltimore’s heavily latino fell’s point neighborhood, south broadway is lined with store fronts advertising services in spanish, ranging from tax preparation to cellphone providers. catholic charities runs an immigrant resource center offering legal advice as well as education and health services. its managing attorney, adonia simpson, said about half the roughly 600 people she counsels annually have no option beyond obama’s program, known as deferred action for parents of americans and lawful permanent residents (dapa), if they want to legalize their status and get work permits. initial enthusiasm about obama’s plan waned when a federal judge put it on hold in february 2015, just before it was due to begin. all simpson can do for now is ask clients to gather documentation to be ready to apply. “the community is getting very discouraged,” simpson said. in maryland alone, about 56,000 people could be eligible for the dapa program, according to the migration policy institute think tank. obama’s plan was challenged by texas and 25 other states that argued he exceeded his authority in bypassing congress to take the actions. “the president has violated the constitution, and we are trying to prevent the president from implementing executive action that we believe is lawless,” republican texas attorney general ken paxton said. the supreme court is hearing the case at a time when immigration has become a hot issue in the u.s. presidential campaign, with top republican contenders calling for all illegal immigrants to be deported. an estimated 11 million immigrants are in the country illegally. in houston, garcia has pinned his hopes on the court reinstating obama’s program. “dapa will help me get that freedom and help me to keep going and have a good future for myself and my son,” garcia said in an interview translated from spanish by his attorney.

" donald trump may have done just enough in sunday’s presidential debate to keep his leaky presidential campaign afloat   and that may have put republicans considering abandoning him in an even tougher position.  had trump imploded, the flow of lawmakers and party luminaries who deserted him at the weekend over lewd comments he made about women on a videotape likely would have become a torrent, increasing demands for him to drop out of the race.  but that didn’t happen. now, republicans who have seen their party torn apart by trump’s candidacy are once again faced with a familiar dilemma: publicly abandon a badly wounded candidate who is endangering closely contested congressional races or stand behind him in the dimming hope that he can still win them the white house.  the manhattan real estate mogul delivered a feistier and more disciplined performance than at the first debate, hammering his democratic opponent hillary clinton on her use of a private email server while she was secretary of state, and again raising decades old accusations of sexual misconduct against her husband bill clinton.  that likely endeared him to the rowdy supporters who have packed arenas across the country for more than a year while perhaps doing little to reel in the more moderate voters in swing states that his campaign will need to defeat clinton in the nov. 8 election.  “his no holds barred approach to hillary tonight is what conservatives have wanted to see out of a candidate since bill clinton was in office,” said craig robinson, former political director of the iowa republican party. “the republican base and talk radio will love this performance.”  but the party is still hitched to a deeply flawed candidate who has especially struggled with women, college educated, and suburban voters. a recent reuters/ipsos poll showed close to 20 percent of americans were still undecided on which candidate to support. sixty percent of those were women.  a poll taken by cnn immediately following the debate showed republicans have reason to be anxious. viewers said clinton had beaten trump in the encounter, 57 percent to 34 percent.  the furor over the 2005 videotape, in which trump bragged about groping and trying to seduce women, led dozens of lawmakers to denounce him, including arizona senator john mccain. their condemnation plunged the party into its worst crisis since the resignation of president richard nixon, a republican, in 1974.  the house republican conference, a body comprised of the almost 250 republicans in the u.s. house of representatives, was set to meet on monday to discuss the foundering trump campaign, a house leadership aide said. house speaker paul ryan pointedly disinvited trump for a joint appearance in wisconsin that had been scheduled for saturday following publication of the tape.  all but six of the 40 republican officeholders whose races are considered competitive in the election have condemned trump’s comments in the video, although only three members of that group have called for him to drop out.  since the release of the video, the party’s governing body, the republican national committee, has offered no guidance to local party officials on how to handle questions about it.  “there hasn’t been one email or one phone call or anything as to what the guidance is from the rnc going forward,” said an rnc official who asked to remain unidentified.  the tape intensified talk in republican circles about diverting funds from trump to prop up house and senate candidates who might find themselves in newfound jeopardy because of the backlash.  “it’s well past time to cut all ties with trump and focus on preserving the republican congress and down ballot offices. immediately,” said john weaver, a veteran republican strategist.  republican officials have another worry: that trump’s unpopularity may lead many republican voters to stay at home on election day.  against this backdrop of panic and condemnation, trump on sunday sought to rally the party’s base with a fresh barrage of provocative attacks on clinton that will give the media something other than the tape to talk about.  he offered a blistering critique of her handling of foreign policy while the country’s chief diplomat and brought his rally cry for her to be jailed to the debate stage. he also carried out a threat to make an issue of her husband’s sexual history.  in doing so, trump may have stopped the bleeding, but he did nothing to stop the worrying.

" greenpeace africa and other ngos intend to appeal against south africa s decision to grant an environmental permit for a new 4,000 megawatt nuclear plant close to cape town, the activists said on monday. last month south africa s department of environmental affairs granted authorization to state owned power utility eskom to build the new plant at duynefontein, close to the continent s only existing nuclear site koeberg. south africa s nuclear regulator said in october that an installation site license for the plant would likely be granted in june, despite the finance minister saying construction of a new plant was unaffordable in a stagnant economy facing further credit downgrades.  if this project goes ahead, it will infringe the environmental rights of both present and future generations. this authorization can and must be challenged,  penny jane cooke, climate and energy campaigner for greenpeace africa, said in a statement. south africa s nuclear plans are shrouded in controversy and uncertainty, with local activists and the media raising concerns about transparency and costs as well as safety and environmental risks at a time when pretoria is trying to reduce the economy s heavy reliance on coal power. nuclear reactor makers including rosatom, south korea s kepco, france s edf and areva, toshiba owned westinghouse and china s cgn are eyeing the south african project, which could be worth tens of billions of dollars.

"shima, japan (reuters)   u.s. president barack obama said on thursday he expects the taliban to continue a strategy of violence following the appointment of a hardline leader, adding that the united states aims to uphold afghanistan’s fragile democratization and prevent its use as a base by islamic state.   “this continues to be an organization that sees violence as a strategy for obtaining its goals and moving its agenda forward in afghanistan,” said obama, told reporters during a group of seven summit at ise shima in central japan. “in the short term, we anticipate that the taliban will continue to pursue an agenda of violence and blowing up innocent people.”  “our goal right now is to make sure (afghanistan’s) constitution and democratic process is upheld (and) maintain the counter terrorism platforms that we need in the region so that al qaeda and now isil are not able to take root and use it as a base to attack us in the united states,” he said, using an acronym for islamic state. the selection of cleric mullah haibatullah akhundzada as the new taliban chief on wednesday all but dashes obama’s hopes for opening peace talks before he leaves office, one of his top foreign policy goals, current and former u.s. defense and intelligence officials said. akhundzada, a conservative islamic scholar from the taliban’s stronghold in southern afghanistan, succeeded mullah akhtar mansour four days after he was killed in a u.s. drone strike.  some u.s. officials had expressed hope that mansour’s death would eliminate an obstacle to peace negotiations between the taliban and the government of afghan president ashraf ghani.

" japan s emperor hirohito did not veto his advisers  decision to declare war on the united states in 1941 because he feared triggering an internal conflict that would destroy his country, he said in an account dictated to an adviser. set for auction in new york on wednesday, the handwritten document throws light on japan s role in world war two, as it records events dating from the 1920s, such as hirohito s resolve not to oppose future cabinet decisions, even if he disagreed.  he realized that if he wanted to be in power, he had to do what they wanted,  tom lamb, director of the books and manuscripts department at auction house bonhams, told reuters.  and that is an interesting fact, since, throughout the late 1930s and through the 1940s, military decisions were made, which he could not contest,  he said. the auctioneers have put an estimate of $100,000 to $150,000 on the manuscript, which consists of two browning twine bound notebooks written in pen and pencil by terasaki hidenari, an interpreter and adviser to the emperor, in 1946. the memoir concludes with the emperor s statement that if he had vetoed the decision to go to war, it would have resulted in a civil conflict that would have been even worse and  japan would have been destroyed,  the auction house said on its website. known in japanese as  dokuhakuroku , or  the emperor s monologue , the remarks may offer insight into the role the monarch played in the war campaign. this is a topic academics say has never been fully pursued in japan, largely due to u.s. occupation authorities  decision to retain the emperor as a symbol of a newly democratic nation.  the americans needed emperor hirohito to bind the country together, which he did,  lamb added.  the whole of japan changed from a rather military pre war style to a postwar economic powerhouse, and obviously the emperor was part of that.

" republican presidential candidate donald trump has pulled into an effective tie with democratic rival hillary clinton, erasing a substantial deficit as he consolidated support among his party’s likely voters in recent weeks, according to the latest reuters/ipsos national tracking poll released friday. the poll showed 40 percent of likely voters supporting trump and 39 percent backing clinton for the week of aug. 26 to sept. 1. clinton’s support has dropped steadily in the weekly tracking poll since aug. 25, eliminating what had been a eight point lead for her. trump’s gains came as republican support for their party’s candidate jumped by six percentage points over the past two weeks, to about 78 percent. that is still below the 85 percent support republican nominee mitt romney enjoyed in the summer of 2012, but the improvement helps explain trump’s rise in the poll. the reuters/ipsos poll is conducted online in english in all 50 states. the latest poll surveyed 1,804 likely voters over the course of the week; it had a credibility interval, a measure of accuracy, of three percent. different polls have produced widely different results over the course of the campaign. in part that’s because some, like reuters/ipsos, have attempted to measure the preferences of who’s likely to vote, while others have surveyed the larger pool of all registered voters. and even those that survey likely voters have different ways of estimating who is likely to cast a ballot.  polling aggregators, which calculate averages of major polls, have shown that clinton’s lead has been shrinking for the past few weeks. those averages put her advantage over trump at between three and six percentage points. some of the more recent individual polls, however, have the race even tighter. voters don’t elect the american president directly, of course, but through the electoral college, an assembly representing each of the 50 states and the district of columbia based on the number of legislators they have in congress. as of last friday, the separate reuters/ipsos states of the nation polling project estimated clinton was on track to win the electoral college, by about 332 votes to 206. those numbers were scheduled to be updated later friday. in recent weeks, clinton has come under renewed criticism over her handling of classified information while serving as u.s. secretary of state, and her family’s charitable foundation has come under fresh scrutiny for the donations it accepted while clinton served in the obama administration. meanwhile, clinton hasn’t been campaigning as actively as trump. trump, meanwhile, has reshuffled his campaign leadership and sought to broaden his appeal to moderate republicans and minorities. he recently suggested that he would be a better president than clinton for african americans, and has taken steps, including a meeting this week with mexican president enrique pena nieto, to reach out to immigrants. it remains to be seen whether those efforts will click. clinton has led trump through most of the campaign for the november election, though neither candidate appears to have inspired america.  in the latest reuters/ipsos poll, more than 20 percent of likely voters opted for a choice other than the two major nominees, whether an alternative candidate, “would not vote” or “unsure.” that figure is significantly higher than the 10 percent to 14 percent of respondents who answered similarly at this point in the 2012 campaign. both president barack obama and republican rival mitt romney enjoyed substantially stronger support at this point in the summer of 2012 than either trump or clinton does now. and while trump has consolidated his support among republicans, likely voters are expressing an increasingly sour view of clinton: the share of likely voters with an unfavorable view of the former secretary of state has grown to 57 percent, compared with trump’s 54 percent, her worst showing on that metric in a month. larry sabato, director of the university of virginia center for politics, said he remains convinced clinton is ahead, somewhere in the range seen among the polling aggregators. “there has been a closing that’s completely natural,” sabato said. “every four years, you have two national party conventions that produce a bounce of varying sizes. clinton got a substantial bounce this year that lasted for a full month. it’s usually gone around labor day, and by then we’ll be where we should be, which is right around four to five points” for clinton. in a separate question in the reuters/ipsos poll that included alternative party candidates, clinton and trump were tied at 39 percent. seven percent supported libertarian candidate gary johnson, and two percent supported jill stein of the green party.

"this is a truly disturbing discovery and an unimaginable threat that needs to be taken very seriously by our government mexican police discovered four men carting a kamikaze drone equipped with an ied and a remote detonator last week, in what analysts say is an example of cartels figuring out how to weaponizing uavs.the disturbing development is a manifestation of something top american security chiefs warned congress about earlier this year, when they said they feared terrorists would begin to use drones to attack targets within the u.s.drug cartels had already been turning to drones to smuggle their product into the u.s., and had begun using ieds in their turf struggles   but now at least cartel appears to have put the two technologies together, according to mexican reports analyzed by small wars journal. a weaponized drone/unmanned aerial vehicle (uav)/unmanned aerial system (uas) with a remotely detonated ied allows for a precision strike to take place against an intended target,  robert bunker and john p. sullivan, the authors of the new analysis, wrote.the drone-ied combination was found in central mexico, by federal police who did a traffic stop on a stolen pickup truck with four men in it.police found an ak-47, ammunition, phones and what the small wars journal authors said appears to be a 3dr solo quadcopter, which retails for about $250 online. taped to the drone was an ied, which could be trigger by remote detonator.mr. bunker and mr. sullivan said the  dron bomba,  as they labeled it, was the next step for cartels that have been using papas bombas, or potato bombs   a roughly shaped sphere with a core of explosives and nails and other shrapnel packed inside for the most lethal reach.the analysts said several examples of potato bombs have been detected in mexico this year.in august, u.s. border patrol agents nabbed a $5,000 drone and seized a $46,000 meth load in southern california, after one agent detected it flying overhead. agents also apprehended the man assigned to pick up the load, who said he had made a number of such pickups and was paid $1,000 each time.meanwhile, the chiefs of the fbi and national counterterrorism center told congress last month that they are worried islamic state terrorists who have pioneered weaponized drones in the middle east will use the tactic inside the u.s. to spread a toxin or drop a grenade.  washington times",1

" the u.s. senate foreign relations committee will meet with secretary of state rex tillerson to discuss the administration’s proposed budget, the panel’s chairman said on wednesday, after heated opposition in congress to president donald trump’s plan to slash funding for diplomacy and foreign aid. “i’ve let secretary tillerson know there’s a lot of concern about the budget issue,” senator bob corker, the committee’s republican chairman, said at a hearing on the global humanitarian crisis. members of the senate panel will have lunch with tillerson at the state department on thursday, he said. corker also made clear that when congress takes up agriculture related legislation next year he would push to reform current rules for distributing u.s. food aid, which make it more expensive and time consuming to provide assistance after international crises. “we could feed 4 to 6 million more people each year,” he said, saying some interest groups pushing to keep current rules are “extorting us.” yves daccord, director general of the international committee of the red cross (icrc) said the humanitarian crisis in yemen, south sudan, northeastern nigeria and somalia, plus ethiopia and kenya, may be among the worst in recent history. “we’re talking about 20 million directly affected, plus ... several other dozen millions possibly affected,” daccord told the hearing. the icrc said on wednesday the world has just a few months to save millions in yemen and somalia from starvation, as war and drought ruin crops and block deliveries of food and medical care. many of trump’s fellow republicans, as well as democrats, objected to his first budget outline last week, which boosted military spending and cut international programs by 28 percent. they said humanitarian assistance and diplomacy are at least as important to security as weapons. “it’s essential that we maintain our international affairs budget, from this senator’s perspective,” republican senator todd young told the hearing.  the budget as presented by trump is unlikely to pass. congress, not the white house, determines government spending.  corker told reporters on tuesday that he supported efforts to make state department programs more efficient, but wanted a more thorough review of various programs. “i think every department of government should be looked at continuously, and so i’m all for us looking into that,” corker said. “but i would like to walk through some of the areas that he (tillerson) feels he wants to stress and obviously congress ultimately will have the say (on the budget).” ",0
" the premiers of two regions where the far right alternative for germany (afd) party made big gains in sunday s national election warned that chancellor angela merkel s conservatives must change course to stop the former east germany s rightward drift. merkel s christian democrats (cdu) suffered big losses across much of germany in the election, in which the afd, with its anti immigration message, became the first far right party in the national parliament in over half a century. the calls for a rightward shift add to the challenge merkel faces as she tries to assemble an already tricky three party coalition including the left wing greens, the pro business free democrats (fdp) and her own increasingly fractious party. prospects for a three way pact nonetheless improved on saturday when the greens voted at a special congress to start exploratory talks on a deal despite reservations about the other parties  harder line immigration policies. the afd s surge prompted soul searching within the conservative camp, with many blaming merkel s 2015 decision to open the doors to over a million migrants fleeing war and poverty in the middle east and africa for the far right s surge. the conservative premiers of saxony, where the afd topped polls, and of saxony anhalt called for the cdu to move to the right to stem the losses.  people want germany to stay germany,  said stanislaw tillich, premier of saxony, in an interview with the funke newspaper network.  they don t want parallel societies and rising criminality.  rainer haseloff, premier of saxony anhalt, echoed this, telling newspaper die welt:  people want to know how germany will preserve its identity.  these calls align the two influential state leaders more closely with the cdu s bavarian sister party, the christian social union (csu), which wants a hard immigration ceiling. while both premiers stuck to merkel s line that a firm upper limit would be impractical, their calls for the state to take a firmer hand with immigrants could strengthen the csu s hand as the sister parties attempt to thrash out a common position ahead of coalition talks with the fdp and greens. some warn that a black (cdu) yellow (fdp) green  jamaica coalition , risks heightening a sense of alienation among voters in the former east germany. given the losses all three parties had suffered in the east,  a jamaica coalition would be seen as a west german coalition in the east,  green mp canan bayram said. but merkel, in a podcast released on saturday, warned against treating germany s poorer east as a homogenous bloc.  we see these fears of globalisation, of anonymity, about old age care everywhere, including in the west,  she said.  we have to get people listening, to win people over by solving their problems. that s my task.

" more than a dozen state prosecutors urged president donald trump in a letter on tuesday not to withdraw from the paris climate agreement, which commits the united states, along with 200 other countries, to reducing its greenhouse gas emissions in an attempt to slow global warming.  with the letter, attorneys general from 12 states as well as the district of columbia and american samoa have joined a chorus of voices, including major fossil fuel energy companies as well as environmental advocates, condemning the idea of exiting the agreement, which the republican president has criticized in the past.  “climate change, if left unchecked, will lead to global environmental dislocation and disaster on a scale we likely cannot imagine,” the prosecutors wrote, urging the president to “maintain and reconfirm the united states’ commitment to this groundbreaking agreement.” the paris accord, reached by nearly 200 countries in 2015, seeks to limit global warming by slashing carbon dioxide and other emissions from burning fossil fuels. as part of the deal, the united states committed to reducing its emissions by between 26 percent and 28 percent below 2005 levels by 2025. in an april 14 appearance on television show “fox & friends,” scott pruitt, a former attorney general for oklahoma whom trump appointed to head the u.s. environmental protection agency, called for an “exit” from the paris accord while energy secretary rick perry, speaking at the bloomberg new energy finance conference in new york on tuesday, said washington should “renegotiate it.”  pruitt and perry were among the administration officials scheduled to meet last week to discuss the u.s. position on the accord, but the meeting was canceled. sources told reuters on april 5 a group of coal producers told white house officials that remaining in the global deal to combat climate change would give u.s. negotiators a chance to advocate for coal in the future of the global energy mix. tuesday’s letter was signed by top prosecutors from connecticut, delaware, iowa, maine, maryland, massachusetts, minnesota, new york, north carolina, oregon, rhode island and vermont.

" eugene kaspersky, the ceo of the russian cybersecurity software firm that bears his name, had a big american dream.  he wanted his company to go beyond selling anti virus software to consumers and small businesses and become a major vendor to the u.s. government   one of the world’s biggest buyers of cybersecurity tools.  kaspersky set up a u.s. subsidiary, kgss, in arlington, virginia that would be focused on winning that business. he sponsored flashy conferences with high profile speakers  including michael flynn, who was briefly president donald trump’s national security adviser   sought to join u.s. trade groups and even underwrote programming on national public radio.  all of this was done to burnish kaspersky’s image and help it become an accepted vendor for the u.s. government despite its russian roots, according to people familiar with the strategy.  but eugene kaspersky was never able to overcome lingering suspicions among u.s. intelligence officials that he and his company were, or could become, pawns of russia's spy agencies. kaspersky ""has never helped, nor will help, any government in the world with its cyberespionage efforts,"" the company said.  kaspersky’s american ambitions were further eroded by the sharp deterioration in u.s. russia relations following russia’s invasion of crimea in 2014, and later when u.s. intelligence agencies concluded that russia had hacked the 2016 u.s. presidential election.  testifying before the u.s. congress in may, u.s. intelligence chiefs for the first time publicly expressed doubt that kaspersky products could be trusted.  fbi agents last month interviewed kaspersky employees, asking whether they reported to russia based executives and how much data from american customers could be seen by russian employees, according to three current and former employees. the fbi declined to comment on thursday.  on tuesday, the u.s. general services administration, the government agency that manages the federal bureaucracy, removed kaspersky from a list of approved vendors, saying gsa’s mission was to ensure the security of u.s. government systems.  there is also a bill before congress that would explicitly bar the defense department from using any kaspersky products.  kaspersky says his company is being targeted for political reasons.  “these reckless actions negatively impact global cybersecurity by limiting competition, slowing down technology innovations and ruining the industry and law enforcement agency cooperation required to catch the bad guys,” he said in a statement to reuters.   the arlington offices of kgss were empty when a reuters reporter visited them on thursday. a kaspersky spokeswoman said most of the staff, which number less than 10, often work from home.  the u.s. clampdown comes even though officials have offered no public evidence to suggest the company has done anything untoward or that the russian government is using its software to launch cyber attacks.  two former employees and a person briefed on the fbi case told reuters that kaspersky software has at times inappropriately inspected and removed files from users’ machines in its hunt for alleged cyber criminals, even when those files were not corrupted by viruses.  “kaspersky lab believes it is completely unacceptable that the company is being unjustly accused without any hard evidence to back up these false allegations,” the kaspersky spokeswoman said in response in an email.  it is extremely rare for a company to be singled out for federal buying restrictions in the absence of clear evidence of wrongdoing.  “this sets a really dangerous precedent” where other nations could make similar, unsubstantiated claims against u.s. vendors, said robert m. lee, a former cyberwarfare operative for u.s. intelligence and now ceo of cybersecurity startup dragos.  the russian government has denounced the kaspersky crackdown and said it does not rule out retaliatory measures. officials at u.s. tech companies with significant operations in russia say they fear they could become targets.  federal contracting databases reviewed by reuters show only a few hundred thousand dollars in purchases from kaspersky, and an employee confirmed the company’s federal government revenue was “miniscule.”  but kaspersky also sells to federal contractors and third party software companies that incorporate its technology in their products, so its technology may be more widely used in government than it appears from the contracting databases, u.s. officials say.  founded in 1997, kaspersky grew rapidly through the 2000s to become one of the world's leading anti virus software companies. (kaspersky's global reach: tmsnrt.rs/2uwtqov)  but the company was dogged from the start by suspicions about its ties to russia’s federal security service (fsb), the main successor to the kgb. eugene kaspersky attended a kgb school and the company has acknowledged doing work for the fsb.  as the company grew, kaspersky was determined to overcome those fears.  “we have to be more american than americans,” kaspersky told reuters in 2013, when a u.s. goodwill offensive began.  a cornerstone of the effort was a series of kgss hosted conferences in washington where prominent u.s. officials including flynn, a former defense intelligence agency director, former cia and nsa director michael hayden and house of representatives homeland security committee chairman michael mccaul discussed cybersecurity issues.  the company privately courted u.s. intelligence and law enforcement officials by sending experts to brief them on nation state hacking campaigns uncovered by the firm, according to people present at those meetings.  “they came to us and said, ‘we want to change our image, we know people don’t trust us’,” said one former senior obama administration official who took part in some of those meetings.  but the suspicions never subsided. when the company sought to join one washington based technology trade organization, it was “politely told it couldn’t happen,” according to an industry source with direct knowledge of the matter.  the source said industry group officials had an inside joke: “kaspersky (membership) is like having the kremlin join.”  not coincidentally, kaspersky’s government sales effort never gained traction. in an email to reuters, the company noted “complexities associated with doing business with north america’s government sector.”  privately held kaspersky said its u.s. revenue, most of which comes from selling anti virus software to consumers and small businesses, slipped from $164 million in 2014 to about $156 million in 2016.  some u.s. national security experts say kaspersky is being treated unfairly. lee said he has long been bothered by the “public shaming” of kaspersky by people who make allegations without presenting evidence.  the u.s. government has the right to choose not to use kaspersky products for any reason, he said, but “the way they are doing it” is wrong.  “i don’t believe in geographic restrictions that say, ‘because kaspersky is a russian based company, therefore it is bad,’” said former white house cybersecurity policy coordinator michael daniel. “you would want your decision to be based on actual corporate bad behavior.”  ",0
" brexit campaigner nigel farage is a “person of interest” in the u.s. investigation into possible collusion between russia and donald trump’s presidential campaign, the guardian reported on thursday citing unidentified sources. the london based newspaper said farage had not been accused of wrongdoing and was not a suspect or target of the u.s. investigation. but it said he was “right in the middle” of the relationships being looked at.  the newspaper said the former leader of the uk independence party had “raised the interest” of fbi investigators due to his connections with trump and julian assange’s wikileaks, which published leaked emails from the democratic national committee during the campaign. an fbi spokeswoman declined to comment on the guardian story, and other u.s. officials said they were unaware of any serious fbi interest in farage.  farage said on twitter it had taken him a long time to read the guardian article because he was “laughing so much at this fake news”. “this hysterical attempt to associate me with the (vladimir) putin regime is a result of the liberal elite being unable to accept brexit and trump,” he said. “i consider it extremely doubtful that i could be a person of interest to the fbi as i have no connections to russia.” accusations that russia interfered in the u.s. 2016 presidential election have dogged trump since he entered office and a former fbi chief, robert mueller, has been named as special counsel to investigate any collusion. u.s. intelligence agencies concluded that russia used computer hacking, propaganda and misleading news reports designed to sway political opinion in an attempt to boost trump’s chances of winning the white house. trump has dismissed the notion that russia played any role in his november election victory. kremlin chief vladimir putin, a former kgb spy, has denied meddling in the u.s. election.  cia director mike pompeo called assange’s wikileaks a “hostile intelligence service” in april after it distributed material hacked from democratic national committee computers during the 2016 campaign.  pompeo said russia’s gru military intelligence service had used wikileaks to distribute the material and concluded that russia stole the emails and took other actions to tilt the election in favor of trump, a republican, over democratic candidate hillary clinton. “one of the things the intelligence investigators have been looking at is points of contact and persons involved,” the guardian quoted one source as saying. “if you triangulate russia, wikileaks, assange and trump associates the person who comes up with the most hits is nigel farage.” “he’s right in the middle of these relationships. he turns up over and over again. there’s a lot of attention being paid to him.” farage, who campaigned for decades for britain to leave the european union, was a vocal backer of trump, appearing on the campaign trail and meeting him in new york just days after the election victory.  farage, who also attended trump’s inauguration in washington, met assange in march this year at the ecuadorean embassy in london where the wikileaks founder has been holed up for five years.

" myanmar s government said on wednesday that police had arrested two reuters journalists, wa lone and kyaw soe oo. the reporters had been working on stories about a military crackdown on the rohingya muslim minority in rahkine state that has caused almost 650,000 people to flee to neighboring bangladesh. the ministry of information said in a statement on its facebook page that the journalists and two policemen face charges under the british colonial era official secrets act. the 1923 law carries a maximum prison sentence of 14 years. the reporters  illegally acquired information with the intention to share it with foreign media,  said the statement, which was accompanied by a photo of the pair in handcuffs.  it said they were detained at a police station on the outskirts of yangon, the southeast asian nation s main city. wa lone and kyaw soe oo went missing on tuesday evening after they had been invited to meet police officials over dinner. reuters  driver myothant tun dropped them off at battalion 8 s compound at around 8 pm and the two reporters and two police officers headed to a nearby restaurant. the journalists did not  return to the car. the rohingya refugees in bangladesh say their exodus from the mainly buddhist nation was triggered by a military counter offensive in rakhine state that the united nations has branded  a textbook example of ethnic cleansing .  reuters reporters wa lone and kyaw soe oo have been reporting on events of global importance in myanmar, and we learned today that they have been arrested in connection with their work,  said stephen j. adler, president and editor in chief of reuters.  we are outraged by this blatant attack on press freedom.  we call for authorities to release them immediately,  he said. a spokesman for myanmar leader aung san suu kyi confirmed that the two journalists had been arrested.  not only your reporters, but also the policemen who were involved in that case,  spokesman zaw htay said.  we will take action against those policemen and also the reporters.  in washington, state department spokeswoman heather nauert emphasized that the agency was  following this closely.  she said that u.s. ambassador scot marciel on wednesday had a conversation with two government officials in myanmar who seemed  genuinely unaware  of the situation.   we care about the safety and security of international reporters who are simply just trying to do their jobs. so we re going to continue to try to stay on that,  nauert said.  the u.s. embassy in yangon said in a statement posted on its website on wednesday it was  deeply concerned by the highly irregular arrests of two reuters reporters after they were invited to meet with police officials in yangon last night .  for a democracy to succeed, journalists need to be able to do their jobs freely,  the embassy said.  we urge the government to explain these arrests and allow immediate access to the journalists.   the european union s mission in yangon also voiced concern.  the eu delegation is closely following their case and we call on the myanmar authorities to ensure the full protection of their rights,  it said in a statement.  media freedom is the foundation of any democracy.  the new york based committee to protect journalists called for the reporters  immediate and unconditional release.  these arrests come amid a widening crackdown which is having a grave impact on the ability of journalists to cover a story of vital global importance,  said shawn crispin, cpj s senior southeast asia representative. wa lone, who joined reuters in july 2016, has covered a range of stories, including the flight of rohingya refugees from rakhine in 2016 and, in much larger numbers, this year. he has written about military land grabs and the killing of ruling party lawyer ko ni in january. this year he jointly won an honorable mention from the society of publishers in asia for reuters coverage of the rakhine crisis in 2016.  he previously worked for the myanmar times, where he covered myanmar s historic 2015 elections, and people s age, a local weekly newspaper, where his editor was myanmar s current minister of information pe myint. kyaw soe oo, an ethnic rakhine buddhist from state capital sittwe, has worked with reuters since september. he has covered the impact of the aug. 25 attacks on police and army posts in the northern rakhine, and reported from the central part of the state where local buddhists have been  enforcing segregation between rohingya and rakhine communities. he previously worked for root investigation agency, a local news outlet focused on rakhine issues.  i have been arrest  were the four words that wa lone texted to reuters myanmar bureau chief antoni slodkowski on tuesday evening to let him know what was happening. very soon after that wa lone s phone appeared to have been switched off. over the next 24 hours, reuters colleagues in yangon filed a missing persons report, went to three police stations, and asked a series of government officials what had happened to the two reporters. they got no official information until wednesday evening.

" argentina blocked two european activists from entering the country on the eve of the world trade organization s ministerial meeting in buenos aires, the two told a local radio program on saturday. sally burch, a british activist and journalist for the latin american information agency, said argentina had already revoked credentials given to her by the wto to attend the meeting but thought she would be able to enter the country as a tourist.  they found my name on a list and started asking questions ... supposedly i was a false tourist,  burch said on radio 10.  it s not very democratic of argentina s government.  petter titland, the spokesman for the norweigan ngo attac norge, said authorities denied him entry without explaining why. late last month, argentina rescinded the credentials of some 60 activists who had been accredited by the wto to attend the meeting because it determined they would be  more disruptive than constructive.  wto meetings often attract protests by anti globalization groups, but they have remained largely peaceful since riots broke out at the 1999 meeting in seattle. wto s spokesman, keith rockwell, reiterated on saturday that it disagreed with argentina s decision to revoke activists  credentials.  we didn t have the same perspective but we re now moving on,  rockwell told journalists. argentina s president mauricio macri has promoted business friendly policies since taking office in december 2015, and argentina will host global events as chair of the g20 group of major economies next year.

" less than a year before a presidential election, mexico s politicians are fearful they could be punished by voters for any misstep in responding to two major earthquakes that killed more than 300 people this month. with tolerance low after years of violence and corruption, the tremors could further undermine voters  confidence in the ruling party of president enrique pena nieto and the entire political class.  we re clearly aware that this is a test we cannot flunk,  said senator miguel angel chico of the ruling institutional revolutionary party, or pri. pena nieto sprang into action this month after an 8.1 magnitude earthquake on sept. 7, the strongest in nearly a century, leveled parts of southern mexico and killed at least 98 people.  on tuesday, when a 7.1 tremor struck, he aborted a trip to the first quake s disaster zone to return to mexico city, where 38 buildings collapsed killing scores of people, including more than 20 children at a school.  pena nieto went to the school as rescuers searched for children and adults trapped inside.  the death toll from tuesday s quake, which struck the capital and nearby states on the anniversary of a devastating 1985 tremor, has reached 230. politicians from all sides called for solidarity and praised how mexicans, many of whom volunteered to help climb through rubble and search for survivors, had come together. nonetheless, one figure loomed large over the fallout from the quakes and any instability it may generate ahead of the july vote: leftist andres manuel lopez obrador, long the bete noire of mexico s political establishment and the frontrunner in many polls. lopez obrador, or amlo as he is known, enjoys widespread support in the left leaning capital, home to about 20 million people. the former mexico city mayor, who narrowly lost the two previous presidential elections, won praise from supporters after the first quake when he proposed donating 20 percent of his party s federal campaign funds for victims. on wednesday, volunteers across mexico flocked to help remove debris and donate supplies in a grass roots effort that opposition national action party (pan) senator daniel avila said was symptomatic of widespread distrust of the political class and the government s ability to deliver.   i think voters could look to punish those currently in government if they don t manage this situation well,  avila said.  the pri, which ran mexico for an uninterrupted 71 years and currently places third in the polls, knows the political damage that earthquakes can inflict. pri president miguel de la madrid led the country during a powerful 1985 quake, which killed thousands in mexico city  exactly 32 years to the day before tuesday s tremor.  de la madrid was widely criticized for his response, worsening already broad discontent with the party s corrupt, authoritarian rule at the time. after the quake, the pri gradually lost support and was voted out in 2000.  now, party supporters hope that a swift response nationwide can avoid a repeat of that loss. governors from the pri and its coalition partner the green party are in office in oaxaca and chiapas, the states hardest hit by the first quake this month. and the pri narrowly won a recent gubernatorial race in the state of mexico, a longstanding party bastion where at least 12 people had died by wednesday. there have been accusations that aid has disproportionately benefited wealthier areas. in the capital, fashionable districts like roma and condesa received most of the organized assistance. with a glut of people arriving to help and little guidance on how to best use resources, volunteers struggled, said 34 year old art professor camila morales, adding that in poorer districts there had been insufficient help.   on the outskirts in the south of the city ... there is no help arriving, they still don t even have power,  said morales, who was part of a large volunteer group from a local university.  on social media, a campaign emerged to prevent politicians from capitalizing on the earthquake. following lopez obrador s lead, one petition sought to get the federal government to divert electoral funds for political parties to helping victims. quickly, other politicians jumped on board.     enrique ochoa, the pri chairman and one of the leftist s fiercest critics, on wednesday tweeted:  i ask that the parties get together to resolve ... how we can donate campaign money, without pretense or opportunism.

" robert michel, a gentlemanly midwesterner who championed civility in washington as house republican leader but left congress dismayed by the rise of conservative firebrands in his own party, died on friday at age 93, a former aide said. michel died at the virginia hospital center in arlington, virginia, where he had been admitted in the last few weeks with pneumonia, said michael johnson, a former chief of staff to the congressman. michel, a decorated world war two veteran who was wounded in the battle of the bulge, was first elected in 1956 to the u.s. house of representatives from illinois and served for 38 years. his time in the house came during a four decade era of democratic control, but as minority leader starting in 1981 michel helped shepherd the policies of republican presidents ronald reagan and george h.w. bush through congress. in a statement, bush called michel “a great american for whom the words ‘duty’ and ‘honor’ and ‘country’ weren’t just a campaign slogan, but a lifelong creed.”  the courtly michel (pronounced “michael”), known as bob, amassed a conservative voting record but believed in bipartisanship and maintained friendships with many democratic colleagues, including house speakers tip o’neill and tom foley. “it has always puzzled me that in washington we have no public vocabulary to describe civility, which i believe is among the highest public virtues,” michel said in 1991.  “raising the level of your voice doesn’t raise the level of discussion. listening with care is better than talking in sound bites and thinking in slogans. ... peaks of uncommon progress can be reached by paths of common courtesy.” michel served as house republican leader for 14 years until deciding not to seek re election to the house in the november 1994 elections. with the rise of conservative rabble rousers like georgia’s newt gingrich in the house republican caucus in the late 1980s and early 1990s, michel’s brand of leadership   consultation with democrats instead of confrontation   was becoming obsolete. after gingrich signaled he might try to depose him as republican leader, michel expressed confidence that he would have won but said such a fight would have been “fratricidal.” gingrich and his allies sought to portray the democratic leaders of the house as corrupt legislative dictators. in may 1993, michel warned that the “politics of anger” was slowly destroying the united states’ civic environment. michel announced in october 1993 he would retire from the house after the 1994 election. michel lamented that congress was becoming a place lacking camaraderie and deplored colleagues who resorted to “trashing the institution” for political gain. gingrich helped engineer a republican takeover of the house in the 1994 elections and rose to the job of speaker. his  ascendancy and michel’s retirement ushered in a new combative style of leadership for house republicans, who have remained largely uncompromising ever since. michel served in the house under five republican and four democratic presidents. the last of them, democrat bill clinton, honored him with the presidential medal of freedom, the highest u.s. civilian award. “in the best sense he is a gentleman legislator who, in spite of the great swings in public opinion from year to year, has remained always true to the midwestern values he represents so faithfully in the house,” clinton said during the august 1994 ceremony. michel was born in 1923 in peoria, illinois, long viewed as a symbol of small town america, and grew up in the great depression. he served as an infantryman in europe during world war two and earned two bronze stars, the purple heart and four battle stars. after graduating from bradley university in peoria, michel worked in a congressional office until winning his house seat in 1956. he married his wife corinne in 1948 and the couple had four children. she died in 2003.

" the kremlin on thursday condemned a pre election video in the united states promoting republican front runner donald trump at hillary clinton’s expense, complaining that it unfairly “demonized” russia. the kremlin did not spell out what its exact objection to the political attack video was. but its portrayal of president vladimir putin as one of washington’s toughest opponents alongside islamic state, a group the kremlin says it is fighting in syria, is likely to have stirred anger among officials.   “i saw this clip. i do not know for sure if vladimir putin saw it. (but) our attitude is negative,” kremlin spokesman dmitry peskov told a teleconference with reporters. the video tries to cast doubt over the ability of clinton, the democratic party’s likely presidential candidate, to contend with putin in the event of her winning the november election. presenting what it suggests are the united states’ toughest opponents, it shows putin throwing an opponent in a judo bout before cutting to footage of mohammed emwazi, the late islamic state executioner nicknamed “jihadi john”.    it then shifts to a clip of clinton which has been edited to make it appear as if she is barking like a dog. putin is then shown laughing. “it’s an open secret for us that demonizing russia and whatever is linked to russia is unfortunately a mandatory hallmark of america’s election campaign,” said peskov. “we always sincerely regret this and wish the (u.s.) electoral process were conducted without such references to our country.” until now, the kremlin has largely held off criticising trump. putin and trump have lavished praise on one another in the past after the republican front runner spoke out in favour of building bridges with the kremlin and of working together to fight terrorism. russian state tv, which usually closely reflects the kremlin’s world view, has also generally been more positive about trump than the other presidential candidates, suggesting his policies are more russia friendly. but state tv has at the same time complained about what it says is the anti russian tenor of the overall campaign, criticising most candidates for what it has described as their hysterical cold war style statements on russia. the united states has accused russia during its aerial bombing campaign in syria of not targeting islamic state targets with the same ferocity or frequency it has demonstrated against what washington says are more moderate groups opposed to president bashar al assad.   moscow, an ally of assad, has denied that charge, declaring islamic state a dangerous threat to its own national security.

" new jersey governor chris christie’s administration sued cash strapped gambling hub atlantic city on monday, seeking to freeze city spending until it remits the millions of dollars it owes to its school district. in the civil action, state education commissioner david hespe said atlantic city owed the district $82 million of tax revenues collected for the school year. the city already paid $48 million of that, but must still remit the remaining $34 million by july 15, court documents showed. that might be impossible. as of april 1, the city had only $8 million of cash available for operations. second quarter tax collections that begin in may will not provide enough to fund required disbursements, the lawsuit said. christie is seeking to stop the city from making its $3.2 million payroll on friday, he said in a televised press conference. the state sued “to protect the property tax collections that rightfully belong to the atlantic city school district and the children and families they serve,” christie said. in new jersey, cities must act as collection agents by collecting property taxes on behalf of school districts and  transmitting the money to them.  the lawsuit is the latest in christie’s high stakes game of chicken against city officials and some lawmakers over whether to take over the city’s operations to avoid bankruptcy. christie and state senate leaders say city officials have not done enough to stop the bleeding. they supported a legislative package that links a full state takeover with one that would provide immediate revenue for the city. the nearly insolvent city has been under state oversight since 2011. mayor don guardian threatened to close city hall for three weeks beginning on friday afternoon because it will not have enough money to pay workers after that. christie twice vetoed   even after winning changes he sought   legislation aimed at stabilizing the city’s tax base by letting casinos make fixed payments in lieu of property taxes. the city’s state approved budget relied on those revenues. in february, christie pinned that legislation to the takeover measure, which guardian initially supported but later called a “fascist dictatorship.” the package is now stalled in the state assembly, where speaker vincent prieto has refused to bring it to a vote because he says its goal is to dismantle collective bargaining agreements.  on monday, moody’s investors service downgraded the city deeper into junk territory, to caa3.

" the u.s. environmental protection agency announced on tuesday it will bar certain scientists from serving on its independent advisory boards, a move critics say could open the way to more industry friendly advisors on the panels. the epa barred scientists who have won agency awarded grants in the past, billing the step as a way to preserve the independence and diversity of the boards, which provide the scientific input for agency decisions around pollution and climate change regulation. “whatever science comes out of epa, (it) shouldn’t be political science,” epa administrator scott pruitt, said in a release, adding that committee members will be “financially independent” from the agency.  senator tom carper, the top democrat on the senate environment committee, said pruitt’s decision was part of an epa effort to “delegitimize the work of nonpartisan scientists.” carper added, “this crusade endangers the health of every american, and it cannot be tolerated.” pruitt signaled the move during a speech last week at the conservative heritage foundation, when he questioned the independence of scientists who have won past epa research grants, and promised to “fix” the situation. during his election campaign last year, republican president donald trump promised to roll back environmental regulations from democratic president barack obama’s administration, including those limiting carbon dioxide emissions blamed for global warming, to make government more friendly to the drilling, mining, and manufacturing businesses.     the advisory boards were created by congress to serve as a check on epa policies and research. they include the epa scientific advisory board, the clean air scientific advisory committee, and the board of scientific counselors.  last year, the sab questioned an epa report that concluded that hydraulic fracturing   an oil and gas drilling technology that frees petroleum from underground shale formations   had no ""widespread impacts"" on drinking water despite evidence of problems in several states. (reut.rs/2h2gtrd) in june, pruitt decided not to renew the terms of nine members of a separate body, the 18 member board of scientific counselors. one of those members, michigan state university professor of community sustainability robert richardson, told reuters the move came as a surprise because the work they were doing was “apolitical.”     the epa is also expected to announce three new members of the clean air advisory committee on tuesday. pruitt is an outspoken doubter of mainstream climate science, a consensus of scientists that carbon dioxide from human use of fossil fuels is a primary driver of global warming, triggering more frequent volatile storms, sea level rise, and droughts.  pruitt has said he wants to set up a televised debate about the science of climate change between scientists who believe it is driven by humans and those that do not.

" the race between hillary clinton and bernie sanders for the u.s. democratic presidential nomination   once a civil affair   has taken a sour turn, with mud slinging from both camps over the former secretary of state’s win in the nevada caucuses.  sanders’ supporters are alleging that foul play by casino managers helped clinton out in saturday’s contest, while clinton’s camp has blasted   in at times vulgar terms   the vermont senator’s assertion he took the state’s latino vote. the tensions reflect the tight battle between the two heading into next saturday’s south carolina primary. sanders, who had surged in recent months to challenge front runner clinton, is trying to maintain momentum against her in a part of the united states where she wields an advantage among minority voters.     the angrier tone also marks a turn from what has been a mostly civil race on the democratic side, in contrast with the noisy insult hurling that has characterized much of the republican race. . while sanders and the former first lady have publicly clashed on their approaches to healthcare and regulating wall street, they have frequently emphasized their common ground on social issues. sanders has also refused so far to join in republican attacks on clinton’s record as secretary of state. “let’s talk about the real issues facing america,” he said during one televised debate. the tone soured after nevada. officials with national nurses united, which endorsed sanders, have said there were irregularities at casino caucus sites   such as casino managers wearing clinton paraphernalia   which they said amounted to intimidation of casino employee voters. “from what nurses observed in nevada sanders campaign should call for un observers to protect democracy,” the union said in one twitter post on sunday. neither clinton nor sanders’ campaigns immediately responded to requests for comment on the allegations. meanwhile, both campaigns have argued about what the polling from the nevada caucuses show. one set of entrance and exit poll results conducted by cbs news showed sanders took 53 percent of latino votes in the state. this is a critical group for sanders as he seeks to broaden his support base after his early results   a very narrow loss and a decisive win   in iowa and new hampshire, which have overwhelmingly white voter populations. “i don’t typically like to swear on twitter, but by all accounts so far this is complete and utter bullshit,” clinton spokesman nick merrill wrote on twitter, referring to a sanders’ campaign press release asserting he took the latino bloc in nevada. clinton has been expected to find easier territory as  contests move into the south in the state by state battles to pick a party presidential nominee for the november general election. her backers say minority voters are her “firewall” against sanders’ popularity among young voters who dislike establishment politics and are attracted by his vows to take on wall street excesses and high college fees. she won nevada, which is nearly a quarter latino, by just over 5 points. sanders’ camp, meanwhile, has disputed clinton camp assertions that she drew the lion’s share of the union votes in the nevada contest, accusing her campaign of inventing figures.  “they do have a tendency to make stuff up,” sanders’ spokesman michael briggs said in an email. the american federation of teachers issued a press release on monday listing 23 unions that back clinton.

" twenty four hours after spain removed him from power, catalonia s leader had resolved to leave the country and take his independence campaign to the heart of the european union, but first he needed to tie off an important loose end. carles puigdemont s secessionist alliance was threatening to unravel, with the region s biggest grass roots independence organization unhappy about his plan. so he called a meeting of political allies on the eve of his departure for brussels, according to three sources with first hand knowledge of the events. in the rural hamlet of vilahur, near puigdemont s home town, he and seven others, including the deputy chief of the grass roots catalan national assembly (anc), met over dinner at a farmhouse in the expectation puigdemont and others present would be arrested for rebellion within hours, one source said. puigdemont told the group he was not running away from a fight, as anc officials feared it would be perceived, and that he would use brussels, home to the eu parliament and commission, as a stage to continue to speak out against spain s crackdown on the independence movement, the source added. after adjourning for the night, the group resumed the next morning at the farmhouse and agreed to back his plan. crucially, that plan also included a commitment to contest snap regional elections called by madrid for dec. 21 rather than boycott them as the anc first envisaged.   on reaching agreement, puigdemont told them he was prepared to  spend 30 years in prison  for the cause and the others embraced him in what the source described as an emotional farewell. anc deputy leader agusti alcoberro was among them.   the account of the meeting reveals how the independence movement s leadership managed to overcome deep rooted internal divisions and agree a rough game plan for the weeks ahead. while the two main pro independence parties finally chose on tuesday to contest the elections under their own brand rather than a joint ticket, their manifestos will be coordinated and they are still expected to join forces after the vote.   an opinion poll this week showed that pro independence parties would win the largest share of the vote, though a majority was not assured and question marks remain over puigdemont s leadership of the pro independence cause. puigdemont could not be reached for comment.  wrong footed at the time of the vilahur talks, prime minister mariano rajoy seemed to hold the upper hand. he had surprised the secessionists by calling elections much sooner than they had expected, according to sources close to puigdemont. a disparate collection of parties whose only common thread is independence, puigdemont s coalition had been bickering over what some saw as his timid tactics. some had even been talking of boycotting the election, which could have spelled the end of the movement.  he was wrong footed by rajoy s tough response,  said an  ally of puigdemont. when rajoy dropped his election bombshell, puigdemont was still celebrating the regional assembly s vote earlier that day to declare catalonia a republic. the catalan leader had to move quickly to secure consensus for the brussels plan and, more importantly, for his unwieldy coalition to contest the elections, which had been called by a nation they no longer considered themselves to be a part of. in puigdemont s first meeting late on oct. 27, in barcelona s regional parliament building, the coalition decided that only a few ministers would go with him to brussels and the rest would stay and defend themselves against any prosecution for sedition, said sources briefed on that meeting. afterwards, he drove to girona, the town he had run as mayor. in a courtyard of a government building, he filmed a message calling for non violent opposition to rajoy s takeover of the region. it was televised by catalan public broadcaster tv3 which called him  president . later, he lunched with his wife and two friends at a local wine bar and walked with them to girona s placa de la independencia (independence square) where he posed for photos while applauding onlookers shouted  long live catalonia . despite the defiant scene, the day was not going well for the newly declared catalan republic. rajoy was receiving backing from world powers including france, germany and the united states. spanish authorities were already taking over catalan government offices. however, puigdemont got some news that appeared to justify his brussels strategy just as he and four of his ex ministers were making their way there. belgium s migration minister, theo francken, said that if puigdemont were to seek political asylum in belgium, it would be  not unrealistic  to grant it. belgium is one of few eu states where eu citizens can request asylum. francken belongs to flemish nationalist party n va, which  is supportive of catalan self determination. he said no asylum request had yet been made but events were  moving fast . puigdemont was meanwhile in a friend s car heading for marseilles, southern france, where he would board a flight to brussels. to elude spanish police, someone drove his official car in a different direction. since arriving in brussels, puigdemont and the four ex ministers who accompanied him there have been slapped with european arrest warrants for rebellion and sedition, crimes carrying up to 30 years in jail. back in spain, eight other ex ministers have been jailed pending an investigation and potential trial for rebellion, sedition and misuse of public funds. puigdemont has not sought asylum but is at liberty in belgium pending a hearing on extradition, which his lawyer has said he will oppose.

" the head of the federal communications commission on thursday released a 58 page draft plan to reverse the landmark 2015 “net neutrality” order and disclosed the agency may withdraw “bright line” rules barring internet companies from blocking, throttling or giving “fast lanes” to some websites. fcc chairman ajit pai, named by trump in january, disclosed his intent wednesday to repeal the obama era rules that reclassified internet service and tightly regulated providers as if they were utilities. the fcc also plans to scrap the 2015 internet conduct standard and an ombudsman position created to hear complaints of net neutrality violations. the plan asks if network disclosure requirements should remain in force for internet providers. pai’s plan faces an initial may 18 vote. he wants public comment on whether the fcc should keep its “bright line” rules, and said his decision on the rules would depend partly on the comments the agency receives. websites such as facebook inc (fb.o), alphabet inc (googl.o) and others back the rules, saying they guarantee equal access to the internet. internet service providers such as at&t inc (t.n), verizon communications inc (vz.n) and comcast corp (cmcsa.o) oppose the obama order, saying they made it harder to manage internet traffic and discouraged investment in improving access. fcc commissioner mignon clyburn and federal trade commissioner terrell mcsweeny opposed pai’s plan, saying it “would allow broadband providers to erect barriers or charge tolls to any application, connected device, or website that the broadband providers’ customers want to reach. it would allow broadband providers to favor their own content over others, and pick winners and losers on the internet.” pai said the 2015 open internet rules were unnecessary because large internet providers did not block websites before they were imposed. “we were not living in some digital dystopia before the partisan imposition of a massive plan hatched in washington saved all of us,” pai said wednesday. the fcc proposal seeks comment “on whether a codified no blocking rule is needed to protect such freedoms.” the order also asks whether a legal bar on throttling “is still necessary, particularly for smaller providers.” the proposal also questions the ban on “paid prioritization” that the proposal argues was adopted to “address an apparently nonexistent problem.” at&t said the question “is not whether the internet will remain open   it undoubtedly will. the question is how, as a country, we will regulate the internet ecosystem.” ",0

" poppy seeds found in two cargoes of imported wheat halted by egyptian authorities are  not very dangerous , agriculture minister abdel moneim al banna told reuters on wednesday, in comments that could avert a trade row. al banna said the cargoes from france and romania would be sieved before a decision was taken on whether to allow them into the country.   the world s biggest wheat buyer has panicked global suppliers in recent weeks by referring the two cargoes to its public prosecutor for containing what it said were drug producing poppy seeds. the prosecutor has yet to issue a final decision on whether the wheat should be re exported. supplier transgrain france and the french embassy in cairo sent letters to state buyer gasc arguing that the strand of poppy, papaver rhoeas, in the wheat was a harmless variety not used in opium production and commonly found in wheat fields. banna s comments are the first by an egyptian official to take a similar view. he said the seeds were  not very dangerous , and that  there is still a study that has not been completed to determine whether to re export it to the country of origin or use it after the sieving.  gasc later said it had determined that the seeds present in the romanian cargo were not harmful as per an agriculture quarantine report and that it would be sieved.  the poppy seeds found on the romanian vessel according to a report that was signed by the head of the agriculture quarantine are not of the harmful opiate kind. the procedure therefore is sieving,  gasc vice chairman ahmed youssef told reuters. traders are watching closely, and have said that any rejection could lead them to boycott the state s massive tenders, protesting what they describe as excessive inspection measures that have made doing business increasingly risky.  all suppliers will wait and see what will happen,  said one cairo based trader. in a similar trade row last year, egypt temporarily banned any trace of ergot, a common grain fungus, in cargoes. that move halted the country s billion dollar grain trade after suppliers said the zero tolerance level was impossible to guarantee. gasc expects to buy about 7 million tonnes of wheat in the fiscal year that began last july in order to supply a bread subsidy program relied on by tens of millions of egyptians. inspectors from egypt s agriculture quarantine service have slammed a food inspection system launched this year that was intended to streamline trade following the ergot dispute. they say the new system, which ends the process of sending egyptian inspectors abroad to check on grain, has allowed harmful contaminants to enter the country. they successfully challenged the system in court, but a verdict to suspend it has not been implemented and is being appealed.  we are being exposed to the biggest campaign to enter the largest quantities possible of poor quality wheat into egypt and to make it the wastebasket of the world,  a quarantine inspector said.

" guo wengui, an exiled chinese billionaire who has accused some of the most senior officials of china s communist party of corruption, has applied for political asylum in the united states, his lawyer said. thomas ragland, a washington based lawyer, said guo, who lives in new york and is in the united states on a tourist visa expiring this year, applied for asylum on wednesday because he feared his accusations had made him a  political opponent of the chinese regime .  this step was taken because of his very real concerns of his safety and risks he would face from the chinese regime because of his videos, his twitter posts, the things that he s said and written,  ragland told reuters by phone on thursday.  guo, who is also known as miles kwok, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. chinese foreign ministry spokesman geng shuang said he was unaware of the situation when asked about it at a daily news briefing in beijing earlier on thursday. guo, who left china in 2014, has emerged as a political threat to china s government in a sensitive year, unleashing a deluge of corruption allegations against high level officials of the ruling party through twitter posts and video blogs. the businessman has made it clear that he wants to disrupt an important communist party congress, which is held every five years and due to begin on oct. 18. despite providing scant evidence to back up his accusations, guo s standing as a former billionaire insider with ties to senior intelligence officials has meant his online video streams and prolific tweeting command attention, as well as the ire of beijing. interpol issued a global  red notice  for guo s arrest in april, at beijing s request, while articles in china s state controlled media have accused him of crimes including bribery, fraud, and embezzlement. guo denies the accusations. guo is also being sued for defamation in the united states by several chinese individuals and companies, including the hna group conglomerate. ragland said guo feared that china could soon file criminal charges against him that were politically motivated and request american authorities to cancel his visa.  filing an application for asylum, ragland said, triggers protections both under u.s. and international law that would allow guo to remain in the country for the duration his application was being processed, the national average for which is two to three years.

" president donald trump survived one of the biggest threats to his presidency when thursday’s hugely awaited congressional testimony by the fbi chief he fired did not yield any explosive new disclosures about his campaign’s alleged ties with russia. but former fbi director james comey’s remarks to a packed hearing of the senate intelligence committee left the republican president far from unscathed. comey recounted in vivid detail conversations with trump that he viewed as an effort to undermine an investigation of possible collusion between the trump campaign and russia. he also said trump’s comments after firing him on may 9 that the fbi was in disarray and that its members had lost confidence in comey “were lies, plain and simple.” still, comey handed trump and his supporters some fresh ammunition when he confirmed he had told the president the investigation was not focused on him personally. even senator marco rubio, who was among a number of republicans who battled trump for the 2016 republican presidential nomination, seemed to be advocating for him at times during the hearing. rubio asked comey why he did not directly tell trump that he thought the president was making inappropriate requests of him. comey replied that he did not know. “i was a bit stunned, and didn’t have the presence of mind,” he said. a republican close to trump said the president felt very good about comey’s testimony, particularly since it bore out his earlier statement that the former fbi director had told him he was not under investigation. but the cloud from the russia probe still hangs heavily over trump’s white house.  comey’s firing set the stage for the appointment of a special counsel, robert mueller, who has taken over the investigation. congressional probes, including one by the senate intelligence panel, are ongoing. russia has denied interference in last year’s presidential campaign. the white house has denied any collusion with moscow. but senator dianne feinstein, a democrat who sits on the intelligence committee, said the matter was nowhere near over. “it’s a big investigation, and these are facts. ... you have to dig for, and do a lot of analysis.” several democrats said trump’s conversations with comey seemed to build a case of obstruction of justice. “the lawyers are going to dig into obstruction of justice,” senator ron wyden, a democrat on the intelligence panel, said after the hearing. “i believe the evidence just keeps piling up that there has been a very real presidential abuse of power.” but paul ryan, the republican speaker of the house of representatives, said trump’s interactions with comey may have reflected his lack of political experience rather than an effort  to pressure the fbi director. ryan said trump may not have been “steeped” enough in the fbi’s independence from the white house. “he’s new in government, and so therefore i think he’s learning as he goes,” he told reporters. “i’m not saying it’s an acceptable excuse. it’s just my observation.” trump could face even more problems over the coming months if the stream of details leaking out about the russia investigation continues to grab the spotlight at a time when the white house wants to focus on priorities such as rolling back the obamacare healthcare law and overhauling the tax code. “it distracts the administration and gives republicans in the house and the senate, many of whom have not been trump supporters from the beginning, a reason to keep their distance and not get behind him,” said andy smith, director of the university of new hampshire survey center, which conducts political polling. “it’s going to be a long summer,” smith said. trump’s core supporters are hunkering down for a fight. great america alliance, one pro trump group, spent $400,000 this week running ads attacking comey, said eric beach, who runs the group. the ad lambasted comey as “just another d.c. insider” and included images of militant attacks abroad to suggest comey had not been focused enough on protecting americans. but the investigation has contributed to a steady erosion of trump’s political capital. according to a reuters/ipsos opinion poll taken from june 1 to 5, even before the comey testimony   38 percent of americans said they approved of trump, versus 58 percent who disapproved.  “i think the situation is getting much more serious for mr. trump,” said jon bond, a political science professor at texas a&m university. “the mueller investigation is going on. i suspect that information that came out in today’s hearings is going to feed into that investigation. it looks like to me that the president is in increasing jeopardy.” ",0
" republican presidential front runner donald trump waded into politically risky territory this week when he accused democrat hillary clinton of exploiting her gender to win votes and said she would have little support if she were not a woman. as trump and clinton, fresh off big wins in five northeastern state primaries on tuesday, circled each other for a potential matchup in the nov. 8 u.s. presidential election, his comments portended what could be an unusually nasty campaign. like other controversial remarks during his white house campaign, trump’s comments drew criticism from a wide spectrum but also reinforced his image   which has been attractive to some supporters   for plain talk that defies political norms. “the only thing she’s got going is the fact that she’s a woman,” trump, 69, said on thursday on nbc’s “today” show, refusing to back down from targeting clinton, 68, for what he called “playing the woman’s card.”     trump’s remarks, reaching into an area of gender attacks that is conventionally seen as off limits, energized democrats. “keep talking, donald trump,” democratic committee national chairwoman debbie wasserman schultz told cnn on wednesday. “every single day when donald trump opens his mouth, he does more to alienate women.” trump, unfazed by the criticism, told supporters in evansville, indiana, that he has gotten a bad rap. “nobody cherishes and nobody respects women more than donald trump,” he said after being introduced by famed former indiana university basketball coach bobby knight. “i will be so much better to women than hillary clinton.” trump, who can be as free with his personal attacks on men,  has consistently polled poorly with women. democrats and republicans both accuse trump of sexism over verbal insults lobbed at fox news anchor megyn kelly and former republican presidential candidate carly fiorina. on wednesday, trump’s closest republican rival, u.s. senator ted cruz of texas, named fiorina, 61, as his running mate should he win the party’s nomination, a move that could help him draw women’s support. “donald has a problem with strong women,” cruz, 45, told reporters in fort wayne, indiana, before a rally. “this is not subtle, it’s not complicated.” u.s. democratic senator barbara boxer, who fended off a 2010 senate challenge from fiorina, said trump is insulting all women when he attacks clinton and other prominent women, such as kelly, in this way. “either trump has spent too much time in his trump tower and has no clue about what’s happening, or he truly dislikes women and are quite threatened by them,” boxer said on msnbc. but trump said women would support his positions on security and jobs. u.s. representative renee ellmers, a republican who has endorsed him, said she believed trump could overcome his unpopularity with women voters with his straight talk. “to me, this is breaking all the rules, this is going against any of the typical history books and elections of the past,” she said. trump’s top aide and other supporters said focusing on clinton’s gender was part of trump’s emerging strategy for the general election and that he had no intention of hewing to traditional rules. “when he is attacked, he will respond,” trump’s campaign manager, corey lewandowski, told reuters. “the campaign is going to proceed under the mantra, which we’ve had in this campaign from day one, which is: let mr. trump be mr. trump.” a reuters/ipsos poll this month showed a big gender gap in opinions about trump. about two thirds of women had an unfavorable view of the billionaire businessman and former reality tv star, while 54 percent of men had a negative view of him. in her political career, clinton has sometimes benefited from missteps by male candidates. her 2000 u.s. senate rival, new york republican rick lazio, was seen as a bully when he stepped close to her on stage during a debate to demand she sign a pledge.  early in her first presidential campaign in 2008, clinton accused her male opponents of “piling on” and said that would prompt more women to support her. then senator barack obama’s comments during a debate in new hampshire that year that she was “likable enough” were seen by some as patronizing, and as helping her win the state’s primary. if trump wins the nomination, his willingness to raise clinton’s gender and other issues could make for one of the most contentious general election campaigns in recent history. “i don’t think there’s going to be any taboos with donald trump,” said james pethokoukis, a scholar with the conservative american enterprise institute. “he’s not going to treat her with any sort of kid gloves.” retired u.s. house speaker john boehner, a republican, weighed in on the presidential race during a talk at stanford university on wednesday, according to the student newspaper, saying he could vote for his golfing and “texting buddy” trump but harshly criticizing cruz. “lucifer in the flesh,” boehner said of cruz, who is a staunch fiscal conservative and who angered many of his  colleagues in congress by leading a government shutdown in 2013. “i get along with almost everyone, but i have never worked with a more miserable son of a bitch in my life,” boehner said. cruz said boehner was allowing “his inner trump” to come out. “what made john boehner mad is that i led a movement of the people to hold washington accountable,” cruz told reporters.

" earnings for minimum wage workers in portland, oregon will rise by $5.50 an hour over the next six years, with lesser increases set for smaller towns and rural areas under a first of its kind measure signed into law on wednesday by oregon’s governor. oregon has been in the vanguard of a growing number of u.s. states and cities that have moved in recent years to bolster the federal minimum wage, which has remained at $7.25 an hour since 2009. the latest measure builds on a current oregon wage floor that already stands at $9.25 an hour statewide under a law enacted in 2002. supporters say such measures are necessary to help low paid workers who have been slipping into poverty due to stagnant earnings and rising living expenses. opponents say raising the mandatory wage floor puts an undue strain on businesses still struggling to rebound from a prolonged u.s. economic slump. the bill passed by oregon’s democratic led legislature and signed by governor kate brown, also a democrat, seeks to strike a balance by setting different pay tiers based on geography. starting july 1, the minimum wage for oregon workers statewide will climb by 50 cents an hour, with graduated increases set at higher rates for the state’s biggest city, portland, as compared to smaller municipalities and rural communities where the cost of living is generally lower. by 2022 under the new statute the hourly minimum wage will rise to $14.75 in portland, to $13.50 in smaller cities and towns, and to $12.50 in rural areas. “it means just an extra $15 or $20 a month starting in july, but for a mom of three just that small amount makes a big difference,” brown said in signing the measure. she said the gradual, differentiated pay hikes would ensure that “businesses have time to plan for the increase. that’s the oregon way.” u.s. labor secretary thomas perez hailed oregon’s approach, adjusting the wage floor according to regional economic differences, as a model for other states to follow until congress passes a higher national minimum wage supported by president barack obama. a democratic backed proposal to raise the federal minimum to $10.10 stalled on capitol hill in 2014. more recent proposals by some lawmakers call for a federal minimum wage of up to $15 an hour. oregon republicans who opposed the increase predicted it would cost businesses in the state $1.2 billion.

" president barack obama seemed to inch a little closer on tuesday to endorsing former secretary of state hillary clinton’s presidential bid. during remarks at a museum dedicated to highlighting the fight for women’s equality, the president, who has made clear his admiration for his one time rival but has not officially endorsed her, said he hoped one day people would be amazed that the united states had not had a female commander in chief. “i want young girls and boys to come here, 10, 20, 100 years from now to know that women fought for equality, it was not just given to them,” obama said of the museum. “i want them to be astonished that there was ever a time when women were vastly outnumbered in the board room or in congress. that there was ever a time when a woman had never sat in the oval office.” clinton is running against u.s. senator bernie sanders of vermont to be the democratic party’s 2016 presidential candidate. she lost the 2008 race to obama, who was then a u.s. senator and who later made her the nation’s top diplomat in his administration. obama, perhaps realizing that people would read his remarks as a hint of support for clinton, tempered them by saying he did not know when a woman would win the white house. “i don’t know how long it’ll take to get there, but i know we’re getting closer to that day because of the work of generations of active, committed citizens,” he said. white house spokesman josh earnest said obama’s remarks indicated the country was ready for a woman president, but he stressed the candidates would be judged on their values and policy agenda. obama remains hugely popular with the base of democratic supporters who helped propel him to the white house and re elect him in 2012. an endorsement of clinton could help her vanquish sanders, who is behind the former first lady in amassing the number of delegates needed to become the nominee but has remained a strong challenger with wins in a number of state nominating contests.

" russia confirmed on monday that donald trump and vladimir putin had discussed forming a joint russian u.s. group on cyber security, an idea that has provoked uproar in washington, but said it was only a tentative proposal.  trump said on twitter early on sunday the two leaders discussed forming “an impenetrable cyber security unit” when they met at the hamburg g20 summit.  the idea was greeted with incredulity by some senior  republicans who said moscow could not be trusted   and the u.s. president later in the day tweeted that he did not think it could happen. “the heads of state did talk about such a possibility,” kremlin spokesman dmitry peskov told a conference call with reporters on monday. “nothing was promised to each other,” he added. “what is positive, they stated their readiness to work in this direction.” the conversation had been “about the possibility of forming such a group”, he said. “whether it will be created or not, time will show.” svetlana lukash, a russian official who was at the hamburg summit, told a news conference earlier on monday putin and trump’s discussion of cyber security had taken up 40 minutes of their meeting, which lasted more than two hours.    “president putin proposed creating a working group,” she said. “this does not mean it should start working immediately, virtually tomorrow.” she added: “the main thing is, this matter was discussed, the united states is ready to consider cooperation in this sphere, and then we will see. “maybe this will be a working group, maybe this will be cooperation on the floor of the united nations. but in any case, our two countries will need to discuss these questions. this is namely what the presidents agreed upon.” she said of the landmark talks between the two men in hamburg: “nobody, except the participants of that meeting, knows how that proposal was formulated and how president trump reacted.”  some media reports may have prematurely assumed that the creation of a joint commission on cyber security was already decided, she said. “that was a proposal. probably, he (trump) is not ready yet for this specific initiative at this stage,” lukash said. trump’s administration has been dogged by investigations into allegations of russian interference in last year’s u.s. election and ties with his campaign. peskov also told reporters on monday the kremlin did not know the identity of the russian lawyer who allegedly met trump’s son, donald trump jr., trump’s election campaign chairman, paul manafort, and his son in law, jared kushner, last year. the new york times said on sunday that trump’s associates met with the kremlin linked lawyer after being promised damaging information about hillary clinton. the newspaper identified the lawyer as natalia veselnitskaya. it said the meeting had taken place in trump tower on june 9, 2016, two weeks after trump won the republican nomination. “no, we don’t know who it is and, certainly, we cannot track down all movements of all russian lawyers both within russia and abroad,” peskov said.

" australian police said on sunday they had arrested a man accused of working on the black market to sell missile components and coal on behalf of north korea, the first charges ever brought in australia over the sale of weapons of mass destruction. the man had been charged with two counts under an act preventing the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, police said, and with another four under legislation enforcing united nations and australian sanctions against north korea. the sydney man was identified by the australian broadcasting corporation and other media as 59 year old chan han choi, who they said had been living in australia for more than 30 years and was of korean descent. he was arrested in the sydney suburb of eastwood on saturday and was due to face court later on sunday, police said. he came to the attention of authorities earlier this year, the australian federal police (afp) said.  this man was a loyal agent of north korea, who believed he was acting to serve some higher patriotic purpose,  afp assistant commissioner neil gaughan told reporters.  this case is like nothing we have ever seen on australian soil,  he said. police will allege the man tried to broker the sale of missile components, including software for the guidance systems of ballistic missiles, as well as trying to sell coal to third parties in indonesia and vietnam. gaughan said the trade could have been worth  tens of millions of dollars  if successful. cash strapped north korea has come under a new round of stricter united nations sanctions this year after pressing ahead with its missile and nuclear programmes in defiance of international pressure. tensions have risen dramatically on the korean peninsula because of the north s ballistic missile launches and its sixth and most powerful nuclear test, as well as joint military drills between south korea and the united states that the north describes as preparation for war. pyongyang claimed that its latest intercontinental ballistic missile launch in november had the range to reach all of the united states.  u.s. secretary of state rex tillerson urged north korea on friday to carry out a  sustained cessation  of its weapons testing to allow talks about its missile and nuclear programmes. however, the north has shown little interest in talks until it has the ability to hit the u.s. mainland with a nuclear tipped missile, which many experts say it has yet to prove. gaughan said the man had been in touch with high ranking north korean officials but no missile components ever made it to australia. he also said there was no indication officials in indonesia or vietnam had been involved in the attempted coal sales.  this is black market 101,  gaughan said.  we are alleging that all the activity occurred offshore, and was purely another attempt for this man to trade goods and services as a way to raise revenue for the government of north korea,  he said. the man faces up to 18 years in jail if convicted. he did not apply for bail and will next face court on wednesday.

" israel said on tuesday that the hezbollah guerrilla group, its most potent enemy in neighboring lebanon, had gained control over that country s u.s. sponsored conventional military, signaling both would be in israeli gunsights in any future war. defence minister avigdor lieberman s remarks were a hard tack from more measured recent israeli estimates that the lebanese army maintained autonomy even if some of its troops cooperated with the better armed, iranian aligned guerrillas. outlining potential threats in lebanon, where israel last fought a war against hezbollah in 2006, lieberman said in a speech:  we are no longer talking about hezbollah alone .   we are talking about hezbollah and the lebanese army, and to my regret this is the reality. the lebanese army has turned into an integral part of hezbollah s command structure. the lebanese army has lost its independence and become an inseparable part of the hezbollah apparatus,  lieberman said. there was no immediate response from lebanon, which is formally in a state of war with israel, nor from the u.s. embassies in beirut and tel aviv.  the lebanese army has previously said it operates independently from hezbollah, most recently during an operation against islamic state militants at the lebanese syrian border, during which the army said there was absolutely no coordination with hezbollah fighters who attacked is from the syrian side. hosting lebanese prime minister saad al hariri in july for aid talks, u.s. president donald trump praised beirut s efforts to stem the spread of islamic state and pledged continued help from washington.  america s assistance can help ensure that the lebanese army is the only defender lebanon needs,  trump said.     the pentagon said washington has provided lebanon with more than $1.5 billion in military assistance since 2006, and that    u.s. special forces have been providing  training and support  for the lebanese army since 2011.  strengthening the laf (lebanese armed forces) also advances a range of u.s. interests in the middle east that includes not only countering the spread of isis (islamic state) and other violent extremists but also stemming the influence of iran and hezbollah in the region,  pentagon spokesman eric pahon said. while welcoming u.s. action against islamic state, israel sees iran, hezbollah and their allies as the greater threat and worries about their entrenchment in syria as they help president bashar al assad beat back a more than six year old rebellion. lieberman said israel sought to avoid going to war again on its northern front, which, he predicted, would include syria.       in anything that transpires, it will be one theater, syria and lebanon together, hezbollah, the assad regime and all of the assad regime s collaborators,  he said.

" a convoy from the united nations and syrian arab red crescent entered towns in the besieged damascus suburb of eastern ghouta on monday, bringing aid to 40,000 people for the first time since june 2016, the united nations said. a tightening siege by government forces has pushed people to the verge of famine in the eastern suburbs, residents and aid workers said last week, bringing desperation to the only major rebel enclave near the syrian capital. the u.n. office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs (ocha) said on twitter they had entered the towns of kafra batna and saqba. the syrian arab red crescent said in a separate tweet that the inter agency convoy had 49 trucks.  they carried food, nutrition and health items for 40,000 people in need, ocha spokesman jens laerke said.  the last time we reached these two locations were in june 2016,  he said. a health worker in saqba who was present when the convoy started to offload said that nine trucks of foodstuffs, including milk and peanut butter, and four trucks of medicines had arrived so far.  technical specialists were on board to assess needs in the towns in order to plan a further humanitarian response, he said.  more aid to complement today s delivery is planned in the coming days,  laerke added. at least 1,200 children in eastern ghouta suffer from malnutrition, with 1,500 others at risk, a spokeswoman for the u.n. children s agency unicef said last week. bettina luescher, spokeswoman of the u.n. world food programme (wfp), said the convoy carried nutrition supplies for 16,000 children. food, fuel and medicine once travelled across frontlines into the suburbs through a network of underground tunnels. but early this year, an army offensive nearby cut smuggling routes that provided a lifeline for around 300,000 people in the enclave east of the capital.

" nato should defend sweden and finland in the event of an armed aggression, although neither country is an alliance member, a senior nato official said on wednesday at an event that underscored growing concerns about russia s military buildup. commodore hans helseth, special adviser to the nato joint warfare center in norway, said the two nations  growing ties to the western alliance increased their risk and nato had a moral obligation to come to their assistance if they were attacked.  their non membership actually lowers the threshold of an armed aggression against the two countries. in my opinion, nato simply has for moral reasons and other reasons to come to the two countries  assistance,  helseth said at the berlin security conference. he said nato remained open to welcoming both nations as members if they chose to join. finland, sweden, denmark, norway and iceland agreed this month to step up defense cooperation and exchange more air surveillance information, part of a broader effort to build up their defenses to counter russian activities. officials from both finland and sweden spoke at the conference about their concerns about russia s military buildup in the arctic and northern europe in general, citing its 2014 annexation of the crimea region of ukraine as a wakeup call. the two countries take part in nato military drills, but they are not covered by article v of nato s foundational treaty which says an attack on one member is an attack on all. both countries know any move to join the alliance would create a backlash in moscow, which opposes any expansion of nato.  a senior russian foreign ministry official on tuesday called for efforts to rebuild ties with european countries, including more communication among military experts. but helseth said there could be  no return to business as usual  with russia given its annexation of crimea and its role in supporting violence in eastern ukraine, as well as its support of syrian president bashar al assad and use of  unfriendly attacks in the cyber domain . top military leaders from nato and member countries spoke at the two day event about their efforts to build up a bigger deterrent to any military aggression by russia. u.s. lieutenant general ben hodges, who heads u.s. army forces in europe, said russia had missed a big opportunity to mend ties with the west by not being more transparent about  military exercises this year. u.s. and nato officials say russian forces far exceeded the 13,000 threshold beyond which a country is obligated to invite military observers. russia says western officials are exaggerating the scope of the exercises. hodges said western nations had achieved an unprecedented level of information sharing during the exercise, and said he hoped that would continue even as nato expands its own capabilities to rapidly move forces to the eastern flank.  he cited concerns about recent activities by russia, including its purchase of 2,000 vehicles to transport tanks by road and moves to take advantage of melting ice in the arctic.      russia is not sitting around waiting to see what happens.

" iranians quickly closed ranks against a hawkish new u.s. approach to tehran, but iran s powerful hardliners are set to exploit the latest dispute with washington to weaken domestic rivals who are open to the west, analysts and insiders say. president donald trump s warning on friday that he might ultimately terminate a landmark 2015 nuclear deal sets the stage for an eventual resurgence of political infighting within iran s complex power structures, officials said. if the accord signed by iran and six major powers does start to fall apart, anyone who strongly promoted it, such as pragmatist president hassan rouhani, could face a career damaging backlash.  that could leave iran s security hardliners unchallenged at home, enabling greater iranian assertiveness abroad that could worsen tensions in the middle east, analysts say. for the moment, solidarity within the islamic republic s faction ridden political elite is the priority.  what matters now is unity against the foreign enemy,  a senior official told reuters on condition of anonymity, like other figures contacted within iran because of the sensitivity of the matter.  our national interest is a priority for all iranian officials.  but rouhani and pragmatists and reformist allies who promoted the deal, which lifted sanctions in return for tehran rolling back technologies with nuclear bomb making potential, may become increasingly politically vulnerable at home.  golden opportunity  for rouhani s critics trump on friday defied both u.s. allies and adversaries by refusing to formally certify that tehran is complying with the accord even though international inspectors say it is.  the growing tension with america is a golden opportunity for hardliners to clip rouhani s wings,  said a rouhani ally, who was involved in the 18 month nuclear talks.  iran s top authority, hardline supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei, guardedly backed rouhani when he opened the door to nuclear diplomacy with world powers, but has repeatedly expressed pessimism about washington remaining committed to it. for rouhani the stakes are high: his rapprochement with the world won him enhanced popularity at home and prestige abroad, dealing a setback to khamenei s hardline allies, who oppose both detente with the west and domestic liberalization. now the tables may be turning.   hardliners will use trump s threat as a sword of damocles over rouhani s head ... while enjoying the economic benefits of the deal,  said tehran based political analyst saeed leylaz, referring to the lifting of tough oil and banking sanctions.   rouhani and his detente policy with the world will be weakened if the deal does not survive,  another senior iranian official said.   and of course an aggressive regional policy is inevitable.  under iran s unique dual system of clerical and republican rule, the elected president is subordinate to the unelected khamenei, who has in the past reasserted control when infighting threatened the existence of the islamic republic. trump s policy will play into the hands of hardliners eventually, said an ally of khamenei.  what matters is the islamic republic and its interests.  tit for tat steps in reaction to trump, rouhani signaled iran would withdraw from the agreement if it failed to preserve tehran s interests. the survival of the deal now is up to the u.s. congress, which might try to modify it or reimpose u.s. sanctions on iran.  but even if the congress refuses to consider sanctions, the deal could still be in jeopardy if washington and tehran resort to tit for tat retaliatory steps.   as long as both sides only exchange words, business will continue as usual,  said leylaz.  since the lifting of sanctions, rouhani has started to repair an economy ravaged by a decade of restrictions on its vital oil industry and issued warm welcomes to global investors. but major european investors could think twice about involvement in iran if tension mounts with the united states and uncertainty grows over survival of the accord.  if european companies don t have the comfort of a political agreement endorsed by the americans they will say stop,  said a senior french diplomat. among european firms that have announced big deals in iran since the deal took effect are planemaker airbus air.pa, french energy group total totf.pa and germany s siemens siegn.de.  trump enraged tehran by saying that the revolutionary guards, which have fought iran s regional proxy wars for decades, was khamenei s  corrupt personal terror force and militia . rouhani said iranians would always stand by the guards.  several officials agreed that trump s hostility would not change iran s regional behavior, determined by khamenei. but if trump somehow made good on his threats,  then iran will adopt a harsher and aggressive regional policy,  said one of the officials familiar with iran s decision making policy. iran and its rival saudi arabia accuse each other of fuelling regional tensions. the sunni muslim kingdom is at odds with tehran s revolutionary shi ite leaders in struggles across the arab world, including syria, yemen, iraq, bahrain and lebanon.  on social policy, rouhani s scope to loosen restrictions on individual freedoms and rights would be crushed by hardliners if  he loses political prestige. hardliners control the judiciary,

" dissent surfaced again in the association of southeast asian nations (asean) after malaysia disavowed a statement issued by the bloc s chairman, the philippines, as misrepresenting  the reality  of an exodus of 430,000 ethnic rohingya from myanmar. the grouping of 10 nations in one of the world s fastest growing regions has long struggled to reconcile conflicting interests in tackling issues such as china s claims over the south china sea and the crisis facing the muslim rohingya.  the philippines, as chair, tolerates the public manifestation of dissenting voices,  the philippine foreign ministry said in a statement on monday. the move showed a  new level of maturity  in pushing asean s principle of consensus when dealing with issues affecting national interests, it added. malaysia had made its position clear  in several asean meetings  in new york, the ministry said, adding that it had to also take into account the views of other members, however. on sunday, malaysia  disassociated itself  from the asean chairman s statement on the grounds that it misrepresented the  reality of the situation  and did not identify the rohingya as one of the affected communities.  myanmar objects to the term rohingya, saying the muslims of its western state of rakhine state are not a distinct ethnic group, but illegal immigrants from bangladesh. senior diplomats and foreign ministers of asean nations discussed the contents of the statement on the sidelines of the united nations general assembly in new york before it was published, the philippine department of foreign affairs (dfa) and malaysian government sources said. no consensus was reached by the asean foreign ministers, however, said two malaysian government officials aware of the discussions.     the chairman s statement released by the philippines did not reflect malaysia s concerns, said one of the officials, who asked not to be named due to the sensitivity of the issue. malaysia has objected once before to a similar statement on the crisis in myanmar s western rakhine state, but sunday s response was unexpected, as the grouping has an overriding policy of non interference in domestic matters. myanmar must halt  atrocities which have unleashed a full scale humanitarian crisis,  malaysian foreign minister anifah aman urged on sunday.  viable and long term solutions to the root causes to the conflict must be found,  he said in a statement. malaysia s dissent, however, only reflects strained ties in asean, said shahriman lockman, a senior analyst with the institute of strategic and international studies in the country s capital.  what s truly exceptional here is not malaysia s move to dissociate itself from the statement,  he told reuters.  it s the failure of the philippines to attempt to reflect the views of all asean member states.  in the statement, the foreign ministers condemned the attacks on myanmar s security forces and  all acts of violence which resulted in loss of civilian lives, destruction of homes and displacement of large numbers of people . more than 400 people have died and 430,000 rohingya muslims have fled rakhine, where an aug. 25 attack on military and police outposts by rohingya militants provoked a military offensive the united nations calls  ethic cleansing .

" maine legislative leaders are set to meet on thursday to discuss whether to push for the resignation of governor paul lepage, a week after he left an obscenity laden voicemail for a lawmaker who had criticized him for making racially charged comments. the meeting comes a day after lepage, a republican who earlier in the week discussed the possibility of not finishing his term in a radio interview, said he would seek “spiritual counseling” but not resign after calling democratic state representative drew gattine a “little son of a bitch, socialist cocksucker.” the democratic speaker of the maine house, mark eves, and the republican president of maine senate, michael thibodeau, will be attending the 4 p.m. edt (2000 gmt) meeting, according to their representatives, as will several lower ranking members of the legislative leadership. the state house and senate both adjourned in april, so the leaders would need to agree on the need for a special session before setting any votes calling for lepage’s resignation or censure. earlier this year a group of lawmakers started an effort to impeach him, contending the governor overstepped his authority by threatening to withhold funds from a nonprofit group that hired a political rival, but that effort collapsed before making it to the full house. lepage has been in the national spotlight for making repeated statements blaming out of state black and hispanic people for the heroin trade in maine. he has rejected any allegations of racism, saying his sole concern is saving lives in the state. the two term governor, whose current term extends through 2018, has apologized for the language he used in the voicemail. gattine has joined the chorus of lawmakers calling for lepage to step down. the minority republican leadership of the house have backed lepage, saying they accept his apology and want to move on.

" the detention of saudi arabia s prince alwaleed bin talal, known for his big bets on citigroup (c.n) and other top western companies, could have an impact on billions of dollars of investments around the world. for many foreigners, prince alwaleed   whose net worth has been estimated by forbes magazine at $17 billion   is the face of saudi business, appearing frequently on international television and in articles on his investments and lifestyle. a 2013 forbes magazine profile described his marble filled, 420 room riyadh palace, a private boeing 747 equipped with a throne, and his 120 acre resort on the edge of the saudi capital with five homes, five artificial lakes and a mini grand canyon. he is also known for his outspoken views on politics   making headlines in 2015 when he called donald trump a  disgrace  on twitter during the u.s. election campaign. prince alwaleed s investments, current and future, may now be in doubt after he was detained in an investigation by a new saudi anti corruption body.  there will be questions on what this all means,  said a senior executive at a european financial institution, who visited riyadh late last month to attend a big international conference promoting saudi arabia as an investment destination.   people will be looking at any kind of international holdings of the people who have been arrested, to see what will be the impact.  aside from a stake in citigroup, prince alwaleed, 62, owns significant stakes in twitter (twtr.n), ride hailing firm lyft and time warner (twx.n).  his investment firm kingdom holding 4280.se   whose share price plunged 10 percent on sunday in response to news of his detention   recently bought about half of a 31.1 percent stake in saudi lender banque saudi fransi 1050.se from france s credit agricole (cagr.pa). prince alwaleed s father was the kingdom s finance minister during the 1960s. prince alwaleed formed kingdom holding in 1979, initially pouring money into real estate in riyadh; in the 1990s he ventured into wall street, investing heavily in citigroup.  he had a close relationship with former citigroup chief executive sanford  sandy  weill, and has nurtured close ties with other wall street leaders including goldman sachs (gs.n) ceo lloyd blankfein.  prince alwaleed increased his stake in citigroup at the height of the global financial crisis a decade ago and he has held on to the stake, saying as recently as last month that he was very happy with the investment.  he s always been a colorful and unofficial public face of saudi arabia, though he has never been a key decision maker in the kingdom,  a gulf based businessman said. during the u.s. election campaign, prince alwaleed demanded that trump withdraw from the election campaign after the candidate pledged to ban muslims  entry into the united states. trump responded by tweeting that the saudi prince wanted to control  our politicians with daddy s money. can t do it after i get elected.  after trump s election victory, prince alwaleed said whatever their past differences, america had spoken, and he  congratulated trump on his victory. prince alwaleed was an early advocate of women s employment in saudi arabia and a lifting of the ban on women driving. in september, king salman ordered that the ban should be lifted next year.

" the world health organization (who) should overturn its decision to appoint zimbabwean president robert mugabe as a goodwill ambassador, global health leaders said on saturday, describing the move as unjustifiable and wrong. britain said mugabe s appointment was  surprising and disappointing  and added that it risked overshadowing the who s global work. the united states, which has imposed sanctions on mugabe for alleged human rights violations, said it was  disappointed.   this appointment clearly contradicts the united nations  ideals of respect for human rights and human dignity,  a u.s. state department spokesperson said.   this selection underscores why the united states continues to push for u.n. reform and leadership actions that uphold our shared u.n. ideals.  who director general tedros adhanom ghebreyesus announced the appointment at a high level meeting on non communicable diseases (ncds) in uruguay on wednesday. the meeting was attended by mugabe, 93. he is blamed in the west for destroying his country s economy and numerous human rights abuses during his 37 years leading the country as either president or prime minister. in a speech, tedros praised zimbabwe as  a country that places universal health coverage and health promotion at the center of its policies to provide health care to all . the former ethiopian health and foreign minister, who was elected last may as who s first african director general, added:  today i am also honored to announce that president mugabe has agreed to serve as a goodwill ambassador on ncds for africa to influence his peers in his region to prioritize ncds.  but the ncd alliance, which represents 28 international health groups seeking to combat chronic diseases, said it was  shocked and deeply concerned  to hear of the appointment, given mugabe s  long track record of human rights violations . jeremy farrar, a leading global health specialist and director of the wellcome trust charity also said the decision was  deeply disappointing and wrong  and called on tedros to be brave and reverse it.  robert mugabe fails in every way to represent the values who should stand for and those that dr tedros has stood for since becoming dg and has done over many years,  farrar said.  brave leaders are willing to listen, rethink and overturn bad decisions, this is one such case,  he said. who spokesman christian lindmeier said the who chief had made the move seeking broad support for the agency s work.   tedros has frequently talked of his determination to build a global movement to promote high level political leadership for health,  he said by e mail.  human rights activists also criticized the move.  hillel neuer, executive director of the geneva based group un watch described the choice by who, a united nations agency as  sickening .  the government of robert mugabe has brutalized human rights activists, crushed democracy dissidents, and turned the breadbasket of africa   and its health system   into a basket case,  he said. he noted that mugabe himself had traveled to singapore for medical treatment three times this year rather than in his homeland.

" shouts of “shame, shame, shame,” erupted in the u.s. house of representatives on thursday as republican lawmakers narrowly defeated legislation to protect the civil rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender employees of government contractors. the measure, an amendment to a veterans and military construction spending bill introduced by new york democrat sean maloney, initially had enough “yes” votes to pass, according to the count in the house chamber. but house republican leaders extended the time allowed for the vote as they urged enough party members to change their positions to defeat it by a vote of 213 to 212. all 183 democrats who voted backed the amendment, joined by 29 republicans. all 213 “no” votes were from republicans. eight house members   three republicans and five democrats   did not vote. lawmakers are allowed to change their vote in the few minutes between voting and the result being declared.     lgbt rights have been a hot button issue during the 2016 election season. national politics have featured debate over whether making cakes for same sex couples violates bakers’ religious freedom or whether the government should decide which public bathrooms are used by transgender people. democrats chanted “shame, shame, shame,” at republicans. “house republicans are so committed to discriminating against lgbt americans, that they broke regular order to force their members to reverse their votes and support republicans’ bigotry,” nancy pelosi, the house democratic leader, said in a statement. republicans who backed the provision said it was necessary to protect the religious rights of military contractors and not intended to be discriminatory. thursday’s emotionally charged vote came hours after the house late on wednesday passed a $602 billion defense authorization bill that included “religious freedom” language that critics said would allow contractors to discriminate against lgbt individuals. the house rules committee had angered democrats by voting along party lines late on tuesday not to allow a vote on an amendment to the national defense authorization act that would have eliminated that language. the house also backed by 265 159 a separate democratic amendment to the spending bill that limits the display of the confederate battle flag on flagpoles at federal veterans’ cemeteries. the measure angered some conservative republicans from southern states, who argue that the flag is a symbol of their heritage. some lawmakers have been seeking to limit displays of the confederate banner since a racially motivated murder of nine black parishioners at a church in charleston, s.c.  last year.

" u.s. labor secretary nominee r. alexander acosta told a senate committee on wednesday he would abide by president donald trump’s directive to review a pending “fiduciary rule” for retirement investment advisers, indicating he believed it goes too far. acosta told the senate committee on health, education, labor and pensions that the fiduciary rule, slated to take effect on april 10 but which the department has proposed delaying, goes “far beyond” regulating the conduct of investment advisers. the trump administration directed the department last month to review whether the obama era rule, which requires brokers offering retirement investment advice to put their clients’ interest first, was burdensome and out of step with current white house policies. acosta likewise expressed reservations about another obama administration rule issued last year that more than doubled the salary ceiling under which employees would be eligible for overtime pay, from $23,660 to $47,476 a year. acosta said he had “serious questions as to whether the secretary of labor had the power to enact this in the first place.” a federal judge in november blocked the rule, which extended mandatory overtime pay to more than 4 million salaried workers. the trump administration must decide whether to defend the rule, and acosta’s statements indicated that, if confirmed, he may decline to do so. however, acosta told senators he was sensitive to the fact that overtime rules have not been updated in more than a decade. during the three hour hearing, acosta said that while he felt both republicans and democrats had the shared goal of protecting the interests of u.s. workers, they may disagree about the best courses of action. ultimately, acosta told the panel, cabinet secretaries are selected by trump and tasked with deploying his administration’s vision. “we work for the president, he is our boss, and so all cabinet officials ... will ultimately follow his direction unless we feel that we can’t and if we can’t, we resign,” acosta said. acosta, a former member of the national labor relations board and dean of the florida international university college of law in miami, was nominated to be labor secretary in february, one day after trump’s original choice, andrew puzder, withdrew.  acosta has had a decades long career in public service and has been through multiple senate vettings for previous appointments, making it is unlikely his nomination will be derailed. if he clears the panel, acosta will come up for a confirmation vote before the full senate.

" president donald trump s policy of  america first does not mean america alone,  vice president mike pence told the u.n. security council on wednesday as he urged reform to make peacekeeping missions more efficient, effective, accountable and credible. the 15 member council discussed how to improve peacekeeping operations during the annual gathering of world leaders at the united nations. there are currently 15 u.n. peacekeeping missions, costing more than $7.3 billion for the next year.  since january, trump s u.n. ambassador nikki haley has led a push to cut costs and is reviewing the mandate of each operation as annual mandates come up for renewal by the security council. trump wants to cap the u.s. share of the peacekeeping bill at 25 percent, down from 28.5 percent, a level he says is  unfair.  the united states is a veto wielding member of the council, along with britain, france, russia and china.  peacekeeping missions must support a political solution; have the consent of the host country; its mandates must be realistic and achievable; every mission must have an exit strategy; and the united nations peacekeeping missions must adjust to progress and failure,  pence said.  in short, when a mission succeeds, we should not prolong it. when a mission underperforms, we should restructure it. and when a mission consistently fails to fulfill the mandates of this council, we should end it,  he said.  the security council unanimously adopted a resolution on wednesday pushing for improved accountability, transparency and effectiveness and to make peacekeepers more flexible. critics worry that harsh cuts could harm operations in volatile african states.  u.n. secretary general antonio guterres has pledged to make u.n. peacekeeping more efficient but has noted that the current budget to fund it is less than one half of 1 percent of global military spending.  across the years and across the globe, fifty five peacekeeping operations have successfully completed their mandate,  guterres told the council on wednesday.  many political missions have done the same.  he appealed for the security council to ensure mandates for missions were clear and that operations were well equipped.

" human rights monitors on wednesday urged myanmar to withdraw a  ban on protests in its largest city, yangon, amid fears that free speech is under pressure under the government led by democracy champion aung san suu kyi.  suu kyi led efforts to end decades of military rule and won a landmark election in the buddhist majority country in 2015, but her civilian government shares power with the military and has no control over the army and police. she has also been roundly criticised in the west for failing to rein in the military over its alleged role in atrocities  against minority rohingya muslims which the united nations has described as textbook ethnic cleansing. the ban on protests, issued this month by a military controlled ministry, restricts all applications for processions or assemblies in central yangon in order to avoid  public annoyance and anxiety  and  disturbance of traffic , according to official documents reviewed by reuters.      the curb came weeks before pope francis  visit to yangon, when he is expected to raise the rohingya, hundreds of thousands of whom have fled the country after a myanmar army offensive in august.  it underscores rising concerns over free speech after recent arrests of journalists and activists in myanmar.   there is no legitimate reason for imposing a ban on all protests in major sections of burma s largest city,  said brad adams, asia director at human rights watch, referring to myanmar by its old name.   this directive was issued by a military officer and should be seen by the civilian government as a direct challenge to its commitment to basic rights for burmese citizens. the government needs to reverse this ban and uphold the rule of law and refuse to capitulate to arbitrary actions by the military.  the order, issued by yangon region security and border affairs minister colonel aung soe moe, instructs authorities in 11 townships to deny all applications for assemblies. it does not say how long the curb will last.  a senior official from the military run general administration department in yangon s ahlone township confirmed that his office has received the order. he declined to be named as he s not authorized to speak to the media.     reuters was unable to contact yangon s police deputy chief by telephone. the office of yangon s chief minister phyo min thein declined to comment. a myanmar court last week jailed for two months two journalists along with their interpreter and driver for violating an aircraft law by filming with a drone. police on sunday arrested an ultra nationalist buddhist monk who has a history of stoking sentiment against the rohingya.  since suu kyi s government took power last year, 93 people including journalists and activists have been charged or arrested under a controversial law that some worry is used to curb criticism of the authorities, according to advocacy group research team for telecommunications law.

" myanmar s civilian president htin kyaw, a close ally of government leader aung san suu kyi, has authorized the police to proceed with a case against two detained reuters reporters accused of violating the country s colonial era official secrets act, a senior government spokesman said. journalists wa lone, 31, and kyaw soe oo, 27, were arrested last tuesday evening after they were invited to dine with police officers on the outskirts of myanmar s largest city, yangon.  the ministry of home affairs has already submitted the case to the office of the president,  zaw htay, spokesman for aung san suu kyi, said by phone late on sunday. he added that the president s office had given approval for the case to go ahead. zaw htay could not be reached on monday to clarify whether htin kyaw or suu kyi had been personally involved in the decision, or if other officials had signed off on the president s behalf. suu kyi, head of the ruling national league for democracy (nld), is barred from the presidency under a constitution written by the military. but she effectively runs the country in the role of  state counselor . approval from the president s office is needed before court proceedings can begin in a case brought under the official secrets act. section 13 of the act states:  no court shall take cognizance of any offense under this act unless upon complaint made by order of, or under authority from, the president of the union.  a number of governments, including the united states, canada and britain, and united nations  secretary general antonio guterres, as well as reuters editor in chief stephen j. adler and a host of journalists  and human rights  groups have criticized the arrests as an attack on press freedom and called on myanmar to release the two men. zaw htay said the journalists  legal rights were being respected.  your reporters are protected by the rule of the law,  he said.  all i can say is the government can guarantee the rule of law.  but two senior figures in the nld on monday joined the criticism of how the two men are being treated. nyan win, a member of the nld s central executive committee and one of suu kyi s defense lawyers during her years of house arrest under junta rule, said it was  unfair  that the families of wa lone and kyaw soe oo were not allowed to contact them or be told where they are being held. he said the police were being  very secretive  and called for  openness , although said the nld was unable to do anything about the issue as it was not being kept informed. although an nld led civilian government took office in april last year the police and home ministry, which are driving the case, remain under the control of the military. win htein, another senior figure in the nld, who was also critical of the journalists  detention, suggested they had probably been set up by the police.  in my opinion this is a trap,  he said.  they met with two policemen and then they were arrested somewhere else with the

[nl8n1dg28o] following the ban, police launched dawn raids across germany on about 190 mosques, flats and offices linked to the group. the federal prosecutor said that since the association itself had not complained about the ban and the two members  complaints had been withdrawn, the prohibition ruling was final. the case comes as germany commemorates last year s islamist motivated attack on a berlin christmas market which killed 12 people and injured many others.

" russian president vladimir putin held talks with egypt s president abdel fattah al sisi on monday, agreeing to resume civilian flights which moscow halted more than two years ago after militants bombed a russian tourist jet over the sinai. putin s latest visit to cairo reflects the deepening ties between russia and egypt, the second largest recipient of u.s. military aid after israel and a strategic u.s. partner in the middle east because of its control of the suez canal. putin, who flew on to turkey, briefly visited a russian base in syria before arriving in egypt and ordered russian forces to start withdrawing from syria after a two year military campaign there. in cairo, egyptian and russian ministers signed a $21 billion deal to start work on egypt s dabaa nuclear power plant and putin said moscow was ready to resume russian civilian flights to egypt. moscow halted civilian air traffic to egypt in 2015 after militants detonated a bomb on a russian metrojet flight, downing the jet leaving from the tourist resort of sharm el sheikh and killing 224 people on board. the attack and moscow s decision damaged egypt s already struggling tourism industry. egyptian airport inspections and talks to resume flights have been going on for months.  the russian security services have reported to me that, on the whole, we are ready for opening the direct air link between moscow and cairo,  putin said.  this would require signing a corresponding intergovernmental protocol.  russia s transport minister told reporters flights could resume in early february, and russia was prepared to sign a protocol with egypt this week. earlier, russian state nuclear company rosatom said the dabaa nuclear station it will build in egypt will have four reactors and cost up to $21 billion. construction is expected to finish in 2028 2029. moscow and cairo signed an initial agreement in 2015 for russia to build the plant, with russia extending a loan to egypt to cover the cost of construction. sisi said the two leaders had also discussed industrial projects, trade and russian investments in egypt, including in the suez canal economic zone. sisi and putin also discussed syria and mutual rejection of u.s. president donald trump s decision to recognize jerusalem as the capital of israel, a move that has triggered protests across the region and from european capitals.  we had a detailed exchange of views on key international issues. our approaches either coincide completely or are really quite close,  putin said.  the high level russian visit comes after the u.s. government in august decided to deny egypt $95.7 million in aid and to delay another $195 million because of its failure to make progress on human rights and democratic norms. russia launched a military operation to support syrian president bashar al assad in september 2015, and there are signs moscow is keen to expand its military presence in the region. neither leader on monday mentioned an announcement from november when russia s government published a draft agreement between russia and egypt allowing both countries to use each other s air space and air bases for their military planes. but putin has been steadily building relations with egypt. on his first visit to cairo in 2015, he was the first leader of a major power to meet with sisi after the former egyptian army commander ousted islamist president mohamed mursi in 2013. that prompted washington to cool relations with egypt, and the u.s. government suspended some military aid. since then the two leaders have increased cooperation, reviving the historical alliance between egypt and soviet union of the 1970s.

" german chancellor angela merkel s conservatives hope to draw the social democrats (spd) into coalition with offers on healthcare and employment, one of her ministers said, but the two camps remain far apart on tax issues. merkel s cdu/csu alliance won a national election in september, but she has so far failed to agree terms with other parties on a coalition that would enable her to serve a fourth term. her best chance now appears to be a reboot of the  grand coalition  with the centre left spd that ran germany from 2013 to 2017 and continues to govern in a caretaker capacity. peter altmaier, acting finance minister and merkel s chancellery chief, told newspaper sueddeutsche zeitung he thought such an alliance was again possible. the spd had previously said it intended to go into opposition after suffering its worst election result in more than eight decades. but germany s two biggest political groups are now set to start exploratory coalition talks next month and hope to decide by jan. 12 whether to open full blown negotiations. asked what offers the conservatives would make, altmaier said:  we ll of course talk with the spd about problems in hospitals and nursing care, improvements for families and children, broadband expansion, qualification for new jobs and how we can reach full employment.  there is overlap with the spd on these areas, he said, adding that helping germany s 900,000 long term unemployed needed to be a key project   an idea likely to go down well with the spd. taxation could be a sticking point, however. senior spd member andrea nahles told german magazine der spiegel her party wanted to press for a higher top rate of tax for individuals and non listed companies and ensure the wealthy paid more.  the conservatives have rejected the idea of higher taxes for the rich. altmaier said that while the conservatives would not draw any red lines ahead of the talks, they wanted a coalition treaty to include a pledge not to raise taxes or increase debt. the spd also wants to scrap germany s dual healthcare system of premium private care and more widely accessible public care to replace it with a single  citizen s insurance . the conservatives fear that would harm competition. nahles said employers and employees needed to pay the same amount towards public healthcare and doctors  fees for public and private healthcare systems should be reviewed. while the conservatives have made clear they are keen on another  grand coalition , the spd has kept the option of tolerating a minority merkel led government on the table. the chancellor rejects that idea. senior spd member and foreign minister sigmar gabriel told the funke newspaper consortium that some of his party colleagues were ready to live with a minority government. but he said he worried about the implications for europe s stability.  i m rather skeptical,  he said in an interview published on friday as political crisis gripped spain, where separatists were set to regain power in catalonia following regional elections.  a shaky government in germany would probably lead to an earthquake in europe   but we need to talk about it.

" the u.s. senate banking committee will hold a confirmation hearing on nov. 28 for jerome powell, president donald trump’s nominee for chairman of the federal reserve, the committee said in a statement on wednesday. trump last week tapped powell, 64, a fed governor since 2012, to become head of the u.s. central bank, breaking with precedent by denying janet yellen a second four year term but signaling a continuation of her cautious monetary policies. powell is quickly garnering support from republican lawmakers, including senate majority leader mitch mcconnell, who met with powell on tuesday and said he looked forward to “supporting his nomination.” republican senator mike crapo, who chairs the banking committee, said on wednesday that powell was “well equipped to lead our economy and the country in a positive direction.” powell is widely expected to continue to raise interest rates gradually, as yellen began to do in late 2015, and to shrink the central bank’s $4.5 trillion balance sheet.

" donald trump’s vow to round up and deport all of america’s undocumented immigrants if he is elected president could shrink the economy by around 2 percent, according to a study to be released on thursday by conservative think tank the american action forum.     the research adds to concerns about the republican presidential nominee’s policy proposals, which range from tearing up international trade agreements to building a wall along the u.s. border with mexico.     about 6.8 million of the more than 11 million immigrants living in the united states illegally are employed, according to government statistics. removing them would cause a slump of $381.5 billion to $623.2 billion in private sector output, the washington based non profit said in its analysis.     the study added that removing those workers could leave potentially millions of jobs unfilled due to a lack of legal workers willing to do them. industries with the highest share of undocumented workers include farming, construction and hospitality, according to the research. “the things donald trump has said are utterly unworkable,” said douglas holtz eakin, the forum’s president, and the top economic adviser to senator john mccain’s 2008 presidential campaign.     asked about the study on thursday, trump said he thought the analysts misunderstood his immigration policy, adding he wanted people to come into the country if they came “through the system.” “i saw that report and they don’t even have it right,” trump said in an interview on cnbc. “we certainly don’t want to shrink our economy.”     trump, who effectively locked up the republican nomination this week, has called for the deportation of anyone living in the united states illegally, arguing foreign workers hold down salaries and contribute to unemployment.     that position has drawn strong opposition from business leaders like the conservative billionaire koch brothers as well as from human rights advocates. trump has further angered opponents by saying mexico was sending rapists and drug dealers to the united states, and by calling for a temporary ban on muslims entering the country to shore up national security.      but his hard line stance on immigration also has triggered strong support among many u.s. voters.     some 52.6 percent of respondents to a reuters/ipsos poll conducted in september said they want to see most or all undocumented immigrants deported, compared with 34.6 percent who want to see most or all of them stay.     the american action forum analysis used data from the bureau of labor statistics to estimate the value of the output from undocumented immigrants.     the study did not factor in potential impacts of mass deportations on consumption, investment and other economic factors, the group said.     the u.s. economy is projected to produce some $18.7 trillion worth of goods and services in 2016, according to the international monetary fund. a loss of $400 billion in output would amount to about 2 percent of that figure.

" lebanon s parliament on thursday approved the first state budget in 12 years, a vital step towards reforming the fragile economy and preventing rising debt spinning out of control.  successive governments have failed to pass annual budgets due to a string of political crises since the 2005 assassination of former prime minister rafik al hariri.  (passing the budget) is a fundamental step on the state s path to reinstating order in the public finances,  minister of finance ali hassan khalil said after the vote.   passing a budget was a priority for the government of rafik s son, saad al hariri, which took office in january. hariri described the 2017 budget as an  historic achievement  and said his government would strive to return the country to financial and political health. a main obstacle to passing the 2017 and previous budgets has been demands from some politicians that an audit of extra budgetary spending from previous years be carried out. but on wednesday, parliament approved a law allowing the budget to be passed before such an audit is completed and giving the minister of finance up to a year to carry it out. the budget passed after three days of discussion by 61 votes for and four against. eight members of parliament abstained.   lebanon s economic growth has been battered by years of paralysis in government decision making and six years of war in neighboring syria. growth slowed to just over 1 percent a year from an average of 8 percent before the syrian war. lebanon s debt has also risen strongly since the war began in 2011. moody s says the debt to gross domestic product ratio, which indicates a country s ability to pay back its debt, is the world s third highest and will reach almost 140 percent in 2018. economists have said a budget was vital to reforming public finances, but that more needs to be done to improve growth and investor confidence in the country: reform the heavily subsidized electricity sector, boost tax collection and upgrade crumbling infrastructure.  the government will begin work on the 2018 budget next week, hariri and khalil said. khalil said it will include a vision to develop the country economically and socially as well as  financial and reform measures to reduce the deficit and increase growth .

" lebanese prime minister saad al hariri said on thursday gulf arab countries were planning no action against lebanon after a political crisis last month thrust it onto the front line of rivalry between saudi arabia and iran.  hariri has been a political ally of saudi arabia but his coalition government includes lebanon s powerful shi ite muslim hezbollah group, an ally of shi ite iran and sworn enemy of sunni muslim riyadh.  last month s political crisis, sparked when hariri announced his resignation while in saudi arabia, raised fear in lebanon that riyadh and its gulf allies would take economic action against the tiny mediterranean country.  in an interview broadcast from riyadh before he returned to lebanon and rescinded his resignation, hariri warned of possible gulf sanctions on lebanon and of a threat to the livelihood of lebanese workers in gulf states.  his remarks on thursday seemed aimed at reassuring that no such action was in the cards.  this is not going to happen. i assure you we have the best relationship with saudi arabia, we have a very good relationship with the uae, and most of the gulf,  he said at a business conference.      the gulf has a problem with one political party in lebanon and does not have a problem with the whole of lebanon,  hariri added, alluding to hezbollah.

" a group of state attorneys general are discussing whether to file their own court challenge against president donald trump’s order to restrict people from seven muslim majority countries entering the united states, officials in three states told reuters. democrat attorneys general are expected to be a source of fierce resistance to trump, much as republican ags opposed former president barack obama. a lawsuit brought by states would heighten the legal stakes surrounding the president’s executive order, signed late on friday, as courtroom challenges to the ban have so far mostly been filed by individuals. officials in the offices of attorneys general in pennsylvania, washington and hawaii said on saturday they were evaluating what specific claims could be filed, and in which court. “we do believe the executive order is unconstitutional,” hawaii attorney general douglas chin told reuters on saturday. he declined to give further detail. the states could decide not to file, and it is unclear how many states would ultimately sign on for such an effort. “there certainly are conversations underway,” said joe grace, a spokesman for pennsylvania attorney general josh shapiro. a trump representative could not be reached immediately for comment. trump, a businessman who successfully tapped into american fears about terror attacks during his campaign, had promised what he called “extreme vetting” of immigrants and refugees from areas the white house said the u.s. congress deemed to be high risk. he told reporters in the oval office on saturday that his order was “not a muslim ban” and said the measures were long overdue. however, his order hit a roadblock late on saturday when a federal judge in new york said stranded travelers could stay in the country. the american civil liberties union, which sought the emergency court order, said it would help 100 to 200 people with valid visas or refugee status who found themselves detained in transit or at u.s. airports after trump signed the order. the department of homeland security said in a statement it would comply with judicial orders but that trump’s immigration restrictions remained in effect.

" paul manafort, who served briefly as donald trump’s election campaign manager, and business associate rick gates are expected to make their first appearances on thursday before the u.s. judge overseeing a criminal case brought by a special counsel investigating campaign ties to russia. manafort, 68, and gates, 45, who also worked on the republican’s campaign, pleaded not guilty before a magistrate judge on monday to a 12 count indictment, ranging from conspiracy to launder money, conspiracy against the united states and failing to register as foreign agents of ukraine’s former pro russian government. also on thursday, former trump campaign foreign policy adviser carter page is scheduled to testify to the u.s. house of representatives intelligence committee behind closed doors about his dealings with russians. page has repeatedly denied serving as an intermediary between trump’s campaign and russia, which had been under u.s. economic sanctions for several years at the time of last year’s election campaign. monday’s charges were an opening salvo by special counsel robert mueller, whose investigators are probing allegations by u.s. intelligence agencies that russia interfered in the election to undermine democratic candidate hillary clinton to help trump. the inquiry also will determine whether or not there was any coordination between russians and associates of the trump campaign. the kremlin has repeatedly denied meddling and trump has denied potential collusion between his associates and russia, calling the investigations a witch hunt. george papadopoulos, another former member of the trump campaign’s small foreign policy team, pleaded guilty to lying to the fbi and will not face trial. a lawyer for papadopoulos declined comment. thursday’s hearing will be the first in the courtroom of u.s. district court judge amy berman jackson, who was appointed by former president barack obama and has handled a series of high profile cases over the past few years. the 2 p.m. (1800 gmt) hearing is expected to focus on setting bail conditions. manafort and gates are under house arrest, released on unsecured bonds of $10 million and $5 million, respectively. manafort, a longtime lobbyist, political consultant and lawyer, and gates should be given stiff bail terms because of their “history of deceptive and misleading conduct”, their “significant financial resources” and the “potentially significant sentences” they face, prosecutors said in a filing tuesday in u.s. district court for the district of columbia. a conviction on conspiracy to launder money alone could carry a sentence of up to 20 years in prison.  prosecutors also said there was a risk of flight. manafort holds three u.s. passports and frequently travels abroad. asked about the information in the filing, manafort spokesman jason maloni said on wednesday his client “looks forward to having these allegations tried before a judge and jury.” kevin downing, manafort’s lawyer, did not respond to a request for comment ahead of the hearing. it is not clear whether gates, who was represented by a court appointed lawyer on monday, has retained counsel. the charges did not state any direct connections to the trump campaign or allegations of collusion. downing said manafort’s work for the ukrainians ended in 2014, two years before he joined the trump campaign in march 2016. manafort served as campaign manager from june to august. in tuesday’s court filing, prosecutors said manafort and gates had connections to ukrainian and russian oligarchs.  downing said earlier this week that there was no evidence the trump campaign colluded with the russian government.

" an israeli man appealed on monday against a german court s ruling upholding kuwait airways  right to ban him from boarding a flight due to his citizenship, a legal decision that triggered sharp criticism from german officials and jewish groups. the appeal argues that the ruling accepted a racist kuwaiti law and allowed the airline to override german laws requiring that airlines transport any passenger with valid travel documents, according to the lawfare project, which filed the appeal.  we cannot allow our laws to be subverted by the state sponsored racism of other nations,  said nathan gelbart, the german attorney for the group, which fights anti jewish and anti israeli discrimination around the world. he said the decision by the frankfurt district court had allowed  anti semitic discrimination to be imported into our country and helped whitewash and sanitize it.  kuwait airways has not commented on the decision. german chancellor angela merkel and other top officials have vowed to fight anti semitism and xenophobia with the full force of the law in recent weeks after protests that included the burning of israeli flags.  merkel s spokesman steffen seibert said germany had a historic responsibility to stand by israel and jews everywhere. anti semitism remains a sensitive issue in germany, one of israel s closest allies, more than 70 years after the end of the nazi era holocaust, in which six million jews were killed. the frankfurt court last month ruled kuwait airways had the right to refuse to carry the israeli man on a flight to bangkok that began in frankfurt and included a stopover in kuwait city since it was abiding by the laws of kuwait, a country that does not recognize the state of israel. it said germany s anti discrimination law applied only in cases of discrimination on the basis of race, ethnic background or religion, not citizenship. the ruling was sharply criticized by german government officials and the central council of jews in germany, which said the kuwaiti law was reminiscent of nazi policies. three german state parliaments in bavaria, hesse and north rhine westphalia, have passed resolutions condemning the airline for its policy. acting transportation minister christian schmidt also raised concerns about the issue in a letter to kuwaiti officials, saying it was  fundamentally unacceptable to exclude citizens because of their nationality,  according to the lawfare project. no comment was immediately available from schmidt s office. a foreign ministry spokesman said germany s ambassador to kuwait had met kuwaiti officials on nov. 28 to deliver the letter and discuss the issue. a spate of anti semitic acts in germany in recent weeks, including the burning of israeli flags, have triggered concern and calls by top officials to put more emphasis on the holocaust in integration courses for migrants. rights groups say anti semitism and violent acts have increased in recent years amid growing support for far right political groups and the influx of over a million migrants from syria and other countries that are at war with israel.

" cooperation between china and the united states will lead to a win win outcome for both sides, but confrontation will bring mutual losses, china said on tuesday, after the united states branded it a competitor seeking to challenge u.s. power. china hopes the united states can abandon its mentality of zero sum games and seek common ground while respecting differences, china s u.s. embassy said on its website.  on the basis of mutual respect, china is willing to exist peacefully with other countries including the united states,  it said.  but the u.s. ought to adapt to, and accept, china s development.  china has always been a contributor to global development and a protector of the international order, foreign ministry spokeswoman hua chunying said later in beijing.       cooperation is the only correct choice for china and the united states,  she said, adding that it was not surprising for the two to have disagreements but that they should find constructive ways to handle them. china s economic and diplomatic activities around the world are broadly welcomed and no country or report will succeed in distorting the facts or deploying malicious slander, she told a daily news briefing. as the world s two largest economies, china and the united states have a responsibility to protect global peace and stability and promote global prosperity, hua added.  we urge the u.s. side to stop intentionally distorting china s strategic intentions.  in a new national security strategy based on u.s. president donald trump s  america first  vision on monday, the united states lumped china and russia together as competitors seeking to erode u.s. security and prosperity.                the singling out of china and russia as  revisionist powers  comes despite trump s own attempts to build strong relations with chinese president xi jinping as the two sides seek to rein in north korea s nuclear and missile programs. the new u.s. strategy reflects an unwillingness to accept the reality of china s rise, the state run global times said in an editorial.   but because of the enormous size and strength china has already achieved, they won t be able to suppress china,  the widely read newspaper said. however, trump was basically reiterating his standard line on china rather than threatening any specific action, said shi yinhong, head of the centre for american studies at beijing s renmin university.  since he took office the chinese government s line on trump has always been: don t really look at what he says, but look at what he does,  said shi, who has advised the government on diplomacy.  so the strong words against china in the report the chinese government won t really care about.   a senior u.s. administration official said china was attempting to revise the global status quo through its aggression in the south china sea.  china says its expansion of islets in the south china sea is for peaceful purposes only and it can, in any case, do what it wants, as it has irrefutable sovereignty there. the u.s. administration also warned that intellectual property theft by china was a national security problem.

" a new york comedian has been compelled to appear before a house intelligence committee investigating suspected russian meddling in the 2016 u.s. election where he will likely face questions about acting as a go between for wikileaks and an ally of president donald trump.  randy credico, a political activist who hosted a radio show on new york radio, is scheduled to appear in front of the committee on dec. 15, according to a photo of the subpoena posted on his twitter account.  on several occasions over the last few years, credico interviewed and met with wikileaks founder julian assange, a man believed by some u.s. officials and lawmakers to be an untrustworthy pawn of russian president vladimir putin.  assange’s group released democratic emails during the 2016 presidential campaign that u.s. intelligence agencies say were hacked by russia to try to tilt the election against democratic candidate hillary clinton. he is regarded with distaste by many in washington, although trump, then the republican candidate, supported the group’s email releases last year. credico has also interviewed republican political consultant roger stone, a longtime trump ally, who he worked with in the past to reform new york’s drug laws, according to the new york times.  stone flatly denied allegations of collusion between the president’s associates and russia during the 2016 u.s. election in a meeting with house of representatives intelligence committee in september.  during his appearance in front of the committee, stone refused to identify an “opinion journalist” who had acted as a go between between stone and assange. according to stone’s own account to reuters, he “reluctantly” identified the journalist as credico in written communication to the committee.  the committee has been interested in predictions that stone made about damage the email release would have on clinton’s campaign, the times reported.

" illinois’ long running budget stalemate was set to spill into the summer on monday, as democratic lawmakers worked to pass a 2017 spending plan that republican governor bruce rauner has threatened to veto, possibly jeopardizing public schools re opening in august. as a midnight tuesday deadline to pass legislation approaches, rauner and his democratic rivals who control the state legislature reported no headway toward ending the 11 month long dispute that has left illinois as the only state without a full operating budget for the current fiscal year. the second year governor says the budget is $7 billion short on revenues. he has insisted that the budget should be tied to a series of labor weakening, business friendly changes that democrats argue will harm the state’s working class. in recent weeks, legislative working groups convened by rauner have tried to bridge differences between the governor and top democrats. rauner and the democratic legislative leaders met for less than a half hour on monday with house speaker michael madigan declaring plans to keep his legislative chamber in session during june, when a tougher three fifths majority vote is required to pass a budget. “my view is that if there’s no agreement (tuesday) night, i would ask the governor to keep his working groups functioning on a regular schedule because the house is going to be in continuous session,” madigan told reporters after the meeting. senate president john cullerton signaled his chamber could vote on a budget bill passed by the house last week, or on an alternative plan he declined to outline. he also said he was trying to round up votes for the house budget bill. “[tuesday] would be a good day to call it,” cullerton said. republican legislative leaders slammed democrats for their refusal to accept pieces of rauner’s non budgetary agenda or offer revenue sources to pay for their spending plan. “they’re just forcing a tax increase. that’s what they’re doing,” said senate republican leader christine radogno, adding that democrats plan a post november election tax hike vote. contained within the democratic spending package is a $760 million increase in funding for illinois’ public school system for the fiscal year that begins july 1. a complete rauner veto of the package would mean schools would be left without adequate state funding in august when schools are set to open for the fall, a gambit cullerton predicted the governor could not risk.

" the united states has called on cambodia to reverse steps that  backtracked on democracy  before a general election next year, a visiting u.s. official said on wednesday. relations between cambodia and the united states have hit their lowest in years after the arrest of a rival of long serving prime minister hun sen, kem sokha, and the dissolution of his opposition cambodia national rescue party (cnrp).  hun sen accused kem sokha and his party of a u.s. backed anti government plot. the opposition leader and the united states denied that.  we are advising that these steps that have taken place here that have backtracked on democracy could be reversed,  said patrick murphy, deputy assistant secretary of state for southeast asia, the most senior u.s. official to visit since the cnrp was dissolved. murphy told reporters in phnom penh that cambodia still had time before the general election in july to  conduct an electoral process that is legitimate . hun sen looks set to extend his 32 year rule easily next year after eliminating the cnrp, which had made big gains in the last general election in 2013. on tuesday, the european union followed a u.s. lead in suspending funding for the election.  kem sokha has been accused of plotting treason with unidentified americans and the cambodian supreme court dissolved his party last month at the government s request. kem sokha said the charges were a political ploy. murphy said allegations of a u.s. backed plot were a fabrication.  we want a good relationship,  he said.  there is a little bit of friction, a little bit of noise in the official bilateral relationship but we remain optimistic.  during his visit, murphy met senior officials but no government ministers. he also met civil society groups. ouch borith, secretary of state at the foreign ministry, who met murphy on tuesday, told reporters their talks had been about improving the relationship.  he defended his government s actions.  what we ve done is in the legal framework to defend cambodia s independence, peace and stability. we didn t do anything illegal,  he said. reaction to the dissolution of the cnrp has been largely muted in cambodia.  rights groups have decried what they say is an increasingly repressive atmosphere in the southeast asian nation, and have condemned the detention of several reporters and closure of some media outlets. hun sen has shrugged off criticism from the west. china, cambodia s largest aid donor, has leant its support to hun sen saying it respects cambodia s right to defend its national security.

" frustrated u.s. lawmakers called on tuesday for a high powered response to north korea s nuclear tests, saying washington should act alone if necessary to stiffen sanctions on companies from china, russia and any country doing business with pyongyang.  i believe the response from the united states and our allies should be supercharged,  said representative ed royce, chairman of the house of representatives foreign affairs committee.  we need to use every ounce of leverage ... to put maximum pressure on this rogue regime,  the republican congressman told a hearing on north korea.  time is running out.  the u.n. security council stepped up sanctions on monday following pyongyang s sixth nuclear test on sept. 3, imposing a ban on textile exports and capping oil imports.  it was the ninth sanctions resolution unanimously adopted by the council since 2006 over north korea s ballistic missile and nuclear programs. to win chinese and russian support, washington dropped demands including a bid for an oil embargo. at the hearing, u.s. officials released american intelligence findings on how north korea smuggles coal and commodities to russia and china. assistant treasury secretary marshall billingslea displayed slides showing ships he said picked up coal and other commodities in north korea, illegally turning off their electronic identification systems to hide the fact that they were carrying cargo to china and russia.  pyongyang falsifies the identity of vessels to make it harder for governments to determine if ships docking in their ports are linked to north korea,  billingslea said. an aug. 5 u.n. resolution banned north korean exports of coal. russia and china both say they respect u.n. sanctions. committee members expressed frustration that previous sanctions had not deterred pyongyang.  we ve been played by the kims for years,  republican representative ted poe said, referring to north korean leader kim jong un and his predecessors. lawmakers pressed billingslea, and acting assistant secretary of state susan thornton for evidence new sanctions would be more effective. they acknowledged there had not been sufficient evidence that past sanctions had worked, but insisted the administration would work for a better result this time.  we can designate chinese banks and companies unilaterally, giving them a choice between doing business with north korea or the united states,  said royce, who had breakfast on tuesday with secretary of state rex tillerson.  we should go after banks and companies in other countries that do business with north korea the same way,  he said.

" european leaders and president barack obama on friday will discuss extending sanctions imposed on russia for its intervention in ukraine, and possible new sanctions for its bombing in syria, sources familiar with the plans said. the meeting in berlin, hosted by german chancellor angela merkel and including the leaders of britain, france, italy and spain, comes a little over a week after donald trump’s victory in the u.s. presidential election. trump has indicated that he will seek a rapprochement with russia, raising doubts in europe about the future of the sanctions regime introduced by washington and brussels in 2014 following russia’s intervention in eastern ukraine. a german official said the plan was to agree a rollover of eu sanctions against russia, which are due to expire at the end of january, in the coming weeks. there is concern that trump might move in the opposite direction after his inauguration on jan. 20. european leaders will therefore be seeking clarity from obama, who met trump last week and said afterwards the president elect would maintain core relationships around the world, including with nato. obama arrived in berlin on wednesday evening after visiting greece.  “we’re in a really critical situation,” said the german official. “we have to prevent a situation where the eu rolls over the sanctions and then the new u.s. president comes in and lifts them.” obama and merkel are expected to hold talks on thursday followed by a news conference at which they will raise the issue of syria, a source said. european officials fear that russia will use the time before trump’s inauguration to launch new offensives in syria and ukraine. two diplomatic sources said the issue of syria would also come up at the friday meeting. “syria will definitely be on the agenda,” said one, citing coordinated russian missile strikes against rebels in syria launched on tuesday from an aircraft carrier in the mediterranean. the kremlin has said it is maintaining a moratorium on air strikes in the city of aleppo. european union leaders last month condemned russia for its bombing of civilians in aleppo and signaled that they could introduce new sanctions for its actions there if the bombing continued. the syrian opposition has been pressing western countries to expand sanctions to include some russian firms that are supplying weapons and bank notes to syria. syrian opposition leaders are due to meet with eu leaders, including eu foreign policy chief federica mogherini, in brussels on friday. another source said european leaders were keen to send a signal to trump, making it more difficult for him to reverse u.s. policy and cosy up to russia.

" seoul and beijing on tuesday agreed to move beyond a year long stand off over the deployment of a u.s. anti missile system in south korea, a dispute that has been devastating to south korean businesses that rely on chinese consumers. the unexpected detente comes just days before u.s. president donald trump begins a trip to asia, where the north korean nuclear crisis will take center stage, and helped propel south korean stocks to a record high. the installation of the u.s. terminal high altitude area defense (thaad) system had angered china, with south korea s tourism, cosmetics and entertainment industries bearing the brunt of a chinese backlash, although beijing has never specifically linked that to the thaad deployment. beijing worries the thaad system s powerful radar can penetrate into chinese territory.  both sides shared the view that the strengthening of exchange and cooperation between korea and china serves their common interests and agreed to expeditiously bring exchange and cooperation in all areas back on a normal development track,  south korea s foreign ministry said in a statement. before the thaad dispute, bilateral relations flourished,  despite beijing s historic alliance with north korea and seoul s close ties with washington, which includes hosting 28,500 u.s. troops. china is south korea s biggest trading partner.  at this critical moment all stakeholders should be working together to address the north korea nuclear challenge instead of creating problems for others,  said wang dong, associate professor of international studies at china s peking university.  this sends a very positive signal that beijing and seoul are determined to improve their relations.  as part of the agreement, south korean president moon jae in will meet chinese president xi jinping on the sidelines of the summit of asia pacific economic cooperation (apec) countries in vietnam on nov. 10 11. south korea recognized china s concerns over thaad and made it clear the deployment was not aimed at any third country and did not harm china s strategic security interests, china s foreign ministry said. china reiterated its opposition to the deployment of thaad, but noted south korea s position and hoped south korea could appropriately handle the issue, it added.  china s position on the thaad issue is clear, consistent and has not changed,  chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman hua chunying told a daily briefing in beijing. the thaw is a big relief for south korean tourism and retail firms as well as k pop stars and makers of films and soap operas, which had found themselves unofficially unwelcome in china over the past year. in south korea, a halving of inbound chinese tourists in the first nine months of the year cost the economy $6.5 billion in lost revenue based on the average spending of chinese visitors in 2016, data from the korea tourism organization shows. the spat knocked about 0.4 percentage points off this year s expected economic growth, according to the bank of korea, which now forecasts an expansion of 3 percent. the sprawling lotte group, which provided the land where the thaad battery was installed and is a major operator of hotels and duty free stores, has been hardest hit. it faces a costly overhaul and is expected to sell its chinese hypermarket stores for a fraction of what it invested. a spokesman for holding company lotte corp expressed hope that south korean firms  activity in china would improve following the announcement. an official at seoul s presidential blue house, who declined to be named given the sensitivity of the matter, said improvements for south korean companies would come slowly. shares in south korean tourism and retail companies rallied nonetheless, with asiana airlines gaining 3.6 percent and lotte shopping up 7.14 percent. the benchmark kospi index hit a record for a third straight day, gaining 0.9 percent. china has grown increasingly angry with north korea s ongoing pursuit of nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles in defiance of united nations sanctions, even as it chafes at u.s. pressure to rein in its isolated ally. the recent deterioration in ties between china and north korea may have contributed to tuesday s agreement, the blue house official said. pyongyang has undertaken an unprecedented missile testing program in recent months, as well as its biggest nuclear test yet in early september, as it seeks to develop a powerful nuclear weapon capable of reaching the united states. the head of nato on tuesday urged all united nations members to fully and transparently implement sanctions against north korea.  north korea s ballistic and nuclear tests are an affront to the united nations security council,  nato secretary general jens stoltenberg said in tokyo, where he met japanese prime minister shinzo abe. separately, a south korean lawmaker said north korea probably stole south korean warship blueprints after hacking into a local shipbuilder s database last april. expectations had been growing for a warming in the frosty bilateral ties following this month s conclave of china s communist party, during which xi cemented his status as china s most powerful leader after mao zedong. earlier this month, south korea and china agreed to renew a $56 billion currency swap agreement, while chinese airlines are reportedly planning to restore flight routes to south korea that had been cut during the spat. tuesday s agreement came after high level talks led by nam gwan pyo, deputy director of national security of the blue house, and kong xuanyou, assistant foreign minister of china and the country s special envoy for north korea related matters.

" anthony weiner, the disgraced former u.s. congressman, has emerged as an unexpected figure in the federal bureau of investigation’s inquiry into hillary clinton’s handling of classified government information on a private email server she used while secretary of state. the fbi said on friday it is examining newly discovered emails related to the server investigation, giving new life to a scandal less than two weeks before clinton stands as the democratic candidate in the u.s. presidential election. the fbi called clinton’s handling of government secrets “extremely careless” in july after a year long investigation, but recommended against criminal charges. fbi agents have now found emails on devices belonging to huma abedin, one of clinton’s closest aides, and weiner, abedin’s estranged husband, according to unnamed law enforcement officials. a brooklyn native, weiner, 52, represented parts of new york city in the u.s. house of representatives for more than a decade, and his marriage to abedin was officiated by bill clinton, the former u.s. president and hillary clinton’s husband. weiner was best known for his fiery speeches and acerbic, combative wit until 2011, when he was forced to step down after he posted a photograph of his crotch on twitter. he admitted the picture was a private communication made public by mistake, and that he had been exchanging sexually charged pictures and messages with multiple women. after atoning in press interviews for the strain he placed on his marriage with abedin, weiner re entered public life in 2013 as a candidate for mayor of new york city. the city’s voters for a while embraced his comeback, and he was atop the public polls when revelations broke he had never shaken his sexting habit. he admitted he had continued to swap messages and pictures with women using the alias carlos danger. abedin, who has worked for clinton since she was 19, decided against joining her husband at the polling booth on the day of weiner’s loss in the mayoral race, but remained married to him as they raised their young son together. while a diminished weiner worked as a television commentator, abedin, who had left the state department with clinton in 2013, focused on clinton’s forthcoming presidential campaign, for which she was appointed vice chairwoman. clinton rarely appears in public without abedin somewhere nearby. multilingual, intensely private and with a glamour validated by vogue magazine photo shoots, abedin became a star in her own right as clinton campaigned across the country, obliging countless requests by clinton supporters to pose for their smartphone cameras.  no, and this year it reached a breaking point. in august, abedin announced she was separating from weiner after a newspaper published a picture weiner sent to a woman of him lounging on his bed in his underwear; weiner’s and abedin’s four year old son could be seen at his side. the fbi began investigating after it emerged that one of his sexting partners was 15 years old, a legal minor. the agency seized devices used by both weiner and abedin, finding the new email cache soon after. investigators are looking to see if yet more classified information appears in the new cache. yes. clinton’s republican rival for the presidency has devoted his last few rallies to reveling in the news, a diversion from accusations by multiple women that trump groped them. clinton, who remains ahead in public polls, argued on friday that most voters may have already decided whether or not clinton’s mishandling of classified information in her emails is disqualifying. clinton has called abedin, 40, a surrogate daughter, and the aide was at clinton’s side even after the news broke on friday. her loyalty to clinton is unmistakable in the hundreds of emails of hers that have already been made public. abedin has spent more than two decades accruing knowledge of clinton’s habits, preferences, scheduling and alliances, and may be viewed as irreplaceable.

" across asia, more and more countries are being pulled into beijing’s orbit, with the timid stance adopted by southeast asian nations on the south china sea at a weekend summit a clear sign this fundamental geostrategic shift is gathering momentum. u.s. president donald trump’s flurry of calls at the weekend to the leaders of the philippines, thailand and singapore might cheer those who fear his predecessor barack obama’s “pivot” to asia has been abandoned in favor of an “america first” agenda. but white house chief of staff reince priebus said the conversations were aimed at lining up asian partners in case tensions over north korea lead to “nuclear and massive destruction in asia”, and mentioned no broader strategic goal. southeast asian nations will need more than that to convince them the united states still has their backs. in the meantime, some are leaning closer to china, soft pedalling quarrels over the disputed south china sea and angling for a slice of beijing’s “one belt, one road” infrastructure investment program to compensate for the u.s. abandonment of the trans pacific partnership trade pact. the unexpected bonhomie that has emerged between trump and chinese president xi jinping could give asian countries further confidence to continue their swing toward beijing. “before, most southeast asian states wanted to benefit from chinese regional economic initiatives and from american pushback against china,” said malcolm cook, a senior fellow at the institute of southeast asian studies in singapore. “the second part of this balance is now in question. hence, the pressure to acquiesce to china diplomatically and on security issues is stronger.” philippines president rodrigo duterte, piqued by the obama administration’s criticism of his human rights record, last year announced his “separation” from longtime ally the united states while on a visit to beijing. the white house described trump’s conversation with the firebrand philippines leader as “very friendly” and   prompting criticism from human rights watch for “effectively endorsing duterte’s murderous war on drugs”   invited him to washington. but, underlining his new found friendship with beijing, duterte on monday inspected a chinese naval ships docked at his hometown, the first visit of its kind to the philippines in years. duterte, who last year put aside a legal challenge to beijing’s sweeping territorial claims in the south china sea to start negotiating billions of dollars worth of loans and infrastructure investments, chaired the latest summit of the 10 nation association of southeast asian nations (asean) in manila. several asean diplomats said china sent officials to lobby the philippines ahead of the summit, and before the leaders had even gathered duterte said it was pointless pressuring beijing over its maritime activities. an early draft of the summit statement seen by reuters made references to land reclamation and militarization in the disputed waterway, but they were subsequently dropped, as were references to “tensions” and “escalation of activities”.  cook said it was clear that, with the philippines steering the summit to this conclusion, “it is no longer just cambodia that is acting as an agent of chinese influence in asean over the south china sea dispute”. thailand and malaysia have also moved closer to china. thailand’s relations with washington came under strain during the obama administration because of concerns about freedoms under its military dominated government. trump invited prime minister prayuth chan ocha to visit washington during their call on sunday, but the former general’s government has its eyes elsewhere: last week it approved the first of three submarine purchases from china worth more than $1 billion. singapore prime minister lee hsien loong says washington’s new posture has shifted asia’s political and economic balance. lee, whose country, like vietnam, has shown no signs of moving closer to beijing, stressed to his asean counterparts on saturday that, despite trump’s “radically different approach”, they should balance their ties between the united states and china. trump has said he will attend two summits in the region in november. but southeast asian nations are trying to gauge how far they can still rely on washington as a shield against chinese assertiveness. asean foreign ministers will be seeking answers at a meeting with secretary of state rex tillerson in washington this thursday. uncertainty over washington’s commitment, analysts say, will only draw asean countries further toward china, which can lure them with cheap loans, infrastructure investments and tariff cuts, but with a risk of diminished bargaining power. thitinan pongsudhirak, director of the institute of security and international studies at bangkok’s chulalongkorn university, said it was imperative for asean to regain leverage by bringing washington back into the equation and expanding the influence of japan. “asean is in a precarious position now with the concessions, accommodation and even appeasement with china,” thitinan said.    “if china continues to be shrewd and takes asean on another ride, then asean will be much worse off.” ",0
" ronald vitiello has been appointed chief of the u.s. border patrol, according to an internal memo seen by reuters on tuesday, replacing mark morgan, who had been asked to step down as the agency moves toward tougher immigration enforcement under the trump administration. vitiello’s appointment was announced in a memo by kevin mcaleenan, acting commissioner of the u.s. customs and border protection, which oversees the border patrol.

" boxy russian built lada automobiles still rattle around cuba, growing more decrepit by the year, a reminder of vanished soviet patronage for the communist led island. but next month, more than 300 shiny new ladas are slated to roll onto havana s potholed streets, the first in more than a decade. their manufacturer avtovaz, russia s biggest carmaker, says it hopes to ramp up exports, thanks to financing from russian government development bank veb. flush with state funding, avtovaz and other russian companies are once again increasing sales to the caribbean isle. it is part of a broader move by moscow to renew commercial, military and political ties just as the u.s. government is retreating from cuba under republican president donald trump. russian exports to cuba jumped 81 percent on the year to $225 million in the january september period, official russian data shows. that is just a quarter of the exports of cuba s chief merchandise trading partner, china, but growing fast. russian state oil major rosneft in may resumed fuel shipments to cuba for the first time this century. the company s head met with cuban president raul castro in havana on saturday, the latest sign the two countries are readying a major energy agreement. the nations in the past have discussed increased deliveries of russian oil to the island and development of cuba s offshore oil fields.  that would be a major assist for cuba amid slumping shipments of cheap fuel from its troubled socialist ally venezuela. last month, private russian company sinara delivered the first of 75 locomotives worth $190 million ordered by cuba in 2016. russia s largest truck maker kamaz has also stepped up exports to cuba.  negotiations for rail lines and other infrastructure are in the works.  we can call this period a renaissance,  aleksandr bogatyr, russia s trade representative in cuba, said in an interview. he forecast bilateral trade could grow to $350 million to $400 million this year, one of its highest levels in nearly two decades, up from $248 million in 2016. russia s cuba offensive comes as trump has halted efforts by his democratic predecessor barack obama to normalize u.s. cuba ties and ease the decades old u.s. trade embargo. in june, trump ordered tighter travel and commercial restrictions again, disappointing u.s. businesses that had hoped to capitalize on the detente. in september, his administration slashed u.s. embassy staffing in cuba. moscow is seizing on that rollback as a way to undermine u.s. influence in its own backyard, some foreign policy experts say.  russia sees it as a moment to further its own relationship with cuba,  said jason marczak, director at the adrienne arsht latin america center.  the more the russian footprint increase in cuba, the more that will reinforce hardened anti u.s. attitudes and shut out u.s. businesses from eventually doing greater business in cuba.  throughout the cold war, moscow propped up fidel castro s revolutionary government, providing it with billions of dollars worth of cheap grain, machinery and other goods. those subsidies disappeared with the 1991 collapse of the soviet union. trade plunged.  under russian president vladimir putin, who longs to return his nation to superpower status, moscow over the past decade has sought to revive relations with latin america, particularly with countries wary of u.s. influence. the turnaround with cuba got a boost in 2014 when russia forgave 90 percent of cuba s $35 billion soviet era debt. it also started providing export financing to russian companies looking to sell to the cash strapped island. the help has been cheered in cuba, where raul castro is due to step down next year, marking the departure of the generation that led the 1959 cuban revolution. russia may lie half a world away from cuba, but traces of its historic ties with the caribbean s largest island are everywhere. older generations learned russian and studied in the soviet union. at a recent trade fair in the capital, cubans spontaneously sung along to the folk music played at the opening of russia s pavilion. moskvich and lada cars, ural motor bikes and kamaz trucks chug along the streets. most cuban farm equipment is from the former soviet union. that legacy alone has sustained some russian trade.  we sell spare parts for ground transport, some planes, agriculture, construction,  said russian businessman igor leonov. he set up his import company, ces co. ltd, in cuba nearly thirty years ago and says there is plenty of demand. the decades old u.s. trade embargo has also forced cuba to remain loyal to some russian manufacturers. the island upgraded its soviet era fleet in the 2000s with russian built tupolev, antonov and ilyushin planes. nadezhda lesova, an executive at the russian export center in moscow, said her organization regarded cuba as a  strategic region.  she said the center is providing support for exports to cuba, including insurance, loans and subsidies, worth around 430 million euros ($508.60 million). some major deals are under discussion.  state owned monopoly russian railways (rzd) is negotiating to upgrade more than 1000 km of cuban railroads and install a high speed link between havana and the beach resort of varadero, in what would be cuba s biggest infrastructure project in decades.  it is expected the deal will be worth 1.9 billion euros  ($2.26 billion) and will be signed by the end of the year,  oleg nikolaev, deputy chief executive officer at the rzd subsidiary rzd international, told reuters. in october, oil firm rosneft said it was looking at modernizing the island s cienfuegos oil refinery. but the optimistic talk could be overblown. venezuela and china have announced investments in cuba that came to naught, largely due to the complications of doing business in cuba. some russian companies are already smarting from cuba s cash crunch. ces co. ltd, the parts importer, said cuba was behind on $9 million in payments. and it is unclear how long russia will continue to finance exports, with its own economy struggling amid low oil prices and western sanctions. russia s economic constraints are one reason analysts are dubious that moscow will make good on recent proposals to re open a former base in cuba. shuttered in 2001, the so called lourdes base was used for electronic surveillance of the united states. still, u.s. military experts are concerned that russia could leverage increased economic influence in cuba to step up its military and espionage activities on the island. sixteen high ranking military officers wrote an open letter to the trump administration in april asking it to continue obama s opening with cuba for national security reasons.  if russia is willing to offset oil supplies from venezuela and some other things, maybe cuba doesn t have much of a choice but to let them re establish political warfare operations there,  retired u.s. army brig. gen. david l. mcginnis, one of the signatories, said in an interview with reuters. paul hare, a former british ambassador to cuba, sees russia s renewed interest in cuba as geostrategic.     it s hard to see a business interest, as cuba can t pay,  said hare, who now lectures at boston university s pardee school of global studies.  the russians will do just as much as they want to prop up cuba so as to be a nuisance to the united states.

" swapping new cars for cheaper models, cutting back on pricy supermarket shopping and giving up holidays abroad, middle class egyptians are finding strategies to stay afloat after a currency reform a year ago sent their living costs soaring. egypt floated its pound in november 2016 as part of a $12 billion international monetary fund loan package, and the currency lost half its value, eroding spending power and pushing inflation to record highs over 30 percent this summer. president abdel fattah al sisi s government has been praised by imf and world bank economists for reform progress and for measures to shield the poorest from the fallout. but middle income egyptians say it has been a year of cutbacks, cost saving and crisis management.  presidential elections are due early next year and sisi is expected to seek another term. but some egyptians are finding that their new economic reality is crowding out politics as they struggle to maintain standards. others are digging deep and insist that despite the pain of austerity, sisi remains the only candidate to provide stability after the years of turmoil that followed the 2011 uprising that ousted hosni mubarak. overcoming voter apathy may be a challenge if the former military commander decides to run when critics say he will face little competition after what rights groups describe as an unprecedented crackdown on opponents and dissidents.  low turnout was a worry in 2014, when sisi won by a landslide, as a popular figure who had overthrown president mohamed mursi of the muslim brotherhood after mass protests the previous year.  the rise in prices changed things,  said ayman, a cairo bookstore owner.  we hoped for good things from president sisi ... he is a good man and i voted for him, but we are not feeling the progress, all i care about is giving my son a good life, a good home.  economic reforms have come at a fast pace. the imf deal called for broad adjustments to egypt s state subsidies to slash deficits as part of sisi s promise to revive an economy hit hard by unrest, protests and militant attacks in the last six years. backed by the imf and the world bank, sisi s government says the overhaul will lead to long term growth and the return of foreign investment. officials have adopted programs to provide the poor and vulnerable with cash and other protections.  still, fuel costs have doubled with two increases in subsidized prices. electricity prices are up and a new tax helped push inflation to more than 30 percent in july. that has now eased to 25 percent and is expected to fall further soon. but it has been a crushing struggle for some. hisham azz al arab, chairman of egypt s largest private bank cib, said those on middle and upper incomes were the most affected by the economic reforms, but it would take time for their impact to balance out for those families.  we saw that clearly in their behavior of spending, it started to change,  he told cnbc.  for the middle and upper class it is a matter of time before income and productivity start to catch up to pre reform levels.   a 2016 world bank survey found the middle class represented around 10 percent of the country s population of about 90 million just before the arab spring protests. middle class activists were among the leaders of the 2011 uprising.  for professionals like karim, a cairo small business owner, it was a stark adjustment. monthly food bills went from 1,200 pounds ($67) to 3,200 pounds ($179). that meant for the first time bargain hunting for food, giving up luxury goods, and using the car less to cut back on fuel spending. it also meant paying employees more to keep them, while at the same time making sacrifices to keep his children in school.  the middle class has only two options, fall into the lower class, which is hard for them to do, or get more enterprising,  he said.  everyone is trying to show they are still in the middle class, people want to tell themselves that.  for others, maintaining a middle class lifestyle has meant dipping into savings and giving up restaurants or even turning to relatives for help with the cost of family holidays.     it s extinct,  said islam askar, a contracting company owner, of the country s middle class.  there isn t a household in egypt that hasn t been hit by the decrease in the pound and the rise in the prices.  economists say middle class erosion had been reflected in figures for car sales, the weakness in some consumer stocks and in outbound tourism. for some, like mahmoud al abadaly, hunting for bargains among the crash damaged vehicles at a second hand car shop, politics comes second to cash considerations. a car normally worth 300,000 pounds ($17,000) can be fixed up and had for half that price, he said.  when a car has been in an accident, its price drops,  he said.  everyone is trying to do this now because they need to save.      but egypt s inflation outlook is already improving a year after the float, falling to 26 percent in november. finance minister amr el garhy said that would fall to around 14 percent by august next year. what impact a year of austerity will have on sisi s popularity is unclear. he has yet to announce his intentions, though supporters have already started a petition campaign for him to run for a second term. for his hardcore backers, it is time to rally behind him despite hard times.  i will be for sisi again for the presidency even with inflation, rising prices and the poor state of the economy,  said ali abou al saoud, a sales representative. but some of the president s high profile backers have turned against him, partly over the economy. turnout may be key for credibility, analysts say, as the government rebrands egypt as a more stable bet for foreign investment after years of unrest. in 2014, turnout was about 47 percent, less than sisi had called for. at the time, sisi was idolized by many, although his support base has since slipped, critics say. however, protests are now restricted by law and secular activists have been rounded up. other egyptians say political fatigue has set in.  there is still a strong sense of wanting to maintain and enjoy the relative security,  said ziad bahaa eldin, a deputy former prime minister who now works as an economist.  people are suffering from inflation but they want stability.

" zimbabwe s president robert mugabe said on saturday he may make changes to his cabinet next week, at a time of rising tensions within his ruling party over who will eventually takeover from him. mugabe told a meeting of the ruling zanu pf youth wing in harare that it was time to review the performance of his cabinet ministers.  the last cabinet reshuffle was in september 2015 when mugabe was removing allies of his former deputy joice mujuru, whom he fired in december 2014 over accusations that she was plotting to topple him. she denied the allegations.  next week there might be some changes in government. should we remain with the same team or we make changes or even discard some. so that exercise i will be doing it and early next week you will get the results,  mugabe told a meeting of his zanu pf youth wing. vice president emmerson mnangagwa, a frontrunner to take over from mugabe, said on thursday he had been poisoned in august when he fell ill and was airlifted to south africa, which earned him a public rebuke from first lady grace mugabe. zanu pf is divided into two camps, one supporting mnangagwa to succeed mugabe and another rallying behind grace. mugabe also castigated his senior party officials for fighting in public, saying this would weaken zanu pf and embolden the opposition ahead of elections next year.  and the public insults, its a shame. a shame even to our legend because our party was not built on that basis. a party which has learnt that if we are divided then we become the food of vultures outside,  mugabe said.

" the chairman of the senate foreign relations committee on tuesday sharply questioned u.s. plans to sell f 16 fighter jets to pakistan, questioning pakistani actions he described as threatening u.s. troops as they try to stabilize afghanistan. “they continue to support the taliban, the haqqani network and give safe haven to al qaeda,” republican senator bob corker said to secretary of state john kerry, who was testifying to the committee about the state department’s annual budget request. the u.s. government said on feb. 12 it had approved the sale to pakistan of up to eight f 16 fighter jets built by lockheed martin corp, radar and other equipment in a deal valued at $699 million. lawmakers have 30 days to block the sale and corker has made clear he has doubts about it. kerry responded that the issue is complicated and said pakistan also has been an ally. “i understand your reservations about it but their military has been deeply engaged in the fight against terrorism,” he said.

" the trump administration on thursday issued a final rule that will shorten the obamacare enrollment period and give insurers more of what they say they need in the individual insurance market, likely making it harder for some consumers to purchase insurance, healthcare experts said.  it could also raise out of pocket medical expenses, the experts said, because it gives insurers more flexibility in determining the value of their coverage. the rule, which takes effect later this year, comes as president donald trump and republicans in congress have renewed efforts to repeal and replace the affordable care act, commonly known as obamacare, after an effort to pass a bill in the u.s. house of representatives failed last month.  issued by a division of the u.s. department of health and human services and first proposed in february, the rule aims to aid insurers, who have lost hundreds of millions of dollars in the individual insurance markets set up by obamacare. several major insurers, including humana inc and aetna inc, have announced plans to exit some state exchanges in 2018.  insurers welcomed the rule but said there is still too much uncertainty in the market. on wednesday, trump told the wall street journal that he may withhold obamacare payments to insurers that amount to about $7 billion a year to force democrats back to the negotiating table.  marilyn tavenner, president and chief executive of america’s health insurance plans, said in a statement that funding for the payments must continue uninterrupted. otherwise, she said premiums will rise 20 percent across the market and more insurers would drop out of the exchanges.   the changes under thursday’s final rule include a shortened open enrollment period for obamacare plans. they also make it harder for people to enroll outside that period, which is allowed under certain circumstances such as a pregnancy or a move.  the rule could also allow insurers to collect unpaid premium payments and make it tougher for people to move in and out of insurance plans, according to healthcare industry experts.  insurers say “gaming the system” has created an unprofitable mix of healthy and sick customers. the rule also gives states broader authority by removing the federal government’s role in overseeing doctor and hospital networks included in insurance plans. republicans have said any healthcare reform or overhaul must give states more flexibility. the affordable care act enabled 20 million americans to gain insurance, mostly through the individual insurance markets set up by the law or through an expansion of medicaid, the government health insurance program for the poor and disabled.

" within minutes of jeb bush dropping out of the presidential race saturday night, some of his donors were preparing to throw their financial support behind marco rubio, who has emerged as the strongest candidate among the establishment wing of the party. “jeb’s network is already naturally migrating to marco,” said gaylord hughey, a top bush fundraiser from texas, echoing what four other top donors told reuters. “it’s the clear path.” “it’s a stampede,” added another donor, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he wanted to give bush some time after dropping out before he went public with his support of rubio, the u.s. senator from florida. three other bush donors, who declined to be named, also said they now planned to support rubio.   although he has failed to win any of the first three nominating contests, rubio is considered by many political strategists as the best positioned to challenge frontrunner donald trump, a billionaire political outsider, and senator ted cruz of texas, who has campaigned on an anti washington message. the likelihood that some of bush’s deep pocketed donors will back rubio comes at an opportune time for his candidacy, as he heads into a series of contests in march that will be crucial for building momentum. brian ballard, who raised money for bush last year but switched allegiances last summer to rubio, said: “it’s flooding tonight. ninety five percent of jeb’s money is going to end up with marco.”  rubio had only $5 million in cash on hand at the end of january, federal campaign finance reports released saturday night show, a slim buffer by modern campaign standards.  conservative solutions, a political spending group that supports his campaign, had $5.6 million on hand at the end of january, but spent an additional $9.3 million on advertising in the first 19 days of february.  by contrast, right to rise, bush’s political spending group,  had $24.5 million on hand at the end of january but spent $6.6 million of that in february on ads. and his network of donors have proven their financial might, helping bush at one point to amass a war chest of $150 million. even before bush dropped out, some donors privately complained about the missteps of the campaign, expressing concern about the strength of trump’s candidacy and bush’s lackluster debate performances.  in january, a dozen top bush donors interviewed by reuters said they were angry that bush was using their money to lob attack ads at rubio, damaging the candidate they thought had the best chance to win.  they also said they had privately signaled to the rubio campaign that they would support him once bush dropped out. but they wouldn’t go public at the time because they feared displeasing the bush dynasty.       in addition to the bush money, rubio is expected to reap the support of the billionaire industrialist koch brothers and their donor network, which is expected to spend $400 million in the presidential race, according to several network donors and koch political organization officials.  the koch brothers are also in the midst of planning efforts to undercut trump’s candidacy, network officials and members said at a recent private retreat in california. their focus group research has shown that when voters learn more about how trump’s past business behavior has hurt ordinary people, they sour on him, according to the sources, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.

" the fbi will recommend to the justice department that no charges be filed over hillary clinton’s use of a private email server while secretary of state, agency director james comey said on tuesday, lifting a cloud of uncertainty looming over her white house campaign. the agency found evidence of “extremely careless” handling of emails by clinton, and that at least 110 emails contained classified information at the time they were sent, said comey, announcing the result of a yearlong investigation. but the fbi concluded that “no reasonable prosecutor” would bring charges against clinton, he said. “although the department of justice makes final decisions on matters like this, we are expressing to justice our view that no charges are appropriate in this case,” comey told reporters in washington. his recommendation will likely stand. the country’s top prosecutor, u.s. attorney general loretta lynch, said on friday she will accept the recommendations of career prosecutors and the fbi director on whether to charge clinton for mishandling emails.  the fbi probe has dogged the presumptive democratic presidential nominee’s campaign for the past year and has contributed to her low poll ratings on honesty and trustworthiness. republicans pointed to the controversy as evidence that clinton considered herself above the law. donald trump, clinton’s republican rival for the nov. 8 election, has hammered her on the issue, saying the investigation should disqualify clinton from being president. on tuesday, he said the fbi decision was unfair. “the system is rigged,” he said on twitter. “as usual, bad judgment.” the fbi has been investigating whether clinton broke the law as result of a personal email server kept in her chappaqua, new york, home while she was secretary of state from 2009 to 2013. one of the questions is whether she mishandled classified information on the server. clinton has repeatedly said she never sent or received classified information on her private server. she had a  voluntary 3 1/2 hour interview with the federal bureau of investigation on saturday in washington. comey said, however, there was “evidence of potential violations of the statutes regarding the handling of classified information.”  but he said the fbi did not find that clinton or her colleagues intended to violate the law, and there was no “intentional misconduct” by her lawyers who sorted her emails. he said her staff should have known the server was in an improper place for her emails. comey also said there was no evidence that anyone had hacked clinton’s communications, although it was possible. republican lawmakers have called for an independent investigation, saying they do not trust the justice department to handle the inquiry with impartiality. republican criticism increased after clinton’s husband, former president bill clinton, met privately with lynch last week. lynch later said she regretted the meeting and the two did not discuss the investigation.

" conservative billionaire sebastian pinera said he would court centrist s on monday in a bid to regain ground in chile s presidential election after a surprise surge by leftists in sunday s first round vote. pinera faces a tight dec. 17 runoff against center left alejandro guillier and will also likely have to deal with opposition to his promised tax breaks in the next left leaning congress if he triumphs. a former president who ran chile between 2010 and 2014, pinera placed first with more than 36 percent of the vote, but his two main left leaning rivals made a stronger than expected showing, garnering a combined 43 percent between them. and after congressional elections that also took place on sunday, left of center lawmakers will outnumber pinera s chile vamos voting bloc in congress, complicating his plans to cut the corporate tax rate and slash red tape in the top copper exporter. markets that had priced in a new four year term for pinera sank on monday. chile s stock index took its biggest daily dive in six years and the peso currency suffered its sharpest depreciation since 2013.  it s going to be a tight and hard fought election,  pinera told foreign media on monday in capital santiago.  to boost his chances of winning, pinera said he would tap some of the more popular lawmakers elect in his bloc to help guide his campaign.  we re going to appeal to the center, to the kind of people who want moderation,  said pinera.  we re going to listen with humility to what the majority of chileans want.  on monday night, the center left christian democratic party endorsed guillier  without conditions.  its presidential candidate, carolina goic, who was the most moderate of those running to pinera s left, garnered about 2 percent of the vote in sunday s contest. according to the vote tally, many chileans want change. a new leftist grouping, frente amplio, which has criticized chile s model of free market provision of services and promised to tax mining companies and the  super rich , performed much better than expected. the bloc s presidential candidate, beatriz sanchez, secured 20 percent of votes in the field of eight, double the support predicted by pollster cep. the block won its first senate seat and around 20 seats in the lower house of congress. no single bloc will control congress. a pinera victory in december was no longer a sure thing, said election forecaster and political scientist kenneth bunker.  it s all up in the air right now,  bunker said.  we were just dumbfounded when the results started to come in.  in another bad sign for pinera, chileans went to polls in bigger numbers than expected on sunday. analysts say a low voter turnout favors pinera because his supporters tend to be better at showing up to vote. chile, a country of 17 million people with a $250 billion economy, has been one of latin america s most business friendly and stable nations since its transition to democracy in 1990. its economy slowed, however, to an average growth rate of 1.8 percent during outgoing president michelle bachelet s term, with lower copper prices dragging on government revenue. guillier has promised to deepen bachelet s policies, from expanded access to free university education to protections for striking unions, without departing from chile s free market economic model. he has a tricky task ahead to attract the support of chile s wide ranging left of center voters, in part because he is seen by many as a continuation of bachelet s unpopular government. having slammed pinera as a  step backward  for chile, sanchez, a 46 year old former radio journalist, could rally her  supporters to vote for guillier, but likely in exchange for policy concessions.  if mr guillier wants us to vote for him, he s going to have to give in to beatriz s proposals,  sanchez supporter and salesman hector mino said. he cited sanchez  plan to wipe out student debt and overhaul the public private pension system to ensure bigger payouts as possible offerings. but a too sharp left turn could push more centrist s to pinera. as left leaning blocs weighed possible alliances, far right jose antonio kast threw his weight behind pinera. kast won nearly 8 percent of votes and urged the chileans who cast them to vote for pinera in the runoff.  we re not going to demand anything in return,  said kast, who defended deceased chilean dictator augusto pinochet during the campaign.

" israel shot down a syrian spy drone over the golan heights on saturday, the israeli military said. the drone was downed with a patriot interceptor missile over the golan demilitarized zone that has separated israeli and syrian forces since the ceasefire deal that followed their 1973 war. the military initially told reuters the uav was russian manufactured but offered no evidence. a military source later said it was unclear whether the uav was indeed russian made.   it was a reconnaissance uav (unmanned aerial vehicle) and not an attack uav and we are checking whether there is any connection to iran and hezbollah,  military spokesman, lieutenant colonel jonathan conricus, told reuters.  israeli defense minister avigdor lieberman said israel viewed the incident gravely and would respond to any provocation.   we hold the syrian regime responsible for any firing or breach of sovereignty and call on it to hold back all players active in its territory,  lieberman said in a statement. russia intervened in the civil war on behalf of syrian president bashar al assad in 2015, joining a de facto alliance with iranian forces, lebanese hezbollah and other shi ite muslim militias helping damascus beat back islamic state and other sunni muslim insurgent groups. israel fears an eventual assad victory could leave iran with a permanent garrison in syria, extending a threat posed from neighboring lebanon by the iranian backed hezbollah and has been lobbying russia and the united states for reassurances that iranian and hezbollah forces will not be allowed to deploy near its border or set up bases within syria.   we will not allow the shi ite axis to establish syria as its forefront base,  lieberman said. the golan, which israel captured from syria in the 1967 conflict, has seen spillover violence from the syrian civil war. israel has at times fired to foil what it deemed deliberate cross border attacks and has struck suspected hezbollah arms shipments around 100 times in syria during the civil war. for its part, russia has set up a military hotline to prevent warplanes or anti aircraft units clashing accidentally over syria.

" dozens of mortar bombs landed on the last major rebel stronghold near the syrian capital damascus on wednesday, a war monitor and a witness said on wednesday, despite a 48 hour truce proposed by russia to coincide with the start of peace talks in geneva. after a relatively calm morning, shelling picked up later in the day, accompanied by ground attempts to storm the besieged enclave, a witness in the eastern ghouta area told reuters. the syrian army stepped up bombardment two weeks ago in an effort to recapture eastern ghouta, a rebel held pocket of densely populated agricultural land on the outskirts of the capital under siege since 2012. scores of people have been killed in air strikes during the offensive, and residents say they are on the verge of starvation after the siege was tightened. russia had proposed a ceasefire on monday in the besieged area for nov. 28 29. u.n. syria envoy staffan de mistura later said russia had told him that the syrian government had accepted the idea, but  we have to see if it happens . the syrian observatory for human rights said at least one person was killed when dozens of mortars crashed into eastern ghouta on wednesday. eastern ghouta is one of several  de escalation  zones across western syria where russia has brokered ceasefire deals between rebels and president bashar al assad s government. but fighting has continued there. on tuesday, shelling killed three people and injured 15, but was less intense than in previous days, the observatory said. it had reported intense bombardment that killed 41 people over two days from sunday to monday.  a two day truce is not nearly enough for civilians facing grave violations of international law   including bombardment and besiegement   but it is a window of opportunity to save the lives of the most desperately in need of treatment,  said thomas garofalo, international rescue committee s middle east public affairs director, in a statement on wednesday. the syrian delegation arrived in geneva to participate in the eighth round of united nation sponsored peace talks. it delayed its departure for one day after the opposition repeated its demand that syrian president bashar al assad step down. nasr hariri, head of the opposition delegation, told a geneva news conference on monday night that he is aiming for assad s removal as a result of negotiations. the government delegation will be headed by syria s u.n. ambassador and chief negotiator bashar al ja afari, state run news agency sana said. a breakthrough in the talks is seen as unlikely as assad and his allies push for total military victory in syria s civil war, now in its seventh year, and his opponents stick by their demand he leaves power.

" japan is hammering out plans to show u.s. president donald trump its firms are ready to create u.s. jobs, according to a document whose contents were revealed to reuters, as prime minister shinzo abe prepares for a summit where automotive trade will be high on the agenda. abe will visit washington on feb. 10 for the talks at which  trump is expected to seek quick progress toward a two way trade deal.  an early draft of the document, called “u.s. japan growth and employment initiative”, listed five areas including  infrastructure. the document, which was read to reuters, did not mention automotive trade, which trump has targeted as “unfair” in an echo of complaints by washington decades ago. the document left blanks for the numbers of jobs to be created and the scope of investment but a government source said several hundred thousand jobs could result. it also referred to the idea of buying dollar denominated “infrastructure bonds”, a proposal that has been floated as a way japan could take part in trump’s promised upgrade of u.s. infrastructure.  japanese officials said they were still trying to assess just what trump wants from japan. in addition to singling out cars, he has also lumped japan with china and mexico as big contributors to america’s trade deficit. however, japan’s share of the u.s. global trade gap has shrunk to 9 percent from more than half in the early 1990s. automobiles and car parts account for about three fourths of the overall u.s. japan trade gap, making it an easy target. in a phone call with abe on saturday, trump reiterated his pledge to create jobs in the united states and asked that the japanese auto industry contribute, the nikkei business daily reported, quoting unidentified japanese government officials. abe is expected to meet toyoto motor corp ceo akio toyoda this week, possibly on friday. “mr. trump has made a promise to ‘buy american, hire american’,” said one former japanese diplomat. “symbolically, autos are a very big player.” the renewed focus on the automotive trade has some japanese officials and media reminiscing   and not happily   about heated u.s. japan auto talks more than 20 years ago. a last minute deal in june 1995 averted u.s. tariffs on japanese luxury cars when japan’s automakers crafted “voluntary plans” to boost purchases of american auto parts and expand u.s. production. that allowed the japanese government to maintain its opposition to setting official numerical trade targets while letting u.s. negotiators also claim a win. yoshihiro sakamoto, the top japanese trade bureaucrat in those talks two decades ago, said such plans   drafted behind the scenes by the auto industry and trade ministry   could be a model for addressing the situation now. some experts pointed out, however, the ministry’s clout had waned since those days. “what america wants is investment,” sakamoto told reuters. toyota has come under fire from trump for plans, announced in 2015, to shift production of its corolla sedan from canada to mexico. earlier this month, japan’s top automaker said it would invest $10 billion in the united states over the next five years, the same as the previous five years. on monday, honda motor co ltd and general motors co said they would jointly produce pollution free hydrogen fuel cell power systems in the united states from around 2020. the companies said they would invest $85 million to add a production line at a gm battery plant in brownstown, michigan, and create 100 jobs. boosting output in the united states, however, could force japanese car makers to make tough decisions about reducing production   and jobs   back home. central japan railway company, or jr tokai, has given the government estimates of how many jobs would be created by proposed high speed shinkansen railways in california and texas and a high tech “maglev” railway along the u.s. east coast, a jr tokai spokeswoman said. she declined to release the figures. abe, who is close to jr tokai chairman emeritus yoshiyuki kasai, has touted maglev or magnetic levitation as a “dream technology” that could link new york and washington in under an hour.

" if mike pence had any doubts about what life would be like on the 2016 republican presidential ticket with donald trump, the past week will have erased them: he is the damage control guy. the indiana governor who swore off political mudslinging years ago heard trump call democratic rival hillary clinton “the devil” and watched him fan the flames of a feud with the parents of a muslim soldier who died saving u.s. troops in iraq. unlike many vice presidential running mates, the mild mannered pence was not tapped as the attack dog in the nov. 8  presidential election. trump has that part down pat. pence’s job is harder: softening trump’s rough edges and limiting the fallout from what many republicans see as the nominee’s self inflicted wounds. a week ago, for example, pence rowed back on trump’s blacklist of some media outlets, saying the campaign is discussing changing course. last sunday, as trump’s dispute with the parents of slain u.s. army captain humayun khan boiled over, pence issued a statement praising the soldier as an “american hero” and saying that his family “should be cherished by every american.”     on wednesday, pence offered his own endorsement to house of representatives speaker paul ryan, the top u.s. elected republican, after trump infuriated many party leaders by declining to endorse ryan in his re election bid. pence, who swore off negative campaigning after losing a vituperative congressional race in 1990, eschews name calling. trump, by contrast, delights in using monikers such as “crooked hillary” and “the devil” to describe clinton. trump has made clear he values pence, telling a rally on thursday in portland, maine, that he and his running mate have a “great relationship.” but pence must walk a fine line. even as he defuses trump’s verbal bombs, pence must be careful to show he knows who is boss. he also has to stick to his own principles while not appearing to be trying to undermine the man who chose him as his no. 2. should trump win, pence, a former congressman, could serve as a conduit to the u.s. congress. but if trump loses, pence could emerge as a possible white house contender for 2020. republican strategist charlie black said pence has shown some political deftness. “he should have expected he would do some of this and provide more of the even tempered, articulate, measured responses,” black said. but republican strategist ryan williams said pence is in an “impossible spot” and said that trump’s missteps could cast a shadow over his running mate’s political future.     “mike pence is a good republican but unfortunately he will be associated with the controversies that have ensnared the trump pence ticket and will be tied to whatever the consequences of this election are,”  williams said.     trump’s off the cuff insults and controversial proposals, such as a temporary ban on muslims entering the united states and a plan to build a wall along the mexican border to keep illegal immigrants out, have made many in the party establishment uneasy. the republican nominee’s feud with the khan family made for an awkward moment for pence at a campaign event in carson city, nevada. a military mother asked pence how could he tolerate trump’s disrespect for the armed forces, which prompted boos. pence admonished the crowd to tone it down. “folks, that’s what freedom looks like and that’s what freedom sounds like,” he said before calling humayun khan an american hero. pence was asked on thursday by an 11 year old boy at a north carolina rally if his role was “softening up” trump’s policies and words. pence replied that he and trump were “shoulder to shoulder” in the campaign. christopher devine, co author of the book “the vp advantage” and an assistant political science professor at the university of dayton in ohio, said that if trump loses the november election, pence may try to position himself as a conservative bridge between trump supporters and traditional republicans. that may be an added reason for pence’s cautious approach. “he has to be very careful about how he handles the defense of donald trump,” devine said.

" china’s state news agency xinhua described u.s. president donald trump’s decision to withdraw from the paris climate accord as a “global setback” and rejected trump’s claim that it would lead to many more jobs in america. in a commentary published on friday, xinhua suggested that no one country was now likely take up leadership of global efforts to fight climate change. china overtook the united states as the world’s biggest emitter of greenhouse gases in 2007 but analysts see the u.s. withdrawal as an opportunity for china to burnish its image as a global leader. “trump’s decision to ditch the paris deal will leave a fairly big shoe for a single country to fill,” xinhua said, adding that major players such as china, the european union and india had reiterated their willingness to step up efforts. leaving the 2015 paris accord would hardly translate into a substantial increase in new jobs as the fossil fuel industries were highly automated, xinhua said. noting that trump said he had had “extensive discussions” with people on both sides of the climate debate, it said: “one can only assume that trump has very good reasons to leave the paris agreement, and that he knows the implications of u.s. retreat from the landmark deal”. trump, tapping into the “america first” message he used when he was elected president last year, said the paris accord would undermine the u.s. economy, cost u.s. jobs, weaken american national sovereignty and put the country at a permanent disadvantage to other countries such as china. the global times, an influential state run tabloid, said in an editorial published on thursday before trump’s announcement that china was not interested in discussions about the leadership of fighting climate change and would focus on its own promises to reduce emissions. it called the withdrawal “reckless” and would “waste  increasingly finite u.s. diplomatic resources.” “there are indeed some underprivileged people in the u.s, but their troubles are mainly caused by bad internal governance. seeking external reasons for domestic woes is by no means what the world’s largest economy should do,” it said.

" lebanon s top court on friday sentenced habib shartouni to death for the 1982 assassination of president elect bashir gemayel, an event that was a turning point in lebanon s 15 year civil war.  shartouni, a member of the syrian socialist nationalist party (ssnp), admitted his part in the bombing in the 1980s and was tried in absentia after escaping from prison in 1990 following eight years in detention.  he was quoted in an interview in lebanon s al akhbar newspaper on thursday saying the timing of the trial was political and that he had lived in syria between 1994 and 2004. he did not reveal his present location.  gemayel was killed less than a month after he was elected president and soon after he agreed to start discussing diplomatic ties with israel. his assassination occurred during israel s 1982 invasion of lebanon, one of the bloodiest episodes in the civil war.  his death in a bombing that killed 32 other people on sept. 14, 1982, still resonates among many lebanese and triggered the massacre of palestinians in beirut s sabra and chatila refugee camps.  supporters of both shartouni and gemayel have protested outside the court during the hearings.  gemayel was head of the lebanese forces christian militia, locked in conflict with leftist, muslim and palestinian factions, and his candidacy was backed by israel.  its invasion was aimed at driving from lebanon the palestine liberation organisation (plo), as well as the syrian army, which had entered in 1976 as part of a peace deal.  after his assassination, israel entered the capital beirut and allowed gemayel s militia, the lebanese forces, to access the sabra and chatila palestinian refugee camps, where their  fighters killed hundreds of civilian refugees.  gemayel s family is still one of the most important in lebanese politics, heading the kataeb party that was founded by his father. the lebanese forces militia later became a different political party headed by one of its commanders, samir geagea.

" u.s. president donald trump’s communications director is leaving the job, the white house said on tuesday, as the president considers wider staff changes to try to contain political damage from investigations into russia and his presidential campaign.  mike dubke confirmed reports he had resigned, saying in a statement, “it has been my great honor to serve president trump and this administration.” dubke, who had been in the job just three months, gave no reason for leaving. trump, who returned to washington on saturday after a nine day trip to the middle east and europe, has been expected to shake up staff to tackle the firestorm over investigations into alleged russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election and communication between russia and trump’s campaign and transition team.  trump plans to bring in new aides to the white house, adding experienced political professionals including a former campaign manager, according to administration officials and people close to the president. dubke, who was joined the white house in march to head the office that runs press and other public relations issues, oversees the white house’s message strategy while spokesman sean spicer, a more high profile figure, handles daily media briefings.  the republican president came home to face more questions on russia after media reports about communications during and after the campaign between his son in law and close adviser, jared kushner, and russia’s ambassador to washington. spicer was asked on tuesday whether trump knew about reported efforts by kushner in december to set up a back channel for communications with russia. “what your question assumes is a lot of facts that are not substantiated by anything but anonymous sources that are so far being leaked out,” he told a news briefing. asked about a possible staff shake up, spicer said: “i think the president is very pleased with his team and he has a robust agenda.”  dubke resigned just before trump left on his foreign trip but will stay on until a transition is concluded, reince priebus, the white house chief of staff, said.        other potential staff changes could be in the works, according to axios news, which first reported dubke’s departure, including fewer on camera news briefings by spicer, the white house press secretary.  trump also will take more questions directly from the media, axios reported.  “ultimately the best messenger is the president himself,” spicer said on tuesday. senior adviser kellyanne conway told fox news the white house will continue to bring in cabinet secretaries and other top officials to handle news briefings on topics in their patch. conway also dismissed persistent speculation that spicer, who has been pilloried on tv comedy shows since trump took office on jan. 20, was on his way out.  controversy over the russia issue deepened after trump fired fbi director james comey earlier this month, leading to allegations by critics that the president sought to hamper the agency’s investigation of the matter. moscow has denied u.s. intelligence agencies’ conclusion that it meddled in the campaign to try to tilt the election in trump’s favor. the president has denied any collusion, repeatedly denouncing the probes by a special counsel at the justice department, the fbi and several congressional panels as a democrat backed effort to explain hillary clinton’s upset defeat in the white house race. congressional investigations into the russia issue have expanded to include trump’s personal attorney, michael cohen, abc news reported on tuesday. cohen confirmed he had been asked to provide information and testimony to investigators in the u.s. house of representatives and the senate but said he declined because “the request was poorly phrased, overly broad and not capable of being answered,” abc reported.  cohen did not respond to reuters’ request to comment. the white house declined to comment, saying cohen is not an employee of the administration. however, former white house national security adviser michael flynn, who resigned after failing to properly disclose his own contacts with russian officials, told the senate intelligence committee he will begin turning over some documents subpoenaed by the panel, a government source familiar with the matter told reuters.

" scientists must confront climate change deniers and speak up if u.s. president elect donald trump tries to sideline climate research, interior secretary sally jewell is due to say on wednesday. “if you see science being ignored or compromised, speak up,” jewell will tell a meeting of earth and space scientists in san francisco, according to a draft of the speech seen by reuters. trump has called climate change a hoax and sought to fill his cabinet with oil industry allies like texas governor rick perry, the energy department nominee.  last week, the trump team asked the u.s. department of energy to supply names of officials who took part in international climate talks   a request that the agency has rejected. the scientific fact of climate change cannot be ignored no matter who is in the white house, jewell will say. and she will urge climate experts to publicly defend their work. “think about where to raise your voice and then do it,” jewell will tell a meeting of the american geophysical union (agu)   a global association of researchers. “the american people must be able to trust science.” as president barack obama’s top steward for public lands, jewell has helped manage terrain that holds vast reserves of oil, gas and coal. but over nearly four years in office, jewell has also warned that burning fossil fuels will irreparably harm the planet. jewell will say that national historic sites that she now manages   like the 17th century colonial outpost, jamestown   could eventually be swallowed by rising seas. policymakers must confront climate change realities, jewell said. christine mcentee, head of the agu, said her members were concerned that the trump administration might not value scientific discovery and rigor. developments at the energy department were particularly alarming, she said, but climate researchers were prepared to defend their methods and discoveries.  “we listen to what science is telling us,” she said. “and we’ll fight to work without fear of intimidation or retribution.” ",0
" french president emmanuel macron held hastily scheduled talks in riyadh on thursday with saudi crown prince mohammed bin salman amid rising tensions between saudi arabia and iran, notably over lebanon and yemen. macron, who flew in from a visit to the united arab emirates, had earlier declined to discuss a wave of high level arrests for corruption in saudi arabia, but said it was vital to work with the kingdom for the stability of the region. the first face to face talks between the two men focused on regional questions, in particular yemen and lebanon, and  ensuring the preservation of stability in the region , the french presidency said in a statement after the meeting. two top lebanese government officials said on thursday that riyadh was holding lebanon s saad al hariri captive and a third told reuters that the saudi authorities had ordered hariri to resign while he was in riyadh last weekend, and put him under house arrest. saudi arabia has denied that he is under house arrest, but hariri himself has not denied that his movements are being restricted. france has close ties with lebanon, a former colony, and with hariri, who has a home in france after spending several years in the country. macron said at an earlier news conference in dubai there had been informal contacts with hariri, but no request to transfer him to france.   they discussed the situation in lebanon following the resignation of prime minister hariri,  the french presidency said.  president macron reiterated the importance france attaches to lebanon s stability, security, sovereignty and integrity.  the statement made no mention on whether macron had spoken with or seen hariri while in riyadh. in recent years, france has been able to nurture new links with the sunni ruled gulf arab states due to its tough stance on iran in nuclear negotiations, and the broad similarity of their policies on conflicts across the middle east. however, the 32 year old saudi crown prince has emphasized closer ties with u.s. president donald trump at a time when macron has in turn sought to improve relations with iran, saudi arabia s shi ite rival for regional influence. macron has said he will travel to iran in 2018, potentially becoming the first french president to travel there since 1971.  in yemen, the saudi led military coalition fighting the houthi movement said on monday it had closed all air, land and sea ports to stem the flow of arms to the houthis from iran. the united nations said the move risked causing  the largest famine the world has seen for many decades, with millions of victims . the french presidency said macron underlined his concerns regarding the humanitarian situation. on iran, macron repeated earlier in dubai that he wanted to keep the landmark 2015 nuclear deal, which trump has challenged.  but he said he was  very concerned  by iran s ballistic missile program, mentioning a missile fired from yemen and intercepted by saudi arabia on saturday, and raised the prospect of possible sanctions with regard to those activities.  there are extremely strong concerns about iran. there are negotiations we need to start on iran s ballistic missiles,  he said.  like what was done in 2015 for the nuclear activities, it s necessary to put a framework in place for iran s ballistic activities and open a process, with sanctions if needed, of negotiation that would enable (that).  iran has denied providing ballistic missiles to yemeni houthi rebels and says its missile program is purely defensive and should not be linked to the nuclear deal. macron reaffirmed his intention to go to iran as part of efforts to talk to all the actors in the region, but warned about decisions that could destabilize the region further.   we need to have a truthful dialogue,  he said.  it s not about showing any naivety toward iran, it is about standing beside our allies, in particular the united arab emirates, but it is also about not having a diehard policy that could create imbalances or even conflicts in the region.

" an oklahoma bill that could revoke the license of any doctor who performs an abortion may soon head to the governor, with opponents saying the measure in unconstitutional and promising a legal battle against the cash strapped state if it is approved. in the republican dominated legislature, the state’s house of representatives overwhelmingly approved a senate bill late on thursday. governor mary fallin, a republican, has not yet indicated whether she will sign it. the senate needs to approve minor changes to the bill before it can go to the governor, lawmakers said. under the bill, doctors who perform abortions would risk losing their medical licenses. exemptions would be given for those who perform the procedure for reasons including protecting the mother or removing a miscarried fetus. “this is our proper function, to protect life,” said senator nathan dahm, the republican who authored the bill. a handful of representatives argued against the bill, saying it violated the constitution by prohibiting a doctor from performing a medical procedure that was legal under law. “oklahoma politicians have made it their mission year after year to restrict women’s access vital health care services, yet this total ban on abortion is a new low,” said amanda allen, senior state legislative counsel at the center for reproductive rights. the lobbying group and several other abortion rights organizations have promised court challenges if the bill is enacted.  supporters of the bill said it will help protect the sanctity of life. “if we take care of morality,” bill supporter david brumbaugh, a republican, said during deliberations, “god will take care of the economy.” ",0
" president elect donald trump’s national security transition has been more chaotic than others in recent memory, with important positions unfilled and many of his people less able, or willing, to engage on substance, u.s. officials said. the uncertainties surrounding trump’s personnel, policies, and rise to power have rattled many of america’s allies, including japan, germany and britain, at a time when china is more assertive, russia more aggressive, terrorism more diffuse, the middle east still unstable and north korea nuclear armed and unpredictable, said u.s. and foreign diplomats. disruption and uncertainty can provide strategic advantages, mark lagon and ross harrison of georgetown university wrote in foreign policy magazine. “but what is seriously in doubt is whether trump’s disruption will be strategic or beneficial to u.s. foreign policy interests. even before getting elected, he acted like a missile without a guidance system.” top trump officials, however, described the transition as having gone smoothly, including on national security. republican trump’s camp announced on thursday it had asked more than 50 of democrat obama’s appointees to stay on.  however, at least three officials, a senior intelligence officer and two diplomats whose names are on a list of “requested political holdovers,” will depart. principal deputy director of national intelligence stephanie o’sullivan, under secretary of state catherine novelli and assistant secretary of state toria nuland appear on a jan. 17 partial list of people the transition wanted to remain after trump’s inauguration on friday. the two diplomats have told colleagues they are going, and o’sullivan is keeping her long standing plans to retire. a u.s. official said that nuland was never asked by the transition to stay on and was unaware of her name appearing on such a list. the state department declined comment. the trump transition and the office of the director of national intelligence did not immediately respond to a request for comment. it is not clearly whether the uncertainties extend to other parts of the government, but another senior official at a national security agency said trump’s effort was “much slower” than the 2001 bill clinton to george w. bush or the 2009 bush to barack obama handovers. “personnel appointments were far more advanced in both those cases,” said the official, who spoke on condition he not be identified. “in both cases, advance teams were working on substance.” during the 2008 2009 transition, the official said, incoming and outgoing officials had worked together on issues “in a very harmonious fashion.” “none of that is the case in this transition,” he added. he said that he had expected to have met by now with his likely replacement or others on the transition, but had not. “it’s not just me. everybody’s experience is like mine.” speaking to reporters on thursday, vice president elect michael pence said trump’s transition was being completed ahead of schedule and under budget. “our job is to be ready on day one. the american people can be confident that we will be.” trump spokesman sean spicer also told reporters that contact between the incoming and outgoing national security council staffs had been “tremendous.” “we’ve had reams of briefings,” he said. “that is one area where frankly they have been very, very aggressive and robust with both meeting with their counterparts and ensuring that the team is ready to go day one.”trump’s team did not respond to requests for further comment. three state department officials, though, called the transition there “a mess,” and said that until recently the trump team had little contact with department officials and read few if any of their briefing books.     that has left many career officials with misgivings about the incoming administration and the possibility that many foreign policy and national security veterans may be swept out. a dozen serving officials at four intelligence agencies said they are troubled by trump’s apparent disdain for their work; by his designated national security advisor michael flynn’s perceived bent for conspiracy theories and hostility toward some of his former colleagues; and by what some say is the incoming president’s disinterest in the briefings he has received. two officials with knowledge of those briefings said trump’s attention has wandered, he has asked few questions, has read few if any of the briefing books he’s been given – including the one on russian hacking of the 2016 election   and has requested few topical sessions, one of which was on north korea. secretary of state john kerry and his nominated replacement, rex tillerson, were to meet on thursday, but their schedules did not mesh, state department spokesman john kirby told reporters. one obama official, who has dealt with the trump transition team at the state department and spoke on condition of anonymity, said it appeared ‘totally disconnected’ from trump’s top echelon of advisers and from tillerson. tillerson’s nomination is not expected to get a senate foreign relations committee vote before monday at the earliest.

" the united states is reviewing military options, including new intermediate range cruise missile systems, in response to what it says is russia s ongoing violation of a cold war era pact banning such missiles, the state department said on friday. washington is prepared  to cease such research and development activities  if russia returns to compliance with the 1987 intermediate range nuclear forces treaty, state department spokeswoman heather nauert said in a statement. nauert also hinted at possible economic sanctions, saying the united states is  pursuing economic and military measures intended to induce the russian federation to return to compliance.  the warning was the trump administration s first response to u.s. charges first leveled in 2014 that russia had deployed a ground launched cruise missile that breaches the pact s ban on testing and fielding missiles with ranges of 500 5,500 kms (310 3,417 miles). u.s. officials have said the russian cruise missile is capable of carrying a nuclear warhead, and that moscow has refused to hold in depth discussions about the alleged breach. russia has denied it is violating the accord. in a statement issued before nauert s, the russian foreign ministry said it was ready for talks with the united states to try to preserve the treaty and would comply with its obligations if the united states did. in a statement marking the 30th anniversary of the treaty between the united states and the soviet union, the ministry said moscow considered  the language of ultimatums  and sanctions unacceptable. the u.s. allegation has further strained relations between moscow and washington. u.s. and russian officials are to discuss the issue at a meeting in coming weeks of the special commission that oversees the treaty, said a u.s. official, who requested anonymity. in the u.s. statement, nauert said the united states  remains firmly committed to the inf treaty and continues to seek the russian federation s return to compliance.   the administration firmly believes, however, that the united states cannot stand still while the russian federation continues to develop military systems in violation of the treaty,  she said.  the u.s. spokeswoman did not disclose the u.s. economic measures under consideration to secure russian compliance with the treaty but offered some details on the military measures. these, she said, involve a review of  military concepts and options  that include researching new ground launched conventional cruise missile systems.  this step will not violate our inf treaty obligations,  nauert said.  we are also prepared to cease such research and development activities if the russian federation returns to full and verifiable compliance with its inf treaty obligations.  her statement came a week after congress sent to president donald trump for signing a fiscal 2018 defense policy bill authorizing $58 million to develop a new inf busting road mobile conventional cruise missile and u.s. defenses against the russian weapon. the bill also called on trump to submit to congress a plan to impose u.s. sanctions on russians responsible for  ordering or facilitating non compliance  with the treaty. it was unclear when trump would sign the bill. the united states already has sanctions on russian entities and individuals, including people close to president vladimir putin, for moscow s 2014 seizure of crimea from ukraine and its alleged interference in the 2016 presidential election. moscow denies that it interfered in the election. a senior administration official, speaking recently on condition of anonymity, said the administration wanted to preserve the inf treaty rather than rip it up.  if we took the russian approach, we d all sort of say happy things about what a nice treaty we have and we would both go about violating it secretly,  said the senior administration official.  but that s not how we roll. it s because we like arms control when it s done properly.

"the ceo of outdoor clothing giant patagonia is burnishing her anti-republican bona fides again, this time saying she intends to pledge her entire company to the  resistance  of president donald trump.patagonia ceo rose marcario recently attacked president trump for his statements about rolling back president obama s unusually aggressive campaign of confiscating millions of acres of state lands and claiming them as  national monuments. we have to fight like hell to keep every inch of public land,  marcario said in a may article at huffpost.  i don t have a lot of faith in politics and politicians right now. in an effort to prevent citizens from retaking possession of their state lands, one of her immediate actions will be to sue the trump administration for its efforts to scale back obama s unprecedented land grab. a president does not have the authority to rescind a national monument,  marcario said in an april 26 statement after trump announced his national monuments order.  an attempt to change the boundaries ignores the review process of cultural and historical characteristics and the public input. in particular, the trump administration is preparing to revisit obama s order to create the bears ears national monument. in april, trump issued an executive order requiring the department of the interior to review obama s actions on national monuments. ordering interior secretary ray zinke to review obama s policies in april, president trump called obama s move an  egregious abuse of federal power. many state governments fully agree with trump s assessment and were furious when obama swooped in from washington and stole away millions of acres of land from state control to create new national monuments and parks.a poll of residents of utah, for instance, showed that 60 percent opposed obama s land grab, while only 33 percent supported it.this is far from the first time the sportswear company pledged its profits to political matters. last year, the california-based company spent over $1 million for a get-out-the-vote campaign to defeat donald trump and republicans.  breitbartpatagonia is an accredited and founding member of the fair labor association; its website is as much an educational tool about environmental and social responsibility filled with information on issues such as preservation of land in chile, labeling gmo products, and responsible sourcing as it is an online store. in a note launching the company s food division, patagonia provisions, company founder yvon chouinard restated the brand s central ethos:  we aim to make the best product, cause no unnecessary harm, and perhaps most important, inspire solutions to the environmental crisis. and yet, despite these aspirations, four years ago internal audits turned up multiple instances of human trafficking, forced labor, and exploitation in patagonia s supply chain, according to cara chacon, the company s director of social and environmental responsibility, and thuy nguyen, the manager of supply chain social responsibility and special programs.",1
" with a tight general election looming next year, mexican president enrique pena nieto faces a tough choice on whether to pursue a graft probe involving a prominent ally and brazilian construction firm odebrecht. mexico s top prosecutor, acting attorney general, alberto elias beltran, on friday fired the federal attorney general responsible for electoral crimes, adding fuel to a case that may complicate the president s efforts to shake off allegations of corruption in the run up to the july 2018 presidential vote. the dismissal of top electoral prosecutor, santiago nieto, came two days after he accused emilio lozoya, the former boss of state oil firm pemex, and a longtime ally of president pena nieto, in a newspaper interview of writing to him to ask to be declared innocent of funneling odebrecht cash to political campaigns. in brazil, odebrecht has admitted to paying bribes in several countries in latin america, including mexico.  president pena nieto s party, the institutional revolutionary party (pri), has been the dominant force of mexican politics for the best part of a century, but has long been a byword for corruption. mindful that the issue of corruption has become central to the 2018 election, the unpopular pri has overseen the arrest of various former state governors, but lozoya poses a more difficult challenge, given his proximity to the president.   if they investigate (lozoya) deeply, i think it would be the end of the party in power. if they don t, they stir up more public anger,  said paulo diez, an anti corruption lawyer who has taken on the government in high profile graft scandals. four days after becoming acting attorney general, alberto elias beltran dismissed santiago nieto on the grounds he had broken the office s code of conduct for public officials, his office said on friday. the dismissal was attacked by the conservative national action party (pan) and the leftist party of the democratic revolution (prd), opposition parties which questioned the impartiality of pena nieto s government.      santiago nieto told newspaper reforma on wednesday that lozoya s letter was a bid to secure  impunity  and that odebrecht money had entered political campaigns. nieto s office confirmed the letter s existence, as well as the investigation into the former pemex chief executive, when contacted by reuters. lozoya said in a press conference that he is innocent of all accusations and that he did not funnel cash to president pena nieto s campaign.  president pena nieto has also previously denied odebrecht bribes made their way into his party s coffers.  lozoya s lawyer, javier coello, denied his client had written seeking leniency interviews.  coello also shared with reuters a letter sent to santiago nieto, in which lozoya asked to be informed of any criminal investigation into him, and to be called to testify if needed. that letter did not mention any appeals for clemency. odebrecht has admitted to u.s. and brazilian prosecutors that it paid $10.5 million in bribes in mexico. details of the payments have not been made public, though in august, brazilian and mexican media reported that lozoya had asked odebrecht executives for bribes in 2012 in return for contracts, citing testimony from odebrecht employees.  on monday this week, attorney general raul cervantes stood down, telling senators his office had concluded investigations into odebrecht. however, the details have yet to be published.

" nine senators from his own republican party urged president donald trump on thursday to take a “tough minded” approach to russia, joining a growing chorus of lawmakers addressing concerns that he might be too conciliatory toward moscow. the nine senators, including the senate’s number two republican, john cornyn, wrote in a letter to trump that cooperation with moscow is essential in many areas, but calling for tough action on ukraine, syria and cyber security. “however, while we should seek common ground with russia in the areas of mutual interest, we must never pursue cooperation with russia at the expense of our fundamental interests of defending our allies and promoting our values,” they wrote. the letter said the united states should condemn, and take steps to stop, russian aggression in ukraine, including maintaining sanctions and imposing new ones as necessary. they also want trump to send ukraine lethal weapons to defend itself. trump’s open admiration for russian president vladimir putin and promises to rebuild frayed u.s. ties with moscow have raised questions, in washington and among u.s. allies, over his commitment to maintaining sanctions against russia for its involvement in fighting in ukraine and annexation of crimea from ukraine. the letter also said washington should not enter into any agreement with moscow on syria until russia stops supporting the government of syrian president bashar al assad. and it said washington should counter cyber attacks blamed on russia. the letter was led by senator cory gardner. besides cornyn and gardner, it was also signed by jim inhofe, todd young, rob portman, mike rounds, joni ernst, susan collins and lindsey graham. republicans and democrats in the senate and house of representatives have also introduced legislation seeking additional action against russia, although there has been no action on most of those bills just three weeks into the trump administration. some lawmakers have also sought to give congress a voice over whether trump, who has issued a series of executive orders on a range of issues, can ease current sanctions on russia.

" cuba and the united states will meet next week for a third round of talks on improving relations, havana said on thursday, adding that the two former cold war foes were not yet negotiating their multibillion dollar claims against one another. a bilateral commission will meet next monday in the cuban capital to evaluate the progress made in putting their decades old conflict behind them, and to identify new areas of cooperation, said gustavo machin, the deputy director for u.s. affairs in the cuban foreign ministry. “we will set the agenda for the rest for the year,” machin told a news conference. “we are not yet negotiating the topic of claims even if there is a recognition on both sides that these exist.” cuba and the u.s. reestablished diplomatic relations a year ago and have signed agreements on issues of common concern such as the environment, postal services and direct flights. many differences remain however. machin reiterated cuba’s demands for the return of the guantanamo naval base and lifting of the u.s. trade embargo. cuba complains that some of the policy changes the u.s. has carried out, such as relaxing currency restrictions against the island, have had little real impact given the persistent fear among u.s. institutions of risking government sanctions. the white house said in march it would allow u.s. banks to process dollar transactions for cuba as long as neither buyer nor seller were u.s. entities. “until now, no bank transactions have been carried out in u.s. currency,” machin said. “there is still a great fear.” cuba has said it will only lift a 10 percent tax on cash dollars once it is clear u.s. banks are processing dollar transactions for the communist ruled island. the issue of reparations is another sticky point. late last year, cuba and the u.s. outlined their respective claims, with the former demanding at least $121 billion in reparations for the u.s. trade embargo and other acts it describes as aggressions against the caribbean country. the americans meanwhile are seeking upwards of $10 billion in compensation for nationalized properties. the third bilateral commission will be led by josefina vidal, the cuban foreign ministry’s chief of u.s. affairs, and kristie kenney, counselor for the u.s. state department.

"it s actually quite refreshing to see someone on the right who is unafraid to take off the gloves. his message to those who support amnesty is pretty clear and he s not backing down to political pressure from the left. firing back at univision for its refusal to air his miss usa and miss universe pageants, the outspoken mogul and gop presidential candidate has barred anyone who works for univision from the greens of his miami golf course.in a letter friday to randy falco, trump advised the univision ceo that  under no circumstances is any officer or representative of univision allowed to use trump national doral, miami   its golf courses or any of its facilities. trump also demanded that falco, whose company s miami office is next door to trump national doral,  immediately stop work and close the gate which is being constructed between our respective properties.  trump gave falco one week to take care of that matter, or  we will close it. the letter was dispatched a day after univision declared it was canceling its coverage of the miss usa pageant july 12 on its unimas network as well as the miss universe pageant, which had been scheduled to air on the flagship univision channel next january, and was severing its business relationship with the miss universe organization, which produces both pageants. the reason: what univision called  insulting remarks about mexican immigrants  recently voiced by trump, a part owner of miss universe.during his presidential campaign kickoff speech last week, trump had portrayed immigrants from mexico as  bringing drugs, they re bringing crime, they re rapists, and some, i assume, are good people.  he also called for building a wall along the southern border of the u.s. the remarks drew condemnation from the mexican government as  biased and absurd,  and sparked univision s announcement.trump, who has said his criticism was directed against u.s. policymakers, not the mexican people or its government, stated thursday that univision would be defaulting on an ironclad contract if it doesn t air the pageants. he pledged to take legal action against the company.he also accused the new york-based univision of having ties to mexico that led the network to submit to pressure from mexican leaders to punish him for pro-u.s. positions he expresses as a presidential candidate. they don t want me saying that mexico is killing the united states in trade and killing the united states at the border,  trump had said.in a p.s. to his letter, which was addressed to univision s manhattan headquarters, trump continued on that track.  please congratulate your mexican government officials for having made such outstanding trade deals with the united states,  he wrote falco.  however, inform them that should i become president, those days are over. we are bringing jobs back to the u.s. also, a meaningful border will be immediately created, not the laughingstock that currently exists. the letter was signed,  sincerely, donald j. trump. when asked for comment on trump s letter, univision seemed to be treating it as par for the course.a memo to univision management on thursday directed that, as part of the company s decision to cut ties with miss universe, employees  should not stay at trump properties while on company business or hold events/activities there.

" u.s. homeland security secretary john kelly signed a memorandum on thursday rescinding an obama era plan to spare some illegal immigrant parents of children who are lawful permanent residents from being deported, the department said in a statement. the program, which was announced by president barack obama in 2014, never took effect because it was blocked in federal court.  obama had hoped that overhauling the u.s. immigration system and resolving the fate of the estimated 11 million people in the country illegally would be part of his presidential legacy.    however, president donald trump has vowed to crack down on illegal immigration. the plan unveiled by obama intended to let roughly 4 million people   those who have lived illegally in the united states at least since 2010, have no criminal record and have children who are u.s. citizens or lawful permanent residents   get into a program that shields them from deportation and supplies work permits. however, it was quickly challenged in court by republican governed texas and 25 other states that argued obama had overstepped the powers granted to him by the u.s. constitution by infringing upon the authority of congress.  a federal appeals court blocked the program, and the u.s. supreme court let that ruling stand in a 4 4 split decision last year. kelly said in a statement on thursday he was rescinding the initiative, known as dapa, because “there is no credible path forward to litigate the currently enjoined policy.” an earlier program, deferred action for childhood arrivals (daca), offers some 750,000 immigrants brought to the country illegally as children the chance to attend school and to work.  trump has previously said his administration was devising a policy on how to deal with individuals covered by daca, but no formal changes have been announced. “they shouldn’t be very worried,” trump said of daca recipients in a january abc news interview. “i do have a big heart.” ",0

" republican lawmakers are writing a fix to the puerto rico debt crisis that would give an independent financial review board sweeping power to arbitrate creditor disputes and map a future for the u.s. territory’s pension system. rather than pick winners and losers among investors who hold roughly $70 billion of puerto rican debt, the republican plan envisions leaving key questions to a newly created board, according to legislative sources familiar with the work.  republicans control both houses of congress and so the party leaders often write the first draft of legislation. under the proposal, white house and congressional leaders would appoint a board of financial experts to arbitrate politically charged questions like whether bonds issued by utilities or even the island’s government should be written down.  “we expect to have a framework that protects taxpayers and restores solvency to the island,” said parish braden, spokesman for the natural resources committee that is writing legislation in the house of representatives. a crucial issue for lawmakers is whether puerto rico will have a clear path to restructure debt through the courts, in a process akin to u.s. bankruptcy, if the new board could not facilitate a deal among stakeholders. the u.s. treasury department has long called for a debt restructuring for puerto rico. so have congressional democrats, and puerto rico’s leaders. a spokesman for the treasury department said officials were “encouraged by the increased legislative activity,” but declined to speculate on the republican legislation that was expected to be finished before the end of the month. and while republicans will write the first draft of the rescue bill, democrats in congress and the white house will have a say as legislation moves toward approval from president barack obama. on monday, new jersey senator robert menendez, a democrat, proposed putting roughly $45 billion in unfunded pension liabilities at the top of the list of creditors. some creditors are concerned where they might rank with such a move and many oppose any provision that would allow the island to file for bankruptcy. municipal bond markets would be roiled if puerto rico were cleared, some republican lawmakers have argued.  “these are complicated issues and congress needs to empower people qualified to handle them,” said one staffer working on the plan. the 3.5 million residents of puerto rico may face a reduction of “essential government services” like public safety and health care if there is no fix before the next debt payments in may, puerto rico governor alejandro garcia padilla told congress last year. the menendez plan would restructure all of puerto rico’s debt, establishing a chief financial officer, a “fiscal stability and reform board” and require the island’s governor to develop a 5 year fiscal plan. if puerto rico accepts the plan menendez proposes then an automatic 12 month stay on debt payments would go into effect, after which a restructuring plan with creditors would be crafted. the plan would see that pensions would be paid before the  island’s general obligation debt, which is typically the first in line for payment. padilla praised menendez’s plan for providing tools needed to stave off the immediate impact of the crisis while helping to stabilize the economy. orrin hatch, the utah republican who is chairman of the powerful senate finance committee, swatted away menendez’s proposals. “while i have yet to see the full legislative text of the proposals, from what i’ve read, senate democrats appear to want to move the goal posts on broad debt restructuring,” hatch said in a statement emailed to reuters.

" u.s. attorney general jeff sessions on monday defended his conduct at a january confirmation hearing where he denied having contacts with russian officials during the course of the presidential campaign when he was an adviser to donald trump. “my answer was correct,” sessions, who last week said he would stay out of any probe into alleged russian interference in the 2016 presidential election, wrote in a letter to senate judiciary committee chairman chuck grassley. sessions repeated that he spoke to russian ambassador sergei kislyak during the republican national convention in cleveland in july, and again at his senate office in washington in september. at a news conference on thursday, sessions said he should have said during the confirmation hearing that he had met with the ambassador in his role as a senator. the washington post first disclosed the meetings on wednesday. many democrats, who are pushing for a broad probe of ties between trump campaign associates and russian operatives, have called for sessions to resign. sessions, then a u.s. senator from alabama, was a high ranking player in trump’s 2016 campaign. sessions’ denial of contacts with russians had come in response to a question by democratic senator al franken about what he would do if reports of contacts between trump associates and russians were true. “i did not mention communications i had had with the russian ambassador over the years because the question did not ask about them,” session wrote in the letter to grassley, which he said was meant to supplement his january testimony. sessions said his recusal would apply not just to any alleged russian contact with the trump campaign, but also with the trump transition team and administration. “this should not be taken as any evidence of the existence of any such investigation or its scope,” he added. the republican president has backed his attorney general and accused democrats of blowing the issue out of proportion for political purposes. u.s. intelligence agencies concluded last year that russia hacked and leaked democratic emails during the election campaign as part of an effort to tilt the vote in trump’s favor. russia has denied the allegations.

" the republican led congress averted a u.s. government shutdown on friday and gave lawmakers another week to work out federal spending through sept. 30, with tricky issues like defense spending still unresolved. the senate passed a stopgap spending bill by voice vote without opposition after the house earlier approved it by a tally of 382 30. president donald trump later signed the legislation, preventing a shutdown of many parts of the federal government on saturday, his 100th day in office. the bill provides federal funding through may 5, allowing lawmakers to hammer out legislation in the coming days to keep the government funded for the rest of the fiscal year ending sept. 30. congress for months has been tied in knots trying to untangle $1 trillion in spending priorities. lawmakers were supposed to have taken care of the current fiscal year appropriations bills by last oct. 1. democrats backed the stopgap bill a day after house republican leaders again put off a vote on major healthcare legislation sought by trump and opposed by democrats to dismantle the 2010 affordable care act, dubbed obamacare, after republican moderates balked at provisions added to entice hard line conservatives. republicans, already facing accusations from the opposition democrats that they are unable to govern even though they control congress and the white house, are motivated to avert the first government shutdown since 2013, but contentious matters remain on a spending bill covering the final five months of the fiscal year. with trump seeking $30 billion in new defense spending in the measure and democrats arguing that other domestic programs also need more money, congressional negotiators are moving toward a compromise. republican and democratic negotiators have discussed a possible $15 billion defense spending hike, half of trump’s request, according to two congressional aides familiar with the matter. it was unclear whether democrats will continue to insist other domestic programs get a similar funding increase. such equal treatment was at the core of some previous funding deals. unlike the simmering fights in congress over healthcare and taxes, in which republicans are pursuing purely partisan legislation, major spending bills generally need bipartisan support for passage, lending some optimism that the negotiations will end next week without a federal shutdown. house and senate appropriators were expected to work through this weekend, but there were no guarantees they would be able to find common ground that would prevent parts of the government from shutting down on may 6. congressional negotiators also have been struggling over funding to make a healthcare program for coal miners permanent and whether to plug a gap in puerto rico’s medicaid program, the government health insurance program for the poor. senate majority leader mitch mcconnell said the stopgap bill, which kept funding at current levels, “will carry us through next week so that a bipartisan agreement can be reached.” mcconnell said he expected the house by the middle of next week to approve and send to the senate the spending bill for the remaining five months of the fiscal year. senate democratic leader chuck schumer said there were still significant differences with republicans over elements of the looming longer term spending bill but “we’re willing to extend things for a little bit more time” in hope more progress can be made. the no. 2 house democrat, steny hoyer of maryland, said he would oppose any more temporary spending bills for this year. during debate in the house, lawmakers expressed frustration at the inability of congress to take care of the basic functions of government in a timely manner. “we are seven months into the fiscal year,” said representative nita lowey of new york, the top democrat on the house appropriations committee. “federal departments and agencies have been operating on outdated funding levels and policies for more than half of the year. this is unacceptable and it cannot continue.”  lowey noted that this was the third stopgap spending measure passed since the fiscal year began last october. white house spokesman sean spicer told reporters aboard air force one the white house feels “very good” about getting the funding extension next week through the end of the fiscal year. trump earlier bowed to democratic demands that the spending legislation for the rest of the fiscal year not include money to start building a wall along the u.s. mexico border he said is needed to fight illegal immigration and stop drug smugglers. the trump administration also agreed to continue funding for a major component of obamacare despite republican vows to end the program.

" connecticut’s senate passed a bill wednesday morning that could allow the state to buy power from dominion energy inc’s millstone nuclear power plant. earlier this week, dominion said it will begin a “strategic reassessment” of the 2,088 megawatt millstone plant after another bill that would allow the state to buy power from the plant failed to get enough votes. that other bill was senate bill 106. senate bill 778, which the senate passed this morning, authorizes the commissioner of the state department of energy & environmental protection to conduct an appraisal to determine whether the state will conduct a competitive procurement process for nuclear power. before it becomes law, bill 778 has to pass the state house before the session ends at midnight wednesday and be signed by the governor. connecticut is one of several states looking for ways to boost their nuclear plants’ revenues to keep them in service to preserve benefits they provide, including carbon free energy, jobs, taxes and energy diversification. in 2016, new york and illinois adopted rules to subsidize some reactors that were in danger of closing before their licenses expire as cheap and abundant shale gas has cut power prices over the past several years, making it uneconomic for nuclear operators to keep some units operating. while other generators with mostly gas fired plants, like nrg energy inc, dynegy inc and calpine corp, challenge those new york and illinois rules in federal court, other states   ohio, pennsylvania and new jersey   have considered adopting similar rules to protect their reactors. “we don’t believe that fair and equitable power markets can be sustained when giving handouts or subsidies to nuclear operators. the suggestion that dominion is somehow in a lesser position to participate in the power market is pure fiction,” said nrg spokesman david gaier. if the connecticut commissioner decides to go forward with the nuclear power purchases, the state can either require electric utilities to buy nuclear power for a period of three to ten years, or issue a solicitation for baseload zero carbon resources, including nuclear. ken holt, a spokesman at millstone, said it was premature to speculate on what the company may do if bill 778 does not pass. he said dominion has already sold 85 percent of the power millstone is expected to generate in 2017 to hedge funds and other purchasers. while the company usually sells some of the plant’s power three years in advance, holt said dominion has not sold millstone’s power beyond this year because it was waiting to see where prices would go and the outcome of the legislation. next day power prices in new england averaged $35.40 per megawatt hour in 2016, the lowest on record, according to reuters data going back to 2001. that compares with a 10 year average (2007 2016) of $59.02.

" new jersey governor chris christie, an early supporter of u.s. president elect donald trump, is considering a run to lead the republican national committee, politico reported on thursday. reuters could not immediately confirm the report, and representatives for christie did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  christie, whose term as governor ends in january 2018, had been leading trump’s transition team until u.s. vice president elect mike pence recently took over earlier this month. current rnc chairman reince priebus has been tapped to serve as trump’s chief of staff when he starts his white house term jan. 20, 2017. christie had launched a presidential bid alongside trump in a pool of 17 candidates that eventually saw trump, a new york businessman who had never held political office, win the nomination as well as the nov. 8 presidential election over democrat hillary clinton.  christie had been a rising political star before the so called “bridgegate” scandal involving his former top aides that left his reputation in tatters.   pence took over from christie, who at one time had been considered a possible candidate to serve as trump’s attorney general, a post that instead went to u.s. senator jeff sessions of alabama. trump’s team has said christie would remain as vice chair of the transition effort. earlier this month, christie’s two former aides were convicted for shutting down access lanes to the george washington bridge in 2013, creating a days long traffic jam. the scheme was intended to punish the town’s mayor, a democrat, for declining to endorse christie’s reelection campaign.

" erik duhaime is a passive stock market investor, but he isn’t afraid to short donald trump or go long on hillary clinton. the 28 year old from cambridge, massachusetts, trades on predictit, an online political stock market that allows users to wager small amounts of money on “yes” or “no” predictions about whether an event will occur. that includes who will win the u.s. presidential election in november. “this is probably one of the ways i restrain myself from being active in the stock market,” said duhaime, a phd student at massachusetts institute of technology sloan school of management, who checks the site a few times a week for fun. predictit, which was launched in 2014, now has more than 30,000 traders registered, up from 19,000 at the end of 2015, and has received shout outs from pundits and presidential campaign advisors alike. users must be u.s. residents and registered voters. predictit says it is not like an online gambling site because it mainly exists to supply its data to universities for academic research, one of the main reasons the u.s. commodity futures trading commission allows it to operate legally, according to a letter issued by the regulator in 2014. it is jointly run by victoria university in wellington, new zealand, and a washington based political consulting firm aristotle international inc.  unlike mainstream financial markets, bets are not big: the cftc caps each participant’s position at $850 per market, and the average deposit when people sign up is just $100. the regulator hasn’t been as friendly to such betting sites in the past. in 2012, the cftc filed a civil complaint against the now defunct intrade for violating a ban on off exchange options trading. the ireland based market also allowed people to wager money on “yes” or “no” questions, but it wasn’t tied to an academic institution and didn’t have a cap on the maximum amount that could be traded.  predictions markets like predictit and a similar venue run by the university of iowa have emerged as an alternative to polling for election forecasters. predictit is bigger than the iowa electronic markets, which has only about 2,000 active traders with access to its political markets. “polling is very expensive,” said david rothschild, an economist at microsoft research who runs a predictions market aggregator called predictwise, which draws heavily from predictit. “it’s a slow process. it’s not very flexible.” knowledge of polls does also feed into betting decisions on predictit. “predictions markets translate this and other information into probability,” said rajiv sethi, professor of economics at barnard college. “the basic intuition is that it’s a ‘wisdom of crowds’ effect.”     for example, trump’s chances of securing the republican nomination for the presidential election swung dramatically on the site over the past three months as the primary season progressed. a trump share shot from 30 cents in early february when he lost to rival ted cruz in the iowa primary to 80 cents a month later when trump dominated on super tuesday. they then lost half their value by early april as cruz appeared to regain momentum with a big win in wisconsin. with cruz and another rival, john kasich, now out of the race, trump had risen to 94 cents by monday. for graphic showing trump's ascendancy on predictit during primary season, see tmsnrt.rs/1wmrq for november’s election, though, trump is trailing on predictit with 40 cents against clinton’s 59 cents.  while predictit’s precision has yet to be closely examined by academics, other predictions markets such as the iowa electronic markets, have proven to be just as accurate as polls, experts who have studied them said. predictit markets go beyond topics related to u.s. elections. users also put the probability of a north korea hydrogen bomb test this year at only 29 cents, and a british exit from the european union by 2017 at just 30 cents. the idea for predictit was first thought up in the mid 1990s by lew evans, professor of economics at the university of victoria. it took until 2008, for the market, called “ipredict” in new zealand, to get up and running.  early on, it focused primarily on new zealand politics, and research showed ipredict out performed the majority of polls in predicting the results in two of new zealand’s last three general elections. however, new anti money laundering laws in new zealand put an end to ipredict last year after the cost of verifying users’ identities to comply with the rules threatened to blow through ipredict’s shoe string budget.   predictit attracts everyone from campaign volunteers to political junkies. in mid april, about 30 predictit traders gathered at a bar in new york to watch the state’s primary results roll in. “i think it’s a good source of collective wisdom,” said brian hegarty, who was at the event. hegarty, who worked for kasich’s campaign, reads political news, but also relied on picking up information through his campaign experience. that didn’t always translate to a bet in favor of kasich. he said he put money on republican candidate marco rubio to win the minnesota caucus because he had overheard someone who was working for the florida senator express confidence about rubio’s chances. it turned out to be one of the few states rubio won before dropping out in mid march. duhaime, the mit student, said he usually bets against candidates he believes are likely to flame out.  “for me, trump was one of those people,” he said. “i shorted trump way back in july, and it hasn’t been fun watching.”  after trump’s win in indiana in early may, duhaime was down nearly $1,000, about a third of the money he put into predictit.  “i still think it was a one in a hundred thing,” duhaime, who doesn’t identify as a democrat but is a fan of president barack obama, said of the trump phenomenon. “obviously i’m bummed, but i’m sort of more concerned for other reasons.”

" mamadu bassir sits eating a breakfast of warm milk and cookies in a migrants shelter in rome   one of nearly 65,000 lone youngsters who have survived the perilous sea journey from north africa to italy in the past four years. his meal finished, the gangly 17 year old tells the story of his trip from guinea, via a libyan prison where a guard knocked out three of his teeth with a club, to his crossing of the mediterranean, where he watched a friend drown in front of him. both fell into the water as migrants scrabbled out of their deflating rubber boat to reach rescuers. bassir could not swim but someone threw him a life jacket just in time.  i fell in the sea, but italians saved me,  he says. then he puts his head on the table and starts to cry. for many of his fellow young migrants, the dangers do not stop when they reach dry land.  four months ago, italy passed a law aimed at protecting child immigrants, even those who do not qualify as refugees, providing them with housing, food, healthcare and an education. but without adult guidance and under pressure to send money home, campaigners say thousands end up back in the hands of smugglers or exploited to work long hours for little pay. many want to reach relatives in other european countries, but increased border security in france, switzerland and austria often means they have to pay high fees to be smuggled north.  they (the minors) are the most vulnerable elements of this big phenomenon called migration,  said kostas moschochoritis, head of humanitarian group intersos, which operates the shelter for unaccompanied minors in rome where bassir, who has nowhere to go, has been sleeping.  it has hosted 4,000 unaccompanied minors since 2011, and just opened a new shelter with more beds on the outskirts of the capital.   more than 5,000 minors have left the communities where they had been living this year,  said raffaela milano, a director at save the children in italy.  of these, it s inevitable that some are exploited.    we have the stereotype in europe that they are adults because they have been through so much. it s not true. they are still kids,  milano said.  syed hasnain, a 28 year old afghan, arrived in italy a decade ago. his mother sent him away when he was 10 years old to keep the taliban from taking him to fight. now he helps youngsters like bassir.  the fundamental thing that they want to do when they arrive in italy is to get a job,  hasnain said.   italians cannot give him jobs  because the teenagers, mostly boys, do not yet speak italian, so  he goes to the people from his country... they know that he needs money because his family puts pressure on him  to send money home, hasnain said.  the majority of them, they say,  i miss my family, my country, my culture, my society, but the main thing that i miss is my mum,  he said.  for now, bassir is making his way with the help of charities like intersos. he is taking italian classes, and has an immigration lawyer helping get the documents he needs to either work legally or to go to school. he longs to see his mother in guinea, but is determined to stay where he is.  if i stay in europe, i ll have more of a future,  he says.

" south korea s foreign ministry stressed the pyeongchang olympics will be safe from north korean provocations in a briefing to diplomats and executives at foreign companies in the country on friday, as concerns persist over tensions with the north. officials and executives from around 120 embassies and companies in south korea were hosted by the ministry to explain the government s efforts for a safe olympic games scheduled for feb. 9 25 next year, officials told reuters.  we will consider it our top priority to ensure the safety and security of each and every national team, the olympic family, and all the spectators visiting pyeongchang during the games,  said park enna, a foreign ministry official, in opening remarks at the meeting.  (we) will thoroughly prepare the pyeongchang olympics so that it may be regarded as the safest olympics in history.  briefing topics included current events regarding north korea and the korean peninsula as well as preparations in general for the pyeongchang olympics, she added. officials from the united states, japan, russia and china, as well as members of chambers of commerce for japan, china and europe were to attend, according to the ministry. an official at the japanese chamber of commerce in south korea told reuters ahead of the meeting they were not specifically aware which companies were planning to attend as the ministry appears to have contacted businesses separately. park said the un olympic truce resolution, which has been adopted every two years since 1993 to cease all conflicts during the period of the truce, will be adopted at the un general assembly on nov. 13 for the pyeongchang games. tensions on the korean peninsula have risen in recent months as north korea s leader kim jong un and u.s. president donald trump exchanged threats and insults over the north s nuclear and missile development program. concerns over safety grew in tandem as the games will take place just 80 km (50 miles) from the demilitarized zone between north and south korea, the world s most heavily armed border.  france s sports minister laura flessel said last month that if the crisis in the region deepened and athletes  security could not be guaranteed then they would not travel to the games. members of france s winter olympics team, however, have remained optimistic the country will not boycott. park said governments reportedly hesitant on participating in the games have stated their position to partake in and support the coming olympics. rattled by rising tensions with north korea, south korea has been taking extra measures to try to ensure the safety of the 2018 winter games, including setting up a crack cyber defense team and doubling the number of troops, according to officials and documents reviewed by reuters. north and south korea remain technically at war after their 1950 53 conflict with a truce and not a peace treaty.

" u.s. health insurer unitedhealth group inc on tuesday said it would largely exit the obamacare individual insurance market in 2017, citing expectations for mounting losses from the program. unitedhealth is the largest u.s. health insurer and one of the biggest sellers of plans on the exchanges, which were created as part of president barack obama’s national healthcare law. unitedhealth sells these plans in 34 states this year, up from 25 states last year. “next year, we will remain in only a handful of states,” unitedhealth ceo stephen hemsley said in prepared remarks as part of the company’s first quarter earnings report.  the company warned investors late last year that it was losing money on the new plans and might exit the market. on tuesday, the company raised its 2016 expectation for losses on the exchanges by $125 million to $650 million. unitedhealth’s hemsley said that the shorter term, higher risk profile of the new members, as well as the smaller than expected enrollment, suggested unitedhealth could not offer plans on a sustained basis.  for the first quarter, united health’s profit was better than expected and unitedhealth shares rose 1.9 percent to $130.29 in early new york stock exchange trading.  other health insurers including aetna inc and anthem inc are also large players on the exchanges. in recent months they said they will continue to sell exchange plans.  the company has 795,000 customers from the exchanges, more than half of them new to unitedhealth, it said. it expects about 650,000 members by year end.  the government said in february that more than 12 million people had signed up for obamacare related insurance through healthcare.gov or a state based exchange as of jan. 31. previous government expectations had been for more than 20 million people. unitedhealth raised its expectations for 2016 profit, in part because of a more favorable tax rate that also helped it beat wall street expectations for the first quarter. lower sales and administrative costs and a decline in amortization of intangible assets also helped its first quarter results. on an adjusted basis the health insurer earned $1.81 per share, compared with wall street analyst expectations for earnings of $1.72 per share, according to thomsonreuters i/b/e/s. net profit rose to $1.61 billion, or $1.67 per share, from $1.41 billion or $1.46 per share, a year earlier.  the company now expects 2016 adjusted net earnings of $7.75 $7.95 per share, up 15 cents per share from its previous estimate.

" militants have crossed into pakistan from afghanistan and killed a pakistani army officer and a soldier, the pakistani military said on monday. the uneasy neighbors, both of which are important u.s. allies, accuse each other of harboring militants on either side of the border, and their two armies have exchanged fire across it during periods of tension over recent years. four pakistani soldiers were wounded in the attack on a military post in the northwestern region of bajaur, the army said.  it did not say when the raid took place but said up to 10 of the attackers were believed to have been killed in pakistani retaliatory fire. independent verification was not possible as the area is largely closed off to reporters. pakistan and afghanistan share a rugged, porous border of 2,500 km (1,500 miles).  afghanistan, which does not recognize the border, has lately been angry over a pakistani plan to build a fence along most of it. the pakistani army said the absence of afghan central government s writ on its side of the border facilitated such militant attacks. there was no immediate response from the afghan government. the attack came a week after unidentified gunmen shot and killed a pakistani diplomat near his residence in the eastern afghan city of jalalabad.

" canadian police are investigating the mysterious deaths of pharmaceuticals billionaire barry sherman, founder of apotex inc, and his wife honey, whose bodies were found in their toronto mansion on friday. authorities were conducting post mortem examinations on saturday and treating the deaths as suspicious. a toronto police spokesman said that nothing had been ruled out in the probe. two canadian newspapers reported that police were investigating the deaths as a possible murder suicide, citing unidentified police sources.  the bodies were found hanging from a railing on the edge of a basement swimming pool, the globe and mail and toronto sun reported, citing police sources. the newspapers reported that investigators were working on the theory that barry sherman, 75, killed his wife, hung her body and then hanged himself at the pool s edge.  apotex released a statement saturday saying that the sherman family was disturbed by the reports.  we are shocked and think it s irresponsible that police sources have reportedly advised the media of a theory which neither their family, their friends nor their colleagues believe to be true,  said the statement, which was attributed to the family of barry and honey sherman.  we urge the toronto police service to conduct a thorough, intensive and objective criminal investigation, and urge the media to refrain from further reporting as to the cause of these tragic deaths until the investigation is completed,  it said. toronto police constable david hopkinson said police are awaiting post mortem results and no determinations have been made as to the cause and manner of deaths.   there s a whole bunch of different scenarios here. we are not ruling anything out,  he said.  about a dozen police officers canvassed neighbors for information on the case saturday while a forensics photographer took pictures of the snow covered estate.   the deaths shocked canada s political, business and philanthropic elite, prompting a flood of condolences from business leaders and politicians including prime minister justin trudeau. barry sherman was a prominent donor to canada s ruling liberal party, drawing on a fortune that forbes estimated at $3.2 billion. canadian advocacy group democracy watch criticized him last year for involvement in a fundraiser for the liberals while registered as a government lobbyist. sherman founded generic drugmaker apotex in 1974, building it into one of the world s largest pharmaceutical makers. it has annual sales of more than c$2 billion in more than 45 countries, according to its website. he stepped down as ceo in 2012, but stayed on as chairman. sherman was involved in a series of lawsuits, including a decade long battle with cousins seeking compensation over allegations he cut them out of the company that would make him rich. police found out about the shermans  deaths at about midday friday while responding to an emergency call.  authorities have not said who made the call, though canadian media reported the couple s bodies were found by a real estate agent helping them sell their home, which was on the market for c$6.9 million ($5.4 million).  the real state agent could not be reached for comment. the shermans, who had four children, were major donors to hospitals, universities and jewish organizations. honey sherman sat on the boards of several hospital, charitable and jewish foundations, and last month was awarded a senate medal for community service.  she immigrated to canada as a child when jewish immigrant aid services relocated her family shortly after the holocaust, according to a profile of the couple on the jewish foundation of greater toronto s website.

" a united states citizen working in south sudan as a freelance journalist was among 19 people killed on saturday during fighting between government troops and  rebels in yei river state, the rebels and the military said. christopher allen, who worked for various news outlets, was killed in heavy fighting in the town of kaya. south sudan has been convulsed by conflict since late 2013, pitting president salva kiir s troops against those of rebel leader riek machar.  on the ground, about 16 (bodies) have been found around the defensive position of the spla including this white man,  santo domic chol, a military spokesman, told reuters. three government soldiers were also killed, he said. the rebels identified him as allen, who had been embedded with them for the past week.   we are sad for his family. he came here to tell our story ,  said one rebel who knew allen. he asked not to be named but said allen had been in the middle of the fighting and wearing a jacket marked press. chol said  the rebels had attacked an army base in kaya but they were repulsed after an hour long fight. the u.s. government did not respond immediately when reuters sought comment.  the country spiraled into civil war, with fighting along ethnic lines, after kiir sacked machar in late 2013. a peace accord was signed in august 2015 and machar returned to the capital in april last year to share power with kiir, before the deal fell apart less than three months later and machar and his supporters fled the capital. the conflict has forced about 4 million people to flee their homes. uganda currently hosts more than a million south sudanese refugees, while over 330,000 have fled to neighboring ethiopia.

" democratic presidential candidate martin o’malley, a former maryland governor, is under investigation for buying furniture from the state executive mansion at sharply discounted prices as he left office, the washington post reported on friday. the o’malley family paid $9,638 for beds, chairs, desk lamps, mirrors and other items from the mansion’s living quarters after the administration declared them “excess property,” the paper said. the furnishing originally cost $62,000, according to the baltimore sun, which first reported the furniture purchase and the investigation, the post said. the post cited haley morris, a spokeswoman for o’malley’s presidential campaign, as saying the investigation by the anne arundel county state’s attorney office was “a bogus political attack that the maryland republicans have tried to make stick.” morris said o’malley bought the furniture under the same procedures used by his predecessor when he moved out of the executive mansion, the post reported. o’malley has said he followed the procedures outlined to him by the state and paid the depreciated rate for the furniture as laid out by the state’s department of general services. o’malley is lagging far behind hillary clinton and bernie sanders in the race for the democratic presidential nomination.

" three united nations soldiers from chad were killed and two others wounded by an explosive device as they were escorting a convoy in northern mali on thursday, the peacekeeping mission in the west african nation said.  more than 80 members of the un mission, known as minusma, have been killed since 2013 in attacks by militant groups active in the country s north and center, making it the world s deadliest peacekeeping operation.  the mission said in a statement that the peacekeepers  vehicle struck the explosive device between the northern towns of tessalit and aguelhok around 2:30 p.m. (1430 gmt).  minusma spokesman olivier salgado later told radio france internationale that the soldiers involved were from chad, which has one of the region s most effective armies.  i condemn with the greatest energy such abject acts, whose only objective is to destabilize the country and harm the peace process under way in mali,  said interim mission chief koen davidse. the rise of jihadist groups   some linked to al qaeda and islamic state   in the arid sahel has alarmed western powers like france, which has deployed thousands of troops to the region in response.  four u.s. special forces troops were killed earlier this month in neighbouring niger by fighters believed to belong to a local islamic state affiliate operating out of mali. militants have exploited porous borders   particularly between mali, niger and burkina faso   to step up attacks on military and civilian targets, including tourist sites in regional capitals. the g5 sahel, an anti terrorism taskforce of soldiers from those three countries, as well as chad and mauritania, plans to launch its first joint operations in the coming days.

" when donald trump started thinking during his campaign for the presidency last year about filling a supreme court vacancy, he turned to a group of washington insiders at the controls of a well oiled machine that puts conservative judges on the bench. that disciplined network of operatives, shepherded by judicial activist leonard leo, on friday delivered for trump his first major accomplishment as u.s. president: the confirmation of conservative neil gorsuch as a supreme court justice.  unlike the chaotic rollouts of other trump policy initiatives, the gorsuch nomination went relatively smoothly. democrats put up a fight in the senate, but they lacked the votes to block the republican majority and they lost. other key players included experienced washington hands such as senate majority leader mitch mcconnell, former senator kelly ayotte and white house counsel don mcgahn.  “it worked because it was all planned out before the nomination. we know what works, what doesn’t work, what resources we need. we know the other side’s arguments and how to answer them. it’s like war,” leo told reuters on friday. the only surprise stumble in the effort came when trump attacked judges who blocked his order banning u.s. entry by people from certain muslim majority countries. gorsuch distanced himself from the president’s twitter messages. other than that, discipline was maintained from the first of five meetings that leo, a veteran of bush era judicial confirmation battles, attended with trump. the two met twice before the election.  leo helped compile a list of potential nominees for trump. that helped win over conservative activists unsure of trump’s ideological compass at a time when he was still fighting for the republican presidential nomination. a second, longer list came in september. it included gorsuch, a federal judge. the campaign for gorsuch’s confirmation would not have happened without mcconnell, who stopped former president barack obama, a democrat, from filling the high court vacancy created when conservative icon antonin scalia died in february 2016. after trump won the election, he named mcgahn, a washington based campaign finance lawyer at jones day, as white house counsel. known by his colleagues as “the quiet man,” mcgahn managed the nomination from inside the administration. leo, who reported to mcgahn, pushed back against democrats’ claims that trump basically out sourced the nomination process to outside groups. leo said mcgahn carefully scrutinized the lists of nominees and was not simply a rubber stamp. the gorsuch campaign got heavy marketing and promotion backing from the judicial crisis network (jcn), a coordinating body for conservative and grassroots groups. it launched $10 million in pro gorsuch advertising, targeting in particular senate democrats facing re election contests in 2018.  the jcn was born during the administration of former president george w. bush, when republicans realized a strong outside campaign was critical to getting conservatives on the court.  carrie severino, the group’s chief counsel, said the fact trump agreed to stick to the nominees list made her job easier. “we were prepared for several possibilities, and we had ads, websites, research packets, and much more ready to launch the moment a name was confirmed,” she said. leo said conservatives have borrowed techniques from the liberal coalitions that worked to defeat the nomination of robert bork by republican then president ronald reagan in 1987. the jcn also tapped social media and communications professionals. washington public relations heavyweight ron bonjean played a role, reporting to white house press secretary sean spicer.  at the white house, mcgahn and a team in his office held “murder boards” where gorsuch was bombarded with questions senators might ask. legislative affairs director marc short and his team organized visits with senators and worked with ayotte. asked to accompany gorsuch around capitol hill, ayotte accepted, she said in an interview. ayotte had lost her re election bid in november and had criticized trump. but she helped arrange meetings for gorsuch with almost 80 senators. in the end, said sources close to the gorsuch effort, it worked because it was highly regimented. leo said the machine that got gorsuch on the bench is here to stay although he will return to his job as executive vice president of the federalist society, a conservative lawyers’ group. leo hopes trump will tap that machine for a possible second nomination during his presidency. “supreme court confirmations have become full blown political campaigns,” he said.

" the wave of refugees that entered germany in 2015 2016 has slowed its integration efforts, according to a study that also showed little progress since 2005 in leveling the playing field for immigrants on education, employment and incomes. at the height of europe s migration crisis, chancellor angela merkel adopted an open borders policy that drew more than one million refugees into germany in two years. in the prior decade, education opportunities picked up for newly arrived immigrants and people born in germany with at least one foreign parent. but the federal statistics office study released on thursday found the education gap between those categories of migrants and native germans had since widened again, with the proportion of the former lacking a high school certificate growing between 2014 and 2016. the scale of future immigration has become a major sticking point in three party talks that merkel is leading on the formation of a new coalition government, for which she has set an initial deadline of thursday night. while germany s unemployment rate has fallen to its lowest since the country s reunification in 1990, more immigrants were unemployed in 2016 than native germans, the study said. in that year, 13.6 percent of immigrants and 6.2 percent of native germans had low paying jobs. merkel s conservatives have proposed to the coalition talks that a suspension of reunifications between migrants and their family members outside germany should be extended beyond a march 2018 deadline. immigration expert herbert bruecker, a professor at the berlin integration and migration institute, said that would worsen the divide.   our surveys show that people, who are living separated from their families, have a lower life satisfaction and also suffer more often from depression or bitterness,  he said.

" a judge, called a “hater” by donald trump for his handling of a lawsuit related to the businessman’s trump university real estate school, has unsealed documents related to the case. trump, the presumptive republican presidential nominee for the nov. 8 election, is fighting a lawsuit that accuses his school venture of misleading thousands of people who paid up to $35,000 for seminars to learn about the billionaire’s real estate investment strategies. in an order signed on friday, u.s. district judge gonzalo curiel said that materials, including trump university procedures on dealing with students and the media, should be unsealed.  he noted they had already been published by the media organization politico and that a magistrate judge described them previously as “routine” and “commonplace.” at a rally in san diego on friday, trump criticized curiel for his handling of the trump university case. “i have a judge who is a hater of donald trump. a hater. he’s a hater,” trump said. “we’re in front of a very hostile judge. the judge was appointed by barack obama,” trump said, adding he believed curiel was mexican. curiel is an american who was born in east chicago, indiana, and graduated from the indiana university school of law. legal scholars said trump could face consequences for slamming the judge, although many speculated that curiel was unlikely to sanction him formally.  “mr. trump’s conduct could be subject to sanction for indirect criminal contempt of court,” said charles geyh, a legal ethics expert at the indiana university maurer school of law. “he has impugned the honesty of the judge in a pending case, and has done so in the context of a political rally that seems calculated to intimidate by inciting anger among his supporters,” he said. arthur hellman, an expert on federal courts and judicial ethics at the university of pittsburgh school of law, said the judge was in a difficult position. “he can’t respond directly. he’s not supposed to talk out of court about proceedings before him. judges have gotten into trouble defending themselves from attacks. the judge’s hands are really tied,” he said. trump has drawn criticism for his comments about immigrants from mexico, some of whom he has said were criminals and rapists.  he has proposed building a wall along the u.s. border with mexico to prevent illegal immigration and requiring mexico to pay for it. hispanics are a critical voting bloc in u.s. presidential elections. last week, trump knocked one of the highest profile hispanic women in the republican party, criticizing new mexico governor susana martinez for her handling of the state’s economy.  her office said his criticisms were not substantive. martinez has been touted as a potential vice presidential pick for a republican ticket.

" new jersey prosecutors on friday said they would not pursue criminal misconduct charges against governor chris christie in connection with the “bridgegate” scandal. the office of the bergen county prosecutor said in a letter to a local judge it did not have sufficient evidence to prove allegations that christie knew about a plot to close lanes at the george washington bridge in 2013 in order to punish a local mayor for failing to endorse christie’s re election bid. “the reason is simple, but compelling   that charge cannot be proven beyond a reasonable doubt,” the letter said. bill brennan, a retired firefighter and activist who announced he would run for governor this year, filed the citizen complaint against christie last september. two former christie allies were convicted last year of orchestrating the lane closure plot, and u.s. prosecutors introduced evidence at trial suggesting the governor was at least aware of the scheme. christie has steadfastly denied that he knew about the closures at the time. roy mcgeady, a municipal judge in fort lee, had found probable cause to allow the case against christie to proceed after a hearing at which brennan testified. christie’s lawyer was not permitted to argue or cross examine, mcgeady said, because the governor was not a defendant until probable cause was established. bergen county superior court judge bonnie mizdol rejected christie’s subsequent request to toss the complaint outright. but she agreed with both christie’s lawyers and county prosecutors that mcgeady erroneously denied the governor’s attorney an opportunity to participate. the bergen county prosecutor’s office said in the letter that citizen complaints typically allege minor crimes of which the complainant has personal knowledge. the letter said criminal misconduct was far outside that scope. “in short, a matter of this gravity should not have been heard by a municipal court judge,” the letter said. brian murray, a spokesman for christie, applauded the decision on friday. “the governor is gratified that the bergen county prosecutor’s office has ended this baseless fiasco began by mr. brennan and perpetuated by judge mcgeady,” murray said in a statement. “it is right and appropriate that this injustice against the governor is finally over.” ",0
" the two reuters journalists who were detained in myanmar on dec. 12 have appeared in court and been remanded in custody, a police spokesman said on thursday.  yes, they were sent to the court,  said police colonel myo thu soe.  the remand has already been obtained. the case is under the burma state secrets act ... so, for now, they are not allowed to meet with anyone and they are being investigated.  reporters wa lone and kyaw soe oo have been in detention for nine days with no detail on where they are being held. they have not had access to visitors or lawyers. pan ei mon, wa lone s wife, said she was told by police on thursday that both journalists were well and she was allowed to leave food and clothes for them. the authorities are investigating whether they violated the country s colonial era official secrets act, which carries a maximum prison sentence of 14 years. the two journalists had worked on reuters coverage of a crisis in the western state of rakhine, where an estimated 655,000 rohingya muslims have fled from a fierce military crackdown on militants. the ministry of information said last week that wa lone, 31, and kyaw soe oo, 27, had  illegally acquired information with the intention to share it with foreign media . a spokesman for myanmar leader aung san suu kyi said on wednesday that the police had almost completed their investigation, after which a court case would begin and the reporters would have access to a lawyer and be able to meet members of their families. the spokesman said he was told by the ministry of home affairs and police that the two men were being detained in yangon, myanmar s largest city, were  in good condition  and had not been subject to  illegal questioning. a number of governments and human rights and journalist groups have criticized myanmar s authorities for holding the pair incommunicado since their arrest, with no access to a lawyer, colleagues and family members. myo thu soe, the police spokesman, said:  during the investigation by the police force, we are not torturing them nor doing anything that is not in line with human rights.

" the u.s. senate narrowly approved a tax overhaul on saturday, moving republicans and president donald trump a big step closer to their goal of slashing taxes for businesses and the rich while offering everyday americans a mixed bag of changes. in what would be the largest change to u.s. tax laws since the 1980s, republicans want to add $1.4 trillion over 10 years to the $20 trillion national debt to finance changes that they say would further boost an already growing economy. trump, speaking to reporters as he left the white house for new york hours after the pre dawn vote, praised the senate for passing “tremendous tax reform” and said “people are going to be very, very happy”. once the senate and house of representatives reconcile their respective versions of the legislation, he said, the resulting bill could cut the corporate tax rate from 35 percent “to 20 (percent). it could be 22 (percent) when it comes out. it could also be 20 (percent).” u.s. stock markets have rallied for months on hopes that  washington would provide significant tax cuts for corporations.  celebrating their senate victory, republican leaders predicted the tax cuts would encourage u.s. companies to invest more and boost economic growth.  “we have an opportunity now to make america more competitive, to keep jobs from being shipped offshore and to provide substantial relief to the middle class,” said mitch mcconnell, the republican leader in the senate. the senate approved their bill in a 51 49 vote, with democrats complaining that last minute amendments to win over skeptical republicans were poorly drafted and vulnerable to being gamed later. “the republicans have managed to take a bad bill and make it worse,” said senate democratic leader chuck schumer. “under the cover of darkness and with the aid of haste, a flurry of last minute changes will stuff even more money into the pockets of the wealthy and the biggest corporations.” no democrats voted for the bill, but they were unable to  block it because republicans hold a 52 48 senate majority. talks will begin, likely next week, between the senate and the house, which already has approved its own version of the legislation, to reconcile their respective bills.  trump, who predicted that the negotiations would produce “something beautiful,” wants that to happen before the end of the year. this would allow him and his republicans to score their first major legislative achievement of 2017 after having controlled the white house, the senate and the house since he took office in january. republicans failed in their efforts to repeal the obamacare healthcare law over the summer and trump’s presidency has been hit by white house in fighting and a federal investigation into possible collusion last year between his election campaign team and russian officials.  the tax overhaul is seen by trump and republicans as crucial to their prospects at mid term elections in november 2018, when they will have to defend their majorities in congress.  in a legislative battle that moved so fast a final draft of the bill was unavailable to the public until just hours before the vote, democrats slammed the proposed tax cuts as a give away to businesses and the rich financed with billions of dollars in taxpayer debt. the framework for both the senate and house bills was developed in secret over a few months by a half dozen republican congressional leaders and trump advisers, with little input from the party’s rank and file and none from democrats. six republican senators, who wanted and got last minute amendments and whose votes had been in doubt, said on friday they would back the bill and did so. senator bob corker, one of few remaining republican fiscal hawks who pledged early on to oppose any bill that expanded the federal deficit, was the lone republican dissenter. “i am not able to cast aside my fiscal concerns and vote for legislation that ... could deepen the debt burden on future generations,” said corker, who is not running for re election. numerous last minute changes were made to the bill on friday and in the early morning hours of saturday. one was to make state and local property tax deductible up to $10,000, mirroring the house bill. the senate previously had proposed entirely ending state and local tax deductibility. “the tax reform measure that passed the senate is negative overall for state and local government finances. lower federal tax rates for businesses and individuals could result in a modest boost to hiring and consumption, positively affecting state and local revenues,” nick samuels, vice president at moody’s investors service, said in a statement. “however, the change to the state and local tax (salt) deduction would reduce disposable income for many taxpayers, likely outweighing the positive effect of lower federal rates on consumption in many communities and states.” in another change, the alternative minimum tax (amt), both for individuals and corporations, would not be repealed in full. instead, the individual amt would be adjusted and the corporate amt would be maintained as is, lobbyists said. another change would put a five year limit on letting businesses immediately write off the full value of new capital investments. that would phase out over four years starting in year six, rather than be permanent as initially proposed. under the bill, the corporate tax rate would be permanently slashed to 20 percent from 35 percent, while future foreign profits of u.s. based firms would be largely exempt, both changes pursued by corporate lobbyists for years. on the individual side, the top tax rate paid by the highest income earners would be cut slightly. the tax policy center, a nonpartisan think tank, analyzed an earlier but broadly similar version of the bill passed by the senate tax committee on nov. 16 and found it would reduce taxes for all income groups in 2019 and 2025, with the largest average tax cuts going to the highest income americans. two republican senators announced their support for the bill on friday after winning more tax relief for non corporate pass through businesses. these include partnerships and other companies not organized as public corporations, ranging from mom and pop concerns to large financial and real estate groups. the bill now features a 23 percent tax deduction for such business owners, up from the original 17.4 percent. the senate bill would gut a section of obamacare by repealing a fee paid by some americans who do not buy health insurance, a step critics said would undermine the obamacare system and raise insurance premiums for the sick and the old. senator susan collins, a moderate republican, said she obtained commitments from republican leaders that steps would be taken later in separate legislation to minimize the impact of the repeal of the “individual mandate” fee.

" less than 24 hours after donald trump took office, his presidency started generating controversy.  photographs showing that the crowd at trump’s swearing in was smaller than at barack obama’s first presidential inauguration in 2009 caused the first ruckus in his administration   but not the last.  trump’s first year in office was colored by an investigation into whether his campaign colluded with the russian government to affect the election outcome, insults and threats of war with north korea, and an effort to pass business friendly legislation.  from the start, the white house took a combative approach, accusing the media of framing photographs of the inauguration in a way that appeared to understate the crowd size.  press secretary sean spicer argued that the images were not what they seemed and that crowds of historic size watched trump take the oath of office. protests would become a hallmark of trump’s first year. on jan. 21, the day after the inauguration, hundreds of thousands of women jammed the streets of washington to demonstrate opposition to trump. a week after taking office, the republican president signed an executive order to prevent citizens of seven predominately muslim countries from traveling to the united states. known by critics as the “muslim ban,” protesters quickly demonstrated at airports in opposition.   trump would ignite protests again in august, when he was asked to respond to white nationalists marching in charlottesville, virginia, including one who drove his car into a crowd of counter protesters, killing a woman. the president argued there were bad people “on both sides.”  following his remarks, business leaders resigned from trump’s business councils and the panels were disbanded.     a defining feature of trump’s first year in office was the investigation into whether his campaign colluded with russia during the election. trump ignited a political firestorm in may when he fired federal bureau of investigation director james comey, who had been leading an investigation into possible collusion by the trump 2016 presidential campaign with russia to influence the election outcome. russia has denied meddling in the election and trump has denied any collusion. soon afterward, the justice department named former fbi chief robert mueller as special counsel to lead the investigation. paul manafort, who had briefly served as trump’s campaign manager, and his business associate rick gates were indicted by mueller’s team in october, accused of illegally lobbying on behalf of foreign governments. a month later, michael flynn, who briefly served under trump as u.s. national security adviser, pleaded guilty to lying to the fbi about his conversations last december with russia’s then ambassador in washington just weeks before trump took office. trump has also found himself embroiled in a war of words with north korea over its missile program, exchanging insults and threats with north korean leader kim jong un. at home, trump has struggled to enact sweeping changes he promised on the campaign trail.  he threatened to withdraw the united states from the north american free trade agreement (nafta), but business lobbyists persuaded him to renegotiate it. trump signed an executive order setting up talks on the trilateral trade deal, which has hit roadblocks with mexico and canada.     trump’s team also failed to repeal the affordable care act, known as obamacare despite republican control of the white house and congress. it was not until december that trump made headway on major legislative change as both chambers of congress passed a sweeping tax overhaul.  the bill must be reconciled with a different version approved by the house of representatives, but the senate bill is expected to remain largely intact.

" some activists in hong kong say they plan to defy a chinese law against disrespecting the national anthem, by jeering it at international soccer fixtures against bahrain and lebanon in the next few days. the controversy is another instance of recent tensions in the former british colony between pro democracy advocates and china s communist party leaders, who have been criticized for tightening their grip on hong kong s affairs. hong kong returned from british to chinese rule in 1997 under a  one country, two systems  arrangement that guarantees a high degree of autonomy, including an independent judiciary and the freedom of expression. in recent years, some hong kong fans have booed the national anthem at soccer matches, with some parallels to protests in the united states where american football players have knelt during the national anthem, a protest denounced by u.s. president donald trump. china s parliament on saturday passed an amendment to its criminal law that extends punishments for publicly desecrating the national flag and emblem to disrespecting the national anthem.  offenders can be jailed for up to three years, xinhua reported. hong kong, as part of china, is now obliged to put its own set of laws related to the national anthem to the local legislature, but details including jail terms and the scope of enforcement have yet to be set. for now, though, some fans say they won t change their behavior when hong kong play bahrain in a friendly match on thursday and lebanon in an asian cup qualifier next tuesday.  it s something we ve always done,  said one fan who has attended games for the past few years, including two world cup qualifiers between hong kong and china in 2015 that drew jeers from the crowd.  it s a kind of resentment toward china that comes through ... there are several hundred of us and it s become a tradition now. we ll keep doing it.  the hong kong football association (hkfa) was warned by the asian football confederation (afc) recently over the conduct of fans who booed the chinese anthem, and said  a repeat violation may result in more severe punishment . asked for comment, the afc didn t specifically address a question on whether they d been pressed by china to punish hong kong, but said a review of video evidence found fans guilty of  improper conduct  under the afc s disciplinary and ethics code. hong kong s leader, carrie lam, has suggested the law would be enacted in the current legislative year, and not be applied retrospectively   which would mean fans who jeer before it becomes law locally shouldn t face prosecution.  people should not excessively worry about unwittingly committing an offense. these worries are unnecessary,  lam told reporters.  i don t see this as having any connection to ... freedom of expression. but this has highlighted a recent trend in hong kong that whenever there is anything related to hong kong and chinese affairs ... some people cause panic and unnecessary fear.

" after five months of crippling conflict, there are slow signs of life returning in the philippines  battered marawi city. utilities engineers were at work on thursday in the near deserted outskirts of marawi which escaped the daily air strikes that flattened vast swathes of the city. a few groceries, motorcycle repair shops and gasoline sellers have opened, ready for the first batch of returning residents in the coming days. nearly 6,500 families will be headed back to the homes that were left intact, out of the 353,000 people displaced when hundreds of pro islamic state gunmen ran amok and seized control of central marawi in may. combat operations ended on monday, when the last fighters were killed in a fierce final stand. with vehicles crushed and overturned and buildings reduced to skeletons of mangled steel and rubble, the city appears to be in the aftermath of a war that lasted years, rather than months. amelah ampaso said she decided that day to sneak back to marawi and reopen her shop, now stocked with cooking oil and cigarettes and offering photocopying services, printing, and haircuts. as a first mover in a liberated marawi, the 25 year old is doing brisk business among the few people around.  the other shops are closed, so people are coming here,  she said.  it s safe again.  but nearby streets look like the set of a post apocalyptic film, silent, with shutters pulled down and weeds growing between concrete slabs. rust and decay is setting in after months of heavy rains and neglect. spray painted on the walls of almost every building is the word  clear , marking where police and soldiers went house to house checking thousands of abandoned properties for booby traps or signs of insurgents hiding. the fighting has taken a heavy toll, killing more than 1,100 people, mostly militants, and reducing a large part of the interior of the city to piles of rubble, leaving only shells of uninhabitable gray buildings. shop owner madid noor, 64, returned two months into the battle, reassured by detachments of soldiers and police nearby, and unperturbed by what were constant explosions and the howling of fighter jets over the city. after a few lean months, he hopes returnees will come to him to buy washing powder, petrol and fake branded sportswear.  some days we have customers. but not every day,  he said.

" christmas came early for u.s. gun shop owners   who saw a rush of firearms purchases ahead of the presidential election   but they may now be hard pressed to match last year’s record holiday sales. gun merchants had a record october, federal background check data shows, as gun enthusiasts snapped up pistols and rifles on fears that democrat hillary clinton would win the white house and seek to restrict ownership.  traffic has fallen off substantially since republican donald trump, a gun rights supporter, won the presidency on nov. 8. shares of smith & wesson holding corp swhc.o are down 15 percent since then, despite a rebound this week, while sturm ruger & company’s (rgr.n) stock is 17 percent lower. like most other retailers, gun sellers thrive during the holidays. last year’s black friday featured record activity for a single day, according background check data.  december 2015 was the second busiest month ever, topped only by december 2012, when president barack obama threatened to rein in gun rights after a deranged man killed 26 people, including 20 children, in a shooting rampage at sandy hook elementary school in newtown, connecticut. obama, a democrat, never enacted any sweeping new gun restrictions because he faced opposition in a republican controlled congress. now, with this year’s black friday just days away, gun dealers say traffic is regaining momentum after the post election drop. “i’m not expecting it to be any slower than our normal black friday,” said kellie weeks, owner of georgia gun store in gainesville, georgia. “but if hillary had won, we would have sold out already.”  after obama was elected in 2008, november background checks jumped 48 percent compared to the prior november, according to background check data from the national shooting sports foundation. by comparison, checks rose a more modest 5 percent in november 2004 after republican george w. bush was re elected. such checks are the best proxy for data on gun sales, which gun manufacturers do not publicly release. the foundation strips the data of applications for conceal carry permits   typically made by people who already own guns   to give a better reflection of actual purchases.  through october 2016, background checks are up 15 percent compared to the same amount of time last year, suggesting another a strong year of overall sales. wall street expects smith & wesson’s revenue to increase 28 percent in 2016 and 11 percent next year, according to thomson reuters data. the springfield, massachusetts, company reports its october quarter results on december 1. even after the recent selloff, smith & wesson’s stock is up 10 percent in 2016, better than the s&p 500’s 7 percent rise. gilbert’s gun shop in frankfort, kentucky, expects to sell fewer high capacity magazines over the holidays because customers no longer fear they will be banned. but the shop and other gun stores consulted by reuters remain hopeful that demand for newly launched compact and target pistols will help spur a busy holiday season. “some categories might be light,” he said. “but in general, sales through black friday and christmas, i still think will be very strong.” ",0
" the u.s. house of representatives on monday failed to approve a bill to allow the federal aviation administration to continue to operate and a package of tax relief bills to aid hurricane victims after ranking democrats objected. authorization for the faa is set to expire on saturday. the bill would have extended the agency for another six months as congress debates whether to privatize the country’s air traffic control system and considers new airline passenger protections. the bill, which was considered under fast track rules that require two thirds of members to support it, failed on a 245 to 171 margin. house democratic leaders on monday had urged their colleagues to oppose the measure, citing republican’s decision to only extend some healthcare programs and refusing to allow immigration legislation. “democrats support reauthorization of the faa, which is long overdue as a result of republicans’ failure to craft a bill that can obtain bipartisan majority support,” the statement said. “it is outrageous that the majority is hijacking the must pass faa bill as a vehicle for its pet priorities.” house majority leader kevin mccarthy said in a statement after the vote the house will take up the issue again. “it didn’t take long for democrats to snap back into their partisan corner. the american people can’t stand this nonsense,” mccarthy said. president donald trump in march proposed handing over control of u.s. air traffic control to a privately operated board, but has faced resistance among democrats and owners of private planes.  major u.s. carriers, including american airlines, united airlines, southwest airlines and jetblue airways, all back the privatization proposal. the bill would have also extended three healthcare programs, but would not extend a children’s healthcare program and community health centers that are set to expire on saturday, which is the end of the budget year. democrats want to force a vote to reverse trump’s decision to overturn an obama administration order shielding from deportation immigrants who came to the united states illegally as children. the bill would make it easier for people with hurricane losses to write them off on their taxes, eliminating a requirement that personal losses must exceed 10 percent of adjusted gross income to qualify for a deduction. it would also give hurricane victims penalty free access to retirement funds and temporarily suspends limitations on the deduction for charitable contributions to hurricane relief made before year end. the bill provides a tax credit for 40 percent of wages, up to $6,000 per employee, paid by a disaster affected employer in certain disaster areas.

" a row over how much money britain should pay the european union when it leaves the bloc will probably go on for the full duration of the eu exit talks, brexit minister david davis said on tuesday. the brexit bill is a contentious issue both in britain, where eurosceptics are keen to see as little money paid as possible, and in the eu, which is demanding britain meets its existing commitments to the bloc.   my expectation is that the money argument will go on for the full duration of the negotiation,  he told parliament.  britain, which began a two year negotiating period in march, has said it is prepared to meet its international obligations and, last week, davis said london was willing to offer more than the bare legal minimum.  the bill is one of three issues the eu is demanding progress on before it is willing to begin discussing britain s future relationship with the bloc   something london is keen to move on to as soon as possible. but, davis stressed that britain would not be pressured into cutting a deal just to move talks to the next stage.  davis said the two sides disagreed over the basis of the so called brexit bill, and that he did not expect them to fully resolve their differences.  it is clear that the two sides have very different legal stances,  davis told parliament during an update on the talks.  (eu chief negotiator) michel barnier and i agreed that we do not anticipate making incremental progress on the final shape of the financial deal in every round ... it is also clear there are significant differences to be bridged in this sector.   davis also said that there was widespread agreement across the european union about having an implementation period when britain leaves the bloc, and that it would probably look to continue its relationship with the european investment bank.

" a 96 year old former paramedic at the auschwitz nazi death camp is no longer fit to stand trial due to his dementia, a spokesman for the court said on tuesday, bringing to an end one of germany s last prosecutions linked to the holocaust. hubert zafke worked as a paramedic in auschwitz for one month starting on aug. 15, 1944. he stood accused of being an accessory to the murder of at least 3,681 people at the concentration and extermination camp in nazi occupied poland. during his time at auschwitz, at least 14 deportation trains arrived there from places as far away as lyon, vienna and westerbork in the netherlands.     although zafke was not accused of having been directly involved in any killings, the prosecution s office said he was aware of the camp s function as a facility for mass murder. the trial against zafke began in the northeastern town of neubrandenburg in 2016 but was repeatedly delayed due to his ill health. germany had faced criticism for not prosecuting those who were small cogs in the nazi machine and did not actively take part in the killing of 6 million jews during the holocaust. that criticism has abated thanks to many recent trials and convictions, such as the 2011 conviction of sobibor extermination camp guard john demjanjuk, which gave prosecutors new legal means to investigate suspects under accessory to murder charges. former auschwitz guard reinhold hanning and oskar groening, known as the  bookkeeper of auschwitz , have also been convicted of complicity in mass murder in recent years. another case against a woman who worked as a radio operator at auschwitz was dropped last year after a court in kiel ruled she was unfit to stand trial.

" the top u.s. senate democrat said on friday he would force a vote on the federal communications commission’s decision to repeal landmark net neutrality rules, but the move was unlikely to block a ruling that could reshape the digital landscape. the fcc voted thursday along party lines to reverse the obama era rules barring internet service providers from blocking or throttling internet traffic, or offering paid fast lanes. a group of state attorneys general vowed to sue. on friday, senator charles schumer of new york said he would force a vote on the fcc action under the congressional review act. republicans scuttled internet privacy rules adopted under the obama administration using the same procedural vehicle. “there will be a vote to repeal the rule that the fcc passed. it’s in our power to do that,” schumer said in new york. “sometimes we don’t like them, when they used it to repeal some of the pro environmental regulations, but now we can use the cra to our benefit and we intend to.” senate majority leader mitch mcconnell opposes schumer’s effort and backed the fcc repeal, a spokesman for the republican said friday. a reversal of thursday’s fcc vote would need the approval of the senate, u.s. house and president donald trump. trump also backed the fcc action, the white house said thursday. this week’s fcc order grants internet providers sweeping new powers to block, throttle or discriminate among internet content, but requires public disclosure of those practices. internet providers have vowed not to change how consumers get online content. the fcc rules also seek to bar states from imposing their own net neutrality requirements. the fcc said the rules would take effect once the white house office of management and budget approved the new transparency rules, which could take several months. democrats say net neutrality is essential to protect consumers, while republicans say the rules hindered investment by providers and were not needed. moody’s investors service said in a note friday the fcc vote was “credit positive” for internet service providers that could have faced rate regulation under the 2015 rules that would have treated them like public utilities. moody’s said providers “will tread lightly when it comes to engaging in paid prioritization and throttling, as there could be significant negative public reaction to these acts.” moody’s said “at least in the near term, the cost of negative publicity on their existing businesses far outweighs the benefit of additional revenue streams these companies can generate from paid prioritization agreements.” ",0

" the mediator of u.n. led syrian peace talks in geneva will assess next week whether either side is trying to sabotage the process, he said on thursday, after president bashar al assad s negotiators said they would turn up five days late.  we shall assess the behavior of both sides, government and opposition, in geneva,  u.n. envoy staffan de mistura said.  and based on that we will then decide how this... can be a building up or not, or a sabotage of geneva.  if either side were seen to be sabotaging the process it could have  a very bad impact on any other political attempt to have processes elsewhere,  he said. he said the geneva rounds of talks were the only peace process backed by the u.n. security council, although there were many other initiatives being planned. he did not elaborate, but russian president vladimir putin, who is seeking re election next year, has suggested holding a  syrian congress  in the russian city of sochi early in 2018. diplomats see putin s plan as a bid to draw a line under the war after seven years of fighting and to celebrate russia s role as the power that tipped the balance of the war and became the key player in the peace process. opposition negotiator basma kodmani told reporters the government side had wasted the chance for a week of direct negotiations, while the opposition was doing all it could.    i think we are showing, through our presence, our behavior, the number of documents we have submitted, the issues we are raising with the u.n., that we are here for a very constructive engagement with the united nations, and that we have no partner so far to talk to,  she said.   they are physically not here.  the absence of the government delegation, led by chief negotiator bashar al ja afari, has effectively halted a peace process which has made little progress in eight rounds. the latest round began last week with de mistura hoping to discuss an agenda including constitutional and electoral reform. but ja afari arrived a day late and left after two days, saying the opposition had  mined the road  to the talks by insisting that assad could not play any interim role in syria s political transition. the delegation returned to damascus to  consult and refresh , but ja afari initially threatened not to come back, which the opposition said would be  an embarrassment to russia . de mistura said on thursday that ja afari s delegation had confirmed it would return on sunday, five days later than expected, for another stretch of talks lasting until dec. 15.

" u.s. secretary of state rex tillerson has recused himself from issues related to transcanada corp’s application for a permit for the keystone xl pipeline, the state department said in a letter on thursday to the environmental group greenpeace. “he has not worked on that matter at the department of state, and will play no role in the deliberations or ultimate resolution of transcanada’s application,” said the letter from katherine mcmanus, the state department’s deputy legal adviser. mcmanus’ letter came after greenpeace wrote to officials at the state department and the office of government ethics on wednesday, urging tillerson recuse himself from any decisions on the multibillion dollar pipeline, given his former role as chief executive officer of exxon mobil corp.. greenpeace argued in its letter that exxon mobil would “directly and predictably” benefit from the approval of keystone xl because the firm has investments in canadian oil sands. tillerson recused himself from the matter in early february, mcmanus wrote. transcanada tried for more than five years to build the 1,179 mile (1,897 km) pipeline, until president barack obama rejected it in 2015. transcanada resubmitted its application for the keystone project in january, after obama’s white house successor, donald trump, signed an order smoothing its path. the line is designed to link existing pipeline networks in canada and the united states to bring crude from alberta and north dakota to refineries in illinois en route to the gulf of mexico. exxon has a majority stake in imperial oil, a calgary,  alberta based company that operates the kearl oil sands project in northern alberta. “exxon mobil could benefit from the approval of the pipeline if it has specific contracts or agreements with transcanada either to transport their canadian tar sands production, or to receive such shipments at their u.s. refineries,” greenpeace wrote in its letter on wednesday. tillerson wrote in a january letter to mcmanus that for one year after his resignation from exxon mobil, he “will not participate personally and substantially in any particular matter involving specific parties in which i know that exxon mobil is a party or represents a party, unless i am first authorized to participate.” he also wrote that “on a case by case basis,” he would recuse himself “from participation in any particular matter involving specific parties in which i determine that a reasonable person with knowledge of the relevant facts would question my impartiality in the matter, unless i am first authorized to participate.” ",0
" the disclosure this week of documents describing secret cia hacking tools shows that intensified u.s. government efforts to prevent leaks by intelligence agency employees and contractors have largely failed, cyber security professionals and intelligence officials say. if the central intelligence agency disclosures are confirmed to be the work of an intelligence agency contractor, as government investigators currently suspect, it would be at least the third public case in recent years in which special software and human resources programs intended to catch so called insider threats have not  worked. the anti secrecy group wikileaks, which published the cia documents tuesday, said it obtained the archive after it circulated among former u.s. government contractors in “an unauthorized manner.”  part of the problem in combating leaks is that the number of government employees and contractors with access to highly sensitive information has exploded in recent years, due in part to greater information sharing across the government that was mandated in the wake of the sept. 11, 2001, attacks.  budget constraints that force agencies to rely on contractors rather than permanent staff have also contributed to the problem, intelligence officials say. government estimates of how many people have been granted top secret clearances range from the high hundreds of thousands to more than a million across thousands of public agencies and private companies. government agencies estimate that there is one insider threat for every 6,000 to 8,000 employees, an intelligence agency contractor said, speaking on condition of anonymity for fear of upsetting his employer. the contractor said there is too much sharing of information internally, with many workers having access to material they do not need. recognizing the dangers, former president barack obama signed an executive order creating the national insider threat task force in 2011, following the disclosures of hundreds of thousands of state department cables that were stolen by former army private chelsea manning and provided to wikileaks.  the order covered virtually every federal department and agency, including the department of education, the peace corps and other offices not directly involved in national security. the program requires federal employees to monitor co workers for suspicious actions based on behavioral profiling. those who fail to report high risk people or behaviors could face penalties, including criminal charges. insider threat investigations can also be launched when computer network monitoring detects “suspicious user behavior,” according to government documents. monitoring of prospective and current government employees has only increased in recent years. under a directive issued in may 2016 by james clapper, the former director of national intelligence, u.s. officials evaluating whether employees should continue to have access to classified information can collect publicly available social media posts of those workers. despite the new initiatives and a raft of innovative employee monitoring technologies developed by the nsa and private sector tech companies, insider threats remain “the greatest worry across government and industry,” said curtis dukes, the former head of cyber defense at the national security agency who now works at the center for internet security, a non profit organization committed to protecting against cyber threats. tuesday’s leaks came at a time when u.s. intelligence agencies were already reeling from the discovery that former contractor harold martin had allegedly spent 20 years stealing secrets from the nsa and three other intelligence agencies before finally being caught last summer. martin worked for booz allen hamilton, the same consulting firm that employed edward snowden, who in 2013 exposed details about u.s. spying programs. this week’s dump of cia files is especially alarming because the spy agency is considered the “gold standard” for monitoring and tracking insiders, according to larry pfeiffer, chief of staff to then cia director michael hayden. leo taddeo, chief security officer at cryptzone and a former special agent with the federal bureau of investigation’s cyber crime division in new york, said the sept. 11 attacks prompted a significant expansion in the number of facilities and government contractors who had access to sensitive information. a 2003 report on the attacks concluded the plot could have been disrupted if not for lapses of communication between the cia and fbi. that finding and others forced a restructuring of how u.s. intelligence agencies share information, overcoming resistance by some officials who worried the new arrangement could create new problems. “we need for the right people to see the right dots, so they can connect them, but the counter argument is you increase the insider risk and that compromise has a greater impact,” taddeo said. chris inglis, former deputy director of the nsa, gave a presentation entitled “how to catch a snowden” to a jam packed room last month at the rsa cyber security conference in san francisco. the talk was so popular that conference organizers had inglis present twice. inglis said companies, as well as governments, need to embrace continuous monitoring of employees and the use of behavioral analytics to spot potential leakers, and to directly involve human resources departments in detection efforts. some companies have been hesitant to adopt such strategies, inglis said, but a raft of breaches in recent years has led to a growing embrace of more aggressive approaches. “the unfortunate truth is you’re only going to suffer this one in a million times, but that one in a million can

" u.s. senator bernie sanders returned to washington for meetings on thursday with president barack obama and senate minority leader harry reid as democrats pressured him to end his presidential campaign and support hillary clinton after a hard fought primary race. clinton, a former secretary of state, u.s. senator and first lady, secured enough delegates to secure the democratic nomination this week and become the first woman to lead a major u.s. party as its presidential nominee. despite clinton’s commanding victories in california and new jersey in presidential contests on tuesday, sanders vowed to carry his populist campaign to the democratic national convention in july, when the party’s nominee is formally chosen. obama, who is expected to endorse clinton soon, was scheduled to meet with sanders at the white house on thursday at 11:15 a.m. (1515 gmt). sanders will meet with reid, his senate colleague, in the afternoon. the sanders campaign, which waged an unexpectedly strong challenge to a better known and better funded democrat, has decried what it called clinton’s anointment by the party establishment and the media. in an interview taped on wednesday for broadcast on the nbc’s “tonight” show on thursday, obama said he hoped that divisions between democrats would start to heal in coming weeks now that clinton has clinched the party’s nomination for the nov. 8 presidential election. at a fund raiser in new york city on wednesday, obama said he was not too worried about bruised feelings after the primary and said “it was a healthy thing for the democratic party to have a contested primary.” obama praised sanders, the democratic socialist senator from vermont, for bringing new energy and ideas to the party. “he pushed the party and challenged them,” he said. “i thought it made hillary a better candidate.” democrats are striking a delicate balance between the need to unite behind clinton in the looming battle against presumptive republican nominee donald trump and not alienating sanders and his supporters. u.s. senator elizabeth warren, herself a progressive known as a fiery critic of wall street, is preparing to endorse clinton in the coming weeks after staying neutral in the democratic primary, people familiar with her thinking told reuters.

"in what amounts to an 11th hour  gift  by the outgoing obama administration to tehran s leadership to keep the country, which on sunday was involved in yet another shooting incident with a us destroyer, content and compliant with obama s landmark  nuclear deal , the ap reported that iran is to receive a huge shipment of natural uranium from russia to compensate it for exporting tons of reactor coolant. the move was approved by the outgoing u.s. administration and other governments  seeking to keep tehran committed to a landmark nuclear pact. ap cites two senior diplomats who said that the transfer which was recently agreed by the u.s. and five other world powers that negotiated the nuclear deal with iran, foresees delivery of 116 metric tons (nearly 130 tons) of natural uranium. u.n. security council approval is needed but a formality, considering five of those powers are permanent security council members, they said. the swap is in compensation for the approximately 40 metric tons (44 tons) of heavy water exported by iran to russia since the nuclear agreement went into effect. another 30 metric tons have gone to the u.s. and oman.while uranium can be enriched to levels ranging from reactor fuel or medical and research purposes to the core of an atomic bomb, iran has claimed it has no interest in such weapons and its activities are being closely monitored under the nuclear pact to make sure they remain peaceful. as we reported at the time, tehran previously received a similar amount of natural uranium in 2015 as part of negotiations leading up to the nuclear deal, in a swap for enriched uranium it sent to russia. but the new shipment will be the first such consignment since the deal came into force a year ago.the news comes ahead of a meeting in vienna, where representatives of iran, the united states, russia, china, britain, france and germany will review iranian complaints that the u.s. was reneging on sanctions relief pledges included in the nuclear deal.as ap adds,  the uranium agreement comes at a sensitive time. with the incoming u.s. administration and many u.s. lawmakers already skeptical of how effective the nuclear deal is in keeping iran s nuclear program peaceful over the long term, they might view it as further evidence that tehran is being given too many concessions. tehran s nuclear activities start to expire in less than a decade. the troubling part, if only for those who see iran as hell bent on creating nucleaar weapons was noted by david albright, whose institute of science and international security often briefs u.s. lawmakers on iran s nuclear program, says the shipment could be enriched to enough weapons-grade uranium for more than 10 simple nuclear bombs,  depending on the efficiency of the enrichment process and the design of the nuclear weapon. while it remains to be seen if trump will comment on the unexpected delivery, we are certain that israel, and especially its embattled prime minister netanyahu, will raise a substantial fuss over the renewed possibility of a nuclear-armed neighbor. heavy water is used to cool a type of reactor that produces more plutonium than reactors cooled by light water. like enriched uranium, plutonium can be turned into the fissile core of a nuclear weaponmeanwhile, reuters reports that iranian lawmakers, far from demilitarizing, approved plans on monday to expand military spending to five percent of the budget, including developing the country s long-range missile program which u.s. president-elect donald trump has pledged to halt. the vote is a boost to iran s military establishment   the regular army, the elite islamic revolutionary guard corps (irgc) and defense ministry   which was allocated almost 2 percent of the 2015-16 budget. but it could put the islamic republic on a collision course with the incoming trump administration, and fuel criticism from other western states which say tehran s recent ballistic missile tests are inconsistent with a u.n. resolution on iran. the resolution, adopted last year as part of the deal to curb iran s nuclear activities, calls on iran to refrain from work on ballistic missiles designed to deliver nuclear weapons. tehran says it has not carried out any work on missiles specifically designed to carry such payloads.the obama administration says iran s ballistic missile tests have not violated the nuclear agreement with tehran, but trump, who criticized the accord as  the worst deal ever negotiated , has said he would stop iran s missile program. those ballistic missiles, with a range of 1,250 miles, were designed to intimidate not only israel   but also intended to frighten europe and someday maybe hit even the united states,  he told the american israel public affairs committee aipac in march.  we re not going to let that happen. so one hand, we have obama desperate to salvage his diplomatic legacy (having already seen tpp implode and obamacare starting the repeal proess), appeasing iran in every possible way, even if it means further antagonizing israel; on the other we have iran taking advantage of obama s weakness, and accelerating the ballistic weapons program which has been banned per the same treasury that obama wants to see continue. finally, throw in trump and netanyahu in the mix, and the future for us-iranian relations after january 20 suddenly looks rather volatile.  zero hedge",1
"you can blame the escalating debt on obamacare and taxes we can thank obama for this the federal government will be flirting with $30 trillion in debt within a decade, the congressional budget office reported monday, blaming an aging population, new spending and tax cuts approved on capitol hill, and the growing burden from obamacare for erasing the progress washington had made over the past few years.analysts said obamacare will chase more workers out of the labor force over the next five years, adding pressure to an economy still struggling to spring to life more than seven years into the obama recovery.the affordable care act itself is still struggling to attract a customer base, the cbo said, lowering its estimate for the number of people who will sign up for the exchanges from 21 million to 13 million   a drop of nearly 40 percent in projections. customers collecting taxpayer subsidies this year will be 11 million, down from the 15 million the cbo projected a year ago.the grim news comes with less than a year left for president obama to put the law on firmer footing as he seeks to head off what is likely to be a last effort at repealing the act after november s elections.the economic front is somewhat brighter for mr. obama, who seven years into the recovery will finally see significant sustained growth of 2.5 percent this year and 2.6 percent next year, the cbo said.that will be followed by a cooling off, with growth dropping below 2 percent in 2019 and 2020. the economic gains will continue to go disproportionately to the wealthy, helping boost income tax revenue but limiting payroll taxes, which will put even more pressure on the entitlement programs that are driving up deficits.the biggest fiscal dent, however, was made late last year when mr. obama and the republican-run congress struck a deal. the president won significant spending hikes, and republicans insisted on a new round of special tax breaks that, combined, reversed years of progress and added nearly $750 billion to projected deficits over the next decade. after six consecutive years in which the deficit has declined relative to the size of the economy, this year s deficit   at 2.9 percent of gross domestic product (gdp)   is anticipated to increase for the first time since it peaked at 9.8 percent in 2009,  the cbo said.deficits will continue to rise over the next 10 years, topping $1 trillion again in 2022 and reaching $1.4 trillion in 2026, the analysts said.the accumulation of those deficits will deepen the gross public debt from $18.1 trillion at the end of 2015 to $29.3 trillion in 2026. by contrast, the debt stood at $10.6 trillion when mr. obama took office in 2009.looking decades into the future, the picture only gets worse, the cbo said.read more: wt",1
" the trump administration must decide by the end of this month whether to grant belarus continued relief from u.s. economic sanctions despite a stiff government crackdown on street demonstrations last month. the renewal decision is considered a low level priority for the administration, which is facing bigger questions about u.s. relations with russia and china, and with most major diplomatic positions still unfilled. but whether the united states renews the sanctions relief or instead returns to blacklisting nine major belarus companies is an early test for the trump administration on the importance it puts on human rights versus efforts to coax countries in russia’s orbit to turn to the west. the sanctions waivers, which began in 2015 and were extended twice last year, were tied to domestic political reforms and intended to encourage belarus, which has long historical ties to russia, to move closer to the european union and the united states. now, however, u.s. officials are alarmed by the arrests of hundreds of people last month during an attempt to hold a street protest in the capital minsk, and concerned if continuing sanctions relief could be seen as ignoring the crackdown. belarus authorities last month raided a human rights group’s offices and used violence against peaceful protesters, rights groups say. “this most recent crackdown sharpened people’s focus,” said a u.s. congressional aide, speaking on the condition of anonymity. “now there is a real question about whether or not they (the sanctions) should be reimposed.” the decision must be taken by the end of april. if the administration makes no decision, the sanctions will be re imposed. nato members, including poland and the baltic states, feel threatened by what they see as increased russian intervention in europe, including moscow’s annexation of ukraine’s crimea region in 2014. “belarus is so important from a strategic point of view and it’s so dependent economically on russia that we are really very concerned,” said piotr wilczek, the polish ambassador to the united states. “belarus is becoming more and more part of this wider russian problem we have.” the trump administration is inclined to renew the sanctions relief, but likely would wait until the last minute “to make sure they don’t do anything awful,” said a u.s. official, also speaking on condition of anonymity. state and treasury department officials declined to comment in detail on the belarus sanctions. the belarus ministry of foreign affairs declined to comment. president george w. bush in 2006 blacklisted top belarus officials, including president alexander lukashenko, for undermining the country’s democratic processes or human rights abuses. the united states later added large belarus companies to the sanctions list. but in 2015, lukashenko released political prisoners and indicated he was open to better relations with the west. that october, president barack obama temporarily lifted sanctions on nine belarus companies, including petrochemical conglomerate belneftekhim and tire manufacturer belshina.  now, however, lukashenko appears to be keeping his country firmly in moscow’s orbit. in a letter to him last week, four u.s. senators said they were concerned over the crackdown and that he decided to allow russia to conduct “provocative” military exercises in belarus later this year.

" israel s supreme court ruled on thursday that the state could not keep the bodies of palestinian gunmen for use as bargaining chips to get back its own dead unless it enacted legislation permitting it to do so. a three justice panel ruled in favor of militants  families who petitioned to force israeli authorities to return to them for burial the bodies of militant relatives killed in attacks on israelis. the court gave the state six months to enact legislation if it wanted to keep the bodies.  israel has said it was holding the bodies to help it effect the return the remains of the two israeli soldiers killed in the gaza strip in 2014 and two israeli civilians, whose whereabouts are unknown and whom israel believes are alive and being held in the enclave by palestinian islamist group hamas. but in a majority ruling, the court said the bodies were being held without authorization because there was no law on the israeli statute books to regulate their being kept.  it should be emphasized that israel, a state governed by the rule of law, cannot hold bodies for the purposes of negotiations while there is no specific, clear law in place permitting it to do so,  part of the ruling s summary said. israel has in the past carried out swaps of prisoners and of militants  remains with hamas and with the iranian backed lebanese group hezbollah in exchange for israeli soldiers and their remains.

" callista gingrich, wife of the former speaker of the u.s. house of representatives, on friday became u.s. ambassador to the vatican, which is at odds with washington over immigration, climate change and jerusalem. callista gingrich, 51, an author, documentary filmmaker and former congressional aide, presented her credentials to pope francis at the vatican to officially assume her role. her husband newt gingrich was an early supporter and vocal ally of u.s. president donald trump. newt gingrich is expected to continue his role as a political contributor to fox news from his new base in rome. trump s nomination of callista gingrich to the post at the holy see in may caused some controversy because of her marriage to gingrich, with whom she became involved when he was still married to his second wife. both are roman catholic. on thursday they attended the funeral at the vatican of cardinal bernard law, who resigned as archbishop of boston 15 years ago after covering up years of sexual abuse of children by priests.  the pope has implicitly criticized trump s decision to pull out of the paris accord on climate change. he said last month that denying climate change or being indifferent to its effects were  perverse attitudes  that blocked research and dialogue aimed at protecting the future of the planet. francis is also opposed to trump s decision to recognize jerusalem as israel s capital. the pontiff has called for respect for the city s  status quo,  saying new tension in the middle east would further inflame world conflicts.. on thursday at the united nations, where the vatican has permanent observer status, more than 120 countries defied trump and voted in favor of a resolution calling for the united states to drop its recent recognition. the u.s. embassy said in a statement that the new ambassador  looks forward to working with the holy see to defend human rights, advance religious freedom, combat human trafficking, and to seek peaceful solutions to crises around the world .

" the trump administration had a simple but stark message for world financial leaders who gathered in washington on thursday amid worries about rising u.s. protectionism: fair trade means tit for tat tariffs. speaking to bankers just hours after the formal start of the international monetary fund and world bank spring meetings, white house national economic council director gary cohn said washington was prepared to get tougher in the trade arena. “if you want to insist on having a tariff on a product   which we prefer you not   the president believes that we should treat you in a reciprocal fashion and that we should tax your product coming into the united states,” cohn said. “that is free, that is open, and that is fair.” asked at the institute of international finance about his message for his international counterparts, cohn said the united states doesn’t want to be “taken advantage of” any more.   “the message is simple. we care about the united states of america, we care about economic prosperity, we care about economic growth, we care about trade, we care about being treated fairly,” he said. earlier at the white house, president donald trump signed a directive to study whether steel imports into the united states should be restricted for national security reasons under a law passed in 1962. such moves, including a review of “buy american” rules launched earlier this week, have raised concerns that the trump administration is looking outside the world trade organization for remedies to restrict u.s. imports. imf managing director christine lagarde told reporters on thursday that more needed to be done to make the global trading system fairer and expressed a willingness to work with trump to do just that. in a news conference, lagarde said there was a need to improve the wto dispute settlement rules as well as reduce government subsidies for industry and tackle other trade distortions. she said the imf would do its part in working to cut government subsidies for industry and other trade practices that limit competition, but said “protectionist measures” needed to be avoided. “from the various contacts that i’ve had with the (trump)  administration so far, i have every reason to believe that we will make progress, that we will cooperate all together in order to support and indeed improve the system as we have it,” lagarde said. the imf also has expressed concerns about the trump administration’s plan to cut taxes, releasing reports on wednesday that said such a move could fuel financial risk taking and increase public debt. appearing alongside cohn, u.s. treasury secretary steven mnuchin said he would unveil the tax plan “soon, very soon,” and predicted it would be passed by congress this year.  but he gave few details and shed no light on whether the plan would include a controversial border tax component. “it will be sweeping, it will be significant and it will create a lot of economic growth,” mnuchin said. “the plan will pay for itself with growth.” separately, world bank president jim yong kim also put in a plug for free trade and said he was “encouraged” by his engagement so far with trump. but he added that he would not reduce the multilateral lender’s commitment to trade or to financing alternative energy projects.  “the science of climate change didn’t change with any particular election, and i don’t see that it will,” kim said at a news conference. “we have to be an evidence based organization.”    the imf and world bank meetings come about a month after mnuchin insisted that an anti protectionism pledge be dropped from a group of 20 communique issued in baden baden, germany. eswar prasad, former head of the imf’s china department, said the trump administration may choose to simply ignore the advice of the imf and other institutions.  “the imf has little leverage since its limited toolkit of analysis based advice, persuasion, and peer pressure is unlikely to have much of an impact on this administration’s policies,” said prasad, now an international trade professor at cornell university. mnuchin’s decision against naming china a currency manipulator last week removed one concern for the imf ahead of the meetings.

"lost in the uproar over the nfl sideline protests against police brutality are newly released statistics showing that the threat to black men is skyrocketing   not from trigger-happy or racist cops, but from crime.more than any other demographic group, black men are paying the price with their lives with a surging violent crime rate over the past two years, including a 20 percent jump in the overall homicide rate, even as the number of blacks killed by police declines.using homicide figures from the 2016 fbi uniform crime report released sept. 25, manhattan institute fellow heather mac donald found that the number of black homicide victims has jumped by nearly 900 per year since the black lives matter movement took root in 2014. the majority of victims of that homicide surge have been black,  ms. mac donald said in an email.  they were killed overwhelmingly by black criminals, not by the police and not by whites. meanwhile, the number of blacks killed by police dipped from 259 in 2015 to 233 in 2016, with 2017 so far coming in below both years with 175 deaths as of oct. 12, according to the washington post s fatal force database.ms. mac donald and others have blamed the increasingly hands-off approach of police officers who are worried about running afoul of the black lives matter movement after the 2014 shooting of 18-year-old michael brown in ferguson, missouri. she dubbed it  the ferguson effect. peter moskos, associate professor at the john jay college of criminal justice in new york city, tracked the same phenomenon in baltimore after the april 2015 rioting over the death of a black man in police custody. he calls it  the freddie gray effect.  he found a spike in homicides and shootings after the riots, which were followed by baltimore state s attorney marilyn mosby s decision to charge six officers in gray s death. three of the officers were acquitted in non-jury trials, and charges against the other three were dismissed. police were instructed   both by city leaders and then in the odd doj report city leaders asked for   to be less proactive since such policing will disproportionately affect minorities,  mr. moskos said in a sept. 4 post.  few seem to care that minorities are disproportionately affected by the rise in murder. officers also have been hit: ms. mac donald said there was a 53 percent increase in 2016 in the shooting deaths of cops, while the washington post database found that only 16 of the 233 black men killed by police in 2016 were unarmed. a police officer is 18 times more likely to be killed by a black male than an unarmed black male is to be killed by a police officer,  ms. mac donald said.  black males have made up 42 percent of all cop killers over the past decade, though they are only 6 percent of the population. those involved with black lives matter have said in the past that prosecuting such killings is easier than cases involving police force against civilians.while the nfl kneeling began as a protest against police brutality, those involved have increasingly expanded the point to encompass what san francisco 49ers safety eric reid described as  systemic oppression that has been rampant in this country for decades and decades. rashad robinson, senior campaign director at color of change, said president trump s recent suggestion that owners should fire players who refuse to stand for the national anthem represents a view within sports that  black people serve at the pleasure of white people. almost every nfl owner is white. nearly 70% of players are black,  mr. robinson said in a written statement.  yet for donald trump, this power imbalance is not enough   he wants to be sure that players who exercise their right to protest social injustice can be fired with impunity. this is what it means to advance a white supremacist worldview.   washington times",1
" u.s. president elect donald trump offered to help solve pakistan’s problems and praised prime minister nawaz sharif as a  “terrific guy” in the first call between the two men, the pakistani leader’s office said. historical allies in the region, islamabad and washington have seen relations sour in recent years over u.s. accusations that pakistan shelters islamist militants, a charge denied by the south asian nation. sharif’s office said late on wednesday the pakistani premier called trump to congratulate him on his victory and issued a read out of the call. trump’s team confirmed the two men talked and issued a brief statement. “president trump said prime minister nawaz sharif you have a very good reputation. you are a terrific guy. you are doing amazing work which is visible in every way,” said the statement issued by sharif’s office. “i am ready and willing to play any role that you want me to play to address and find solutions to the outstanding problems. it will be an honor and i will personally do it.” the prime minister’s office did not elaborate on the kind of problems trump offered to solve. the statement also did not clarify why exactly trump was impressed with sharif. pakistan’s sputtering economy has rebounded since sharif was elected in 2013 and security has vastly improved amid greater efforts by the army to tackle militants such as the pakistani taliban. but security remains a problem as islamist groups continue to stage mass attacks and islamic state radicals have sought to gain a foothold inside pakistan, claiming responsibility for several high profile attacks. the economy is also facing acute challenges, including energy shortages. trump’s office said the two leaders had a “productive conversation about how the united states and pakistan will have a strong working relationship in the future”.  “president elect trump also noted that he is looking forward to a lasting and strong personal relationship with prime minister sharif,” the statement added. detailing the conversation, sharif’s office added that trump told the pakistani premier to feel free to call him any time before he assumes office on january 20.  “as i am talking to you prime minister, i feel i am talking to a person i have known for long,” the statement added, paraphrasing trump’s comments. sharif’s office often releases read outs of his conversations with foreign heads of state but they are seldom so full of praise for the pakistani premier, especially during calls with western leaders. sharif invited trump to visit pakistan, according to the statement, and the incoming u.s. leader agreed. “mr trump said that he would love to come to a fantastic country, fantastic place of fantastic people. please convey to the  pakistani people that they are amazing and all pakistanis i have known are exceptional people,” said the statement. few details are known about trump’s planned policy for south asia but the warm words between the leaders suggests ties could be reset under trump’s presidency and will ease concerns in islamabad that trump’s anti muslim rhetoric in the run up to the poll will not lead to unfriendly policies towards pakistan. at one point trump proposed banning muslims from the entering the united states, remarks that alarmed the predominantly muslim nation of 190 million people. islamabad has also been concerned about warmer ties between the united states and india, fearful that washington is pivoting towards new delhi at a time of heightened tensions between the nuclear armed neighbors who have fought three wars since their independence from british rule in 1947. trump also has business ties in india, which has stoked concerns in pakistan that under his presidency the united states may accelerate its shift towards new delhi. pakistan continues to receive aid as well as military funding and training from the united states, but the u.s. congress has recently held back some help due to frustrations about pakistan’s unwillingness to act against elements of the afghan taliban. relations hit new lows in may when a u.s. drone killed mullah akhtar mansour, the leader of the afghan taliban movement, on pakistani territory.

" u.s. lawmakers proposed targeted sanctions and travel restrictions on myanmar military officials on thursday over the treatment of the country’s rohingya muslim minority, one of the strongest efforts yet for washington to intervene in the humanitarian crisis. introduced the day before republican donald trump leaves on his first trip to asia as president, the legislation would reimpose some sanctions lifted last year as myanmar returned to democracy. it also would bar the united states from supplying most assistance to the country’s military until perpetrators of atrocities against the rohingya are held accountable. the measure does not target burmese leader aung san suu kyi, head of myanmar’s civilian led government and a nobel peace laureate who still enjoys strong support among some u.s. officials. but congressional aides said it is intended to underscore a strong desire among many members of congress for her to do more to help the rohingya. the legislation is sponsored by lawmakers including the republican senate armed services committee chairman john mccain, and senator ben cardin, the top democrat on the senate foreign relations committee. “this bill will allow congress to strengthen the president’s hand by making it clear to burmese officials that there will be consequences for their crimes against humanity,” cardin said in a statement. among other things, it re imposes a ban on jade and rubies from myanmar and requires a report on which individuals should be subjected to sanctions, and instructs the u.s. treasury department not to support international financial assistance programs that partner with enterprises owned by the myanmar military. a companion bill is also being introduced in the house of representatives. that measure is also bipartisan, led by representative eliot engel, the top democrat on the house foreign affairs committee, and republican representative steve chabot, another foreign affairs panel member. members of congress have been clamoring for a strong response to the plight of the rohingya, and the trump administration has been weighing labeling their treatment “ethnic cleansing.”  the state department announced on thursday that secretary of state rex tillerson would accompany trump on his trip to asia, and also stop in myanmar. more than 600,000 rohingya muslims have fled rakhine state in buddhist majority myanmar since security forces responded to rohingya militants’ attacks in august with a crackdown that has included reports of burnt villages and widespread killings. the united nations has denounced it as a classic example of ethnic cleansing.

" magellan midstream partners lp said on tuesday it was investigating the cause of a nearly 11,000 barrel gasoline spill from two above ground fuel storage tanks at its houston area terminal in texas during hurricane harvey. the leak at the galena park terminal is the biggest spill reported so far relating to the storm, which unleashed record flooding in the state in late august, destroying homes and killing scores of people.  the environmental protection agency has said federal and state authorities responded to spills linked to harvey at about a dozen industrial facilities.  the exact cause of the tank failures is now under investigation,  magellan spokesman bruce heine said. he said the company believed it was related to the flooding. magellan has cleaned up much of the spill, and recovered an undisclosed amount that escaped off the terminal s property into a nearby ditch and the houston ship channel, heine said.   clean up activities at the facility are continuing and we are currently removing and replacing affected soil,  he said.  the spill occurred on aug. 31, heine said.  magellan had initially reported a smaller volume of gasoline spilled to state authorities, but adjusted its estimate upward after it was able to make a full assessment, he said.  it s magellan s long term practice to conservatively report a product release to appropriate agencies and local authorities as soon as we become aware of a potential incident,  he said, explaining the smaller initial estimate.  in other words, we do not wait until absolute confirmation, as we want to give the earliest possible notice.  magellan has said that much of the rest of its infrastructure has returned to normal after the storm.

" u.n. special envoy for syria staffan de mistura urged russia on wednesday to convince its ally the syrian government of the need to clinch a peace deal to end the nearly seven year old war. de mistura, speaking on swiss television station rts, said  failure to make peace quickly through united nations mediation could lead to  a fragmentation of syria . russian president vladimir putin during a surprise visit on monday to russia s hmeymim air base in syria, declared that the work of russian forces was largely done in backing the assad government against militants, following the defeat of  the most battle hardened group of international terrorists.  de mistura, asked what signal putin could give from his position of force, said:  convince the (syrian) government that there is no time to lose.... you can think you win territory militarily but you have to win the peace.  and to win the peace, you have to have the courage to push the government to accept that there has to be a new constitution and new elections, through the united nations,  he said. the nearly seven year civil war in syria has killed hundreds of thousands of people and driven more than 11 million from their homes. all previous diplomatic efforts to resolve the conflict have ended in failure over the opposition s demand that president bashar al assad leave power and his refusal to go. the kremlin first launched air strikes in syria in september 2015 in its biggest middle east intervention in decades, turning the tide of the conflict in assad s favor.  now that it regards that mission complete, putin wants to help broker a peace deal and is keen to organize a special event in russia   a syrian congress on national dialogue   that moscow hopes will bring together the syrian government and opposition and try to hammer out a new constitution. but de mistura made clear that peace negotiations must be through the united nations in geneva, as mandated by the u.n. security council, adding:  otherwise it is not worth it.... this is a complicated war, it is only in geneva through the u.n.  the u.n. envoy has conducted shuttle diplomacy between the syrian government delegation led by chief negotiator bashar al ja afari and a unified opposition delegation.  the opposition told me clearly when they arrived here, and again yesterday and this morning too, that they are ready to meet the government right away to have a hard, difficult discussion.  the government is not ready, it has said it is not ready to meet the opposition. that is regrettable but diplomacy has many means,  de mistura said. a senior western diplomat said that the government delegation had failed to engage with de mistura on a new constitution and elections during a round of negotiations due to end on thursday.  clearly they did not have any intention to engage in this political process. and clearly they are not under sufficient pressure to do so,  the diplomat told reuters.  the clear impression is the regime wants to avoid the u.n. led political process at any cost.

" the u.s. government’s review of a landmark 2010 financial reform law will not be complete by early june as originally targeted, and officials will now report findings piece by piece, with priority given to banking regulations, sources familiar with the matter said on monday. president donald trump has pledged to do a “big number” on the dodd frank financial overhaul law, which raised banks’ capital requirements, restricted their ability to make speculative bets with customers’ money and created consumer protections in the wake of the financial crisis. in february, trump ordered treasury secretary steven mnuchin to review the law and report back within 120 days, saying his administration expected to be cutting large parts of it.  but the treasury department is still filling vacancies after the transition from the obama administration and there are not  enough officials to get the full review done by early june, three sources said. a treasury spokesperson dismissed the idea the report that would be broken up because the department is short handed, saying the reach of the project could require several separate reports, as permitted under the executive order. “treasury has an entire team dedicated to reviewing the financial regulatory rules and will begin reporting our findings to the president in june,” the department spokesperson said. “given the volume and scope of the issues we are reviewing that involve potential changes to the financial regulatory system, we are carefully considering the best options to begin rolling them out in the most effective and responsible manner,” the spokesperson said. the treasury department will first report back on what banking rules could be changed, including capital requirements, restrictions on leverage and speculative trading. examinations of capital markets, clearing houses and derivatives as well as the insurance and asset management industries and financial innovation and banking technology will come later, the sources said. it could be several months until these other stages of the financial reform review are completed, some of the sources said.  the piecemeal approach could create challenges for some sectors if parts of the report are significantly delayed. the report has been highly anticipated, as it marks the new administration’s most detailed foray into outlining what it wants to do with financial rules. trump previously has spoken only in broad terms about easing regulation surrounding lending.    any efforts to rework existing regulations or craft new legislation will be a lengthy and contentious process, something that banking lobbyists have said will make any delay to the administration’s initial findings costly for businesses eager for regulatory relief. former blackrock inc executive craig phillips is leading the administration’s plan for financial deregulation. alongside other treasury officials, he is soliciting feedback from banking industry groups and executives for how banking policy should be shaped. the change in the timing of the treasury report comes after trump ordered a separate review of some key planks of the dodd frank financial reform law. in april, trump signed a pair of executive orders directing a review of two additional regulatory powers   orderly liquidation authority, which allows regulators to step in and wind down a failing financial institution, and systemic designation, in which certain large firms may be deemed critical to the overall health of the financial system, meriting stricter oversight.  the findings from those reviews are not expected until october.

" zimbabwe electoral commission (zec) chairwoman rita makarau resigned on friday, months before a vote whose credibility is crucial to the new army backed government s efforts to re engage international lenders and lure investors, a senior government source said. makarau, seen as an ally of 93 year old former president robert mugabe, gave no reason for her resignation, the official, who declined to be named, said. president emmerson mnangagwa, who was sworn in two weeks ago in the wake of the de facto military coup that ended mugabe s 37 year rule, pledged to hold elections as scheduled next year. finance minister patrick chinamasa mentioned the credibility of the elections at least five times in a budget speech on thursday, a sign of the vote s importance in shoring up harare s democratic legitimacy. opposition parties have demanded reforms to an electoral system they say is skewed in the ruling zanu pf party s favor. makarau, who has been accused of being partisan, was overseeing an overhaul of the voters  roll, which the opposition movement for democratic change has described as  shambolic . makarau did not answer her mobile phone. a spokesman for the zec was unable to confirm makarau s departure.

" saudi arabia accused lebanon on monday of declaring war against it because of aggression by the iran backed lebanese shi ite group hezbollah, a dramatic escalation of a crisis threatening to destabilize the tiny arab country. lebanon has been thrust to the center of regional rivalry between saudi arabia and iran since the saudi allied lebanese politician saad al hariri quit as prime minister on saturday, blaming iran and hezbollah in his resignation speech.    saudi gulf affairs minister thamer al sabhan said the lebanese government would  be dealt with as a government declaring war on saudi arabia  because of what he described as aggression by hezbollah. faulting the hariri led administration for failing to take action against hezbollah during a year in office, sabhan said  there are those who will stop (hezbollah) and make it return to the caves of south lebanon , the heartland of the shi ite community. in an interview with al arabiya tv, he added:  lebanese must all know these risks and work to fix matters before they reach the point of no return.  he did not spell out what action saudi arabia might take against lebanon, a country with a weak and heavily indebted state that is still rebuilding from its 1975 90 civil war and where one in four people is a syrian refugee. there was no immediate comment from the lebanese government.  hezbollah is both a military and a political organization that is represented in the lebanese parliament and in the hariri led coalition government formed last year. its powerful guerrilla army is widely seen as stronger than the lebanese army, and has played a major role in the war in neighboring syria, another theater of saudi iranian rivalry where hezbollah has fought in support of the government. lebanese authorities said on monday the country s financial institutions could cope with hariri s resignation and the stability of the lebanese pound was not at risk. but the cash price of lebanon s u.s. dollar denominated bonds fell, with longer dated maturities suffering hefty losses as investors took a dim view of the medium  to longer term outlook for lebanon. hariri cited a plot to assassinate him during his unexpected resignation speech broadcast from saudi arabia which caught even his aides off guard. he also slammed hezbollah and iran, accusing them of sowing strife in the arab world. hezbollah leader sayyed hassan nasrallah has said he will not comment on hariri s speech, calling it a  saudi statement  and saying riyadh had forced hariri to resign. the sudden nature of hariri s resignation generated speculation in lebanon that his family s saudi construction business had been caught up in an anti corruption purge and he had been coerced into resigning.  saudi foreign minister adel jubeir said it was  nonsense  to suggest hariri had been coerced into quitting in a cnn interview on monday. hariri had quit because hezbollah had been  calling the shots  in the government, he said. hariri, a saudi citizen, was free to leave the country at any time, he said. interior minister nohad machnouk, a senior member of hariri s political party, said he was under the impression hariri would return to beirut within days.  a meeting between saudi king salman and hariri in riyadh on monday proved  rumors  wrong, he said   an apparent reference to speculation that hariri was detained or forced to quit.    earlier on monday, president michel aoun, a political ally of hezbollah, appealed for national unity. parliament speaker nabih berri, another political ally of hezbollah, said in a televised statement after meeting aoun it was too early to talk about forming a new government. the crisis could re aggravate tensions between sunni and shi ite muslims and afflict lebanese government with paralysis once again. all of the sides have called for calm and there has been no sign of unrest since hariri s resignation. the hariri led government took office last year in a political deal that made aoun president. the deal ended years of deadlock, and last month it produced lebanon s first budget since 2005. hariri flew to saudi arabia on friday after meeting in beirut the top adviser to iran s supreme leader, who described the coalition as  a victory  and  great success  afterwards.

" south korean public support for nuclear power on friday sucker punched a government policy to steer the country away from nuclear generated electricity as seoul said it would bow to a demand to resume construction of two new reactors.  president moon jae in came to power in may, after running  on a ticket that called for reducing south korea s nuclear and coal fired power generation in a push to use more natural gas and renewables.  those plans were dealt an unlooked for blow on friday when a public opinion survey found a majority of almost 60 percent in favour of resuming the stalled construction of two reactors.  building the two reactors could mean reversal of a strategy to slowly reduce nuclear energy s share of the power mix, and also significantly eat into the liquefied natural gas (lng) demand of the world s second largest consumer of the fuel.   our recommendation to the government is restarting construction,  said kim ji hyung, chairman of a government organised committee to study the nuclear projects.   our final public opinion survey showed 59.5 percent of (responding) south koreans chose to resume the construction,  kim told a news conference.  stability of power supply was cited as a primary reason for the choice in survey responses, the committee said.  we respect the will of the committee,  said south korea s presidential office spokesman park soo hyun.  an expert at a government think tank said the size of the win in favour of the projects meant the government had no choice but to go with the committee s recommendation.   the outcome was very unexpected ... many expected the difference would be a maximum 10 percentage points, but as it turned out, it stood nearly at 20,  said roh dong seok, senior research fellow at the korea energy economics institute.  the two 1,400 megawatt (mw) reactors   shin kori no.5 and shin kori no.6   were originally to be completed by march 2021 and march 2022, respectively, in the southeastern city of ulsan. the government announced a suspension of the projects after coming to power, saying it would consult the public over their future.  the committee conducted four rounds of surveys, including phone interviews of 20,006 people and public discussions involving some 470 citizens, over the past three months. with the reactors now likely going ahead, completion dates are set for october 2021 and october 2022, according to state run nuclear operator korea hydro & nuclear power [krhydr.ul]. (for a graphic on 'south korea 2016 power generation mix' click reut.rs/2xtozkb)      shares of korea electric power corp rose 0.6 percent to 41,110 won ($36.32) on friday, after jumping nearly 6 percent following the announcement of the survey results.      kepco engineering & construction, in charge of the reactors  design, lost 1.2 percent after surging as much as 20 percent. kepco plant service & engineering gained 1.7 percent.  building nuclear power plants takes years, so the decision in favour of the two new reactors will not change south korea s immediate fuel demand patterns.  but the vote, which surprised many in the industry, does impact the long term outlook for the country s fuel consumption, with the biggest impact likely falling on imports of lng.   full implementation of moon s election promises could have resulted in around 10 million tonnes (a year) of extra lng demand by 2030. this now seems unlikely,  said kiah wei giam, principal analyst at energy consultancy wood mackenzie.  that compares to south korea s lng imports of 33.4 million tonnes last year, according to customs data. [lng/krtrd] giam said, however, the survey did not totally derail the government s energy policies.   with the planned nuclear phase out delayed, it will be interesting to see whether more aggressive anti coal policies are enacted,  giam said.  park won joo, deputy minister for energy & resources, said later at a briefing the government will reach a final decision on the nuclear reactors next tuesday and then tell the state run nuclear operator when to resume project construction.

" lebanese prime minister saad al hariri rescinded his resignation on tuesday, drawing a line under a month long crisis triggered when he announced from riyadh that he was stepping down and remained outside lebanon for weeks. his coalition government, which includes the iran backed hezbollah group, reaffirmed a state policy of staying out of conflicts in arab states. hariri s saudi allies accuse hezbollah of waging war across the middle east as agents of iran. hariri s shock resignation had thrust lebanon to the forefront of the regional quarrel between saudi arabia and iran, which has been played out on battlefields in syria, iraq and yemen. lebanese officials said saudi arabia had coerced hariri, a long time saudi ally, into resigning and put him under effective house arrest until an intervention by france led to his return to lebanon. saudi arabia and hariri have denied this. president michel aoun, a hezbollah ally, refused to accept his resignation while he remained abroad. saudi concern over the influence wielded by shi ite muslim iran and hezbollah in other arab states had been widely seen as the root cause of the crisis, which raised fears for lebanon s economic and political stability.  the lebanese policy of  dissociation  was declared in 2012 to keep the deeply divided state out of regional conflicts such as the civil war in neighbouring syria. despite the policy, hezbollah is heavily involved there, sending thousands of fighters to help president bashar al assad. in its first meeting since hariri s resignation, the cabinet on tuesday reaffirmed its commitment to the policy.   all (the government s) political components decide to dissociate themselves from all conflicts, disputes, wars or the internal affairs of brother arab countries, in order to preserve lebanon s economic and political relations,  hariri said. lebanon, where sunni muslim, shi ite, christian and druze groups fought a civil war from 1975 1990, has a governing system designed to share power among sectarian groups. hariri, a wealthy sunni businessman with long ties to the kingdom, had denounced iran during his resignation speech and said he was outside lebanon because he feared for his family s safety. his father, an ex prime minister, was assassinated in 2005. in a speech during the cabinet session, hariri warned that the tensions in the region could easily drag lebanon down a dangerous route, and the issues which had led to the crisis could not be ignored.  developments in the region suggest a new wave of conflict ... perhaps the conflict is nearing the end, and lebanon cannot be plunged into chaos on the finish line.  if we are rejecting interference by any state in lebanese affairs, it cannot be that we accept that any lebanese side interferes in the affairs of arab states,  hariri said, an apparent reference to hezbollah.  we have to address this issue, and take a decision announcing our disassociation, in words and deeds,  he said.     hariri s resignation was accompanied by a sharp escalation in saudi statements targeting the lebanese state, with riyadh at one point accusing the beirut government of declaring war against it. western governments, including the united states, stressed their support for hariri and lebanon.  hariri will be in paris on friday for a meeting of the international lebanon support group, a body that includes the five members of the u.n. security council   britain, china, france, russia and the united states. the meeting, to be opened by french president emmanuel macron, aims in part to put pressure on saudi arabia and iran to desist from interference in lebanon, diplomats said.

" u.s. lawmakers said on monday they did not know when legislation to impose new sanctions on russia might come up for a vote in the house of representatives, and the white house said it had concerns about the measure. the legislation passed the senate by a nearly unanimous margin two weeks ago, looking like it might complicate president donald trump’s desire for warmer relations with moscow, where officials have denounced new sanctions. a white house official said the trump administration felt some provisions in the bill would interfere with its ability to use sanctions to try to influence russia. “there are some provisions in the senate bill that would unprecedentedly impair treasury’s ability to wield its sanctions tools, risk endangering the transatlantic sanctions coalition, and weaken the state department’s ability to credibly signal that we would calibrate our sanctions in response to russian behavior,” the official said in an emailed statement, requesting anonymity. republican senator bob corker, chairman of the senate foreign relations committee and a co author of the legislation, said he hoped for progress within the next day or two on a procedural issue that has kept the house from taking up the countering iran’s destabilizing activities act, which also includes the new sanctions against russia. the measure must pass the house, where trump’s fellow republicans control a larger majority than in the senate, before it can be sent for trump to sign into law or veto. house republican leaders said last week that the senate bill violated a constitutional requirement that any bill affecting government revenues must originate in the house, something known as a “blue slip” violation. house aides also said leadership had not yet decided whether to vote on the senate bill once the “blue slip” issue was resolved, or first refer it to house committees, which could further delay or change it. democrats said they were skeptical about the “blue slip” explanation, noting that the issue had resolved very quickly in recent years for other bills. corker said senate republicans remained solidly behind the legislation. “i’ve heard no one here have second thoughts, by the way” he told reuters. “if you find one, please tell me.” white house spokesman sean spicer declined comment during a news briefing on monday on whether the administration would support the sanctions bill.

" the u.s. department of agriculture said on tuesday that an internal email sent to staff at its agricultural research service unit this week calling for a suspension of “public facing documents,” including news releases and photos, was flawed and that new guidance has been sent out to replace it. the ars focuses on scientific research into the main issues facing agriculture, including long term climate change. president donald trump has cast doubt on whether man made climate change is real and has railed against ex president barack obama’s efforts to combat it. “this internal email was released without departmental direction, and prior to departmental guidance being issued,” usda said in a statement. “ars will be providing updated direction to its staff.” it said peer reviewed scientific papers from the unit should not be blocked. “ars values and is committed to maintaining the free flow of information between our scientists and the american public.” the original email, sent jan. 23, said: “starting immediately and until further notice, ars will not release any public facing documents. this includes, but is not limited to, news releases, photos, fact sheets, news feeds, and social media content.” usda officials said that after the email was sent, acting usda deputy secretary michael l. young sent out a three page memo to usda agency department heads and other key agency officials outlining the interim procedures staff should follow. a copy of the interim procedures memo, dated jan. 23 and seen by reuters, shows many of the steps reflect either the same or similar measures taken by the previous administration. reuters also saw a memo, dated jan. 22, 2009, that was sent to agency officials by former agriculture secretary tom vilsack. the 2017 memo, however, differs in two main areas.  it centralizes the agency’s media inquiries and social media presence through the office of the secretary. as part of that, the memo asks usda agencies to “review their websites, blog posts and other social media and, consistent with direction you will receive from the office of communication, remove references to policy priorities and initiatives of the previous administration.” it also rescinds the ability of usda agencies to close an office or notify local delegations of office closures.

(tmsnrt.rs/2p8m8eu) some 22 of his appearances were in settings other than the white house, air force one, a government agency or at mar a lago, a florida resort that his administration has called the “winter white house.” that compares to 62 such appearances by obama in his first 100 days, 80 for bush and 46 for clinton. reuters reviewed public remarks delivered by the presidents using white house websites, pool reports and documents archived by the american presidency project at the university of california, santa barbara.  trump made public comments on five separate occasions at mar a lago. none of the other three presidents spoke to the public from a personal residence during their first 100 days, although bush spoke twice at camp david, the rustic presidential retreat in maryland.     asked about his travel, trump’s advisers say he is focused on implementing the promises he made at his campaign rallies.     “there is obviously a premium on his time,” said white house spokeswoman natalie strom. “we proceed with any additional travel very thoughtfully.”     bradley blakeman, who was deputy assistant for scheduling and appointments under bush, said trump may be missing out on opportunities to sell his message to the public.  “deals are made in washington on pennsylvania avenue, but they are sold on main street, usa,” blakeman said. “it’s an important part of the bully pulpit.”     he said trump should do targeted events focused on specific legislative priorities that will get coverage by local news outlets, where stories on presidential visits tend to be more positive than in the national media.     during his first 100 days, bush visited more than half a dozen schools in washington and at least five different states as he promoted his education initiative, no child left behind.      trump’s first major legislative push has focused on reforming the u.s. healthcare system, but he has not yet delivered remarks at a medical facility. in an interview with reuters last week, trump lamented the confining nature of the presidency with its 24 hour secret service protection. “you’re really into your own little cocoon, because you have such massive protection that you really can’t go anywhere,” he said. still, he remains a constant focus of public attention, helped by his use of twitter, a tool that was seldom used or was entirely unavailable to his most recent three predecessors. “interaction online does not completely replace the value of in person appearances, but you can’t ignore the fact that there is no limit on the amount of people the president’s tweets can reach,” strom said. larry jacobs, director of the center for the study of politics and governance at the university of minnesota, said that while trump’s use of social media had opened a new chapter in presidential communication, his lack of sustained attention on any one issue undercut his message.     “there’s not a focus there. when a president is all over the map, then he loses his power,” jacobs said.

" as americans vote for a new president on tuesday, hundreds of thousands of voters in california’s bay area and boulder, colorado, will also decide whether they want levies on sugary drinks, another step toward making soda taxes a norm. three cities in california   san francisco, berkeley and albany   and boulder, colorado, have become the latest battleground in a so called “war on sugar” that centers on sweetened drinks. over 800,000 voters will decide on ballot measures to introduce taxes of 1 or 2 cents per ounce on soft drinks on nov. 9, just weeks after the world health organization (who) advocated that governments should impose these types of levies.  the push for taxes on sugar and sodas has gathered momentum this year, as officials and health advocates seek ways to stem health epidemics of diabetes and obesity. on most ballots, the tax would not apply to diet sodas but does affect some juices, sports drinks and other beverages with added sugar. reducing consumption of sugary drinks is seen as a relatively easy way for people to cut down on added sugars, recommended by groups including the who, the u.s. food and drug administration (fda) and the american heart association. the trend has prompted worry and millions of dollars in advertising and lobbying campaigns from beverage industry giants like pepsico inc and coca cola co that are facing declining sales of their flagship products in markets including the united states.  so far this year, britain and philadelphia decided to introduce levies on soft drinks and countries including south africa have proposed similar measures. this follows a decision by mexico to introduce such a tax in 2014. the broadening of these efforts raises the prospect of establishing them as the norm after numerous previous attempts failed, advocates say. “the more these taxes pass, the more they will be considered in other jurisdictions,” said jim o’hara, health promotion policy director with the center for science in the public interest in washington. both pepsi and coke have are increasing options for less sugary drinks, responding to changing consumer tastes. consumption of carbonated soft drinks hit a 30 year low in the united states last year, as water sales continued their climb, according to beverage digest. the majority of california voters support government measure to reduce consumption of sugary beverages, according to a field poll released in february. in san francisco, a 2014 bid for a similar tax failed to pass a two thirds vote, but is expected by many to succeed this time around, as only a simple majority is required. the votes in the other cities are expected by both advocates and opponents alike to be tighter. fighting for survival, big soda has been outspending advocates of the measure, but not by much. industry spending to oppose the taxes this year in the bay area alone has swelled to around $27 million to $28 million, versus around some $19 million by advocates, according to estimates from both sides. billionaires including michael bloomberg have joined the fray, contributing $15 million to pro tax campaigns in the bay area. the former mayor of new york waged an unsuccessful campaign in the city to cut soda sizes in 2014. opponents say the tax, which would be levied on distributors, is unfairly targeted at drinks makers and could raise food costs beyond just soda. “in effect, this is a grocery tax. it could be spread out on many items” by distributors, said joe arellano, spokesman for the “no grocery tax” campaigns in california’s bay area.  in the california cities, the measures would introduce a penny per ounce tax. in boulder, it would be 2 cents. “there’s no tax we will support to change behavior of consumers. we don’t think they work,” said susan neely, head of the american beverage association. she cited efforts by soda companies like reducing portion sizes. the group is suing to block philadelphia’s tax. she said it was unclear yet if the group would challenge the potential levies in california or colorado. it is unclear how long lasting the impacts of the taxes in places like mexico and berkeley will be, but some early research suggests partial pass through of the taxes from businesses to customers and an impact on per capita consumption.

" a democrat who sits on the u.s. federal election commission (fec) is planning to resign before her term expires amid frustrations about partisan gridlock, the new york times reported on sunday. fec commissioner ann ravel told the times in an interview she intended to submit her letter of resignation this week, a move that would open the door for president donald trump to make his own appointment to the panel. “the ability of the commission to perform its role has deteriorated significantly,” ravel told the newspaper.  “i think i can be more effective on the outside.” ravel said she was particularly frustrated about split votes among the fec’s three democrats and three republicans. the lack of consensus among the fec’s members has made it impossible to rein in campaign abuses, she said. ravel told the new york times she planned to return to california, where she previously worked as a state regulator identifying dark money that flowed into state elections.

"last year, we reported about women who attended an  anti-racism  music festival in sweden that were raped and molested by migrant men. this report is yet another shocking example of how the west is actually importing a real rape culture.according to police spokesman stefan dangardt, numerous  foreign men  sexually assaulted the women during borl nge s  peace and love  festival, although three suspects who were arrested were later released because they claimed they were minors.it appears that nothing has changed since last year. yesterday, swedish police received several reports of rape after   music festivals at various locations on friday evening.a 15-year-old girl was raped during a concert at the br valla festival in norrk ping on friday night.according to the police, the girl was held and raped by a man in the midst of the crowd in front of the concert goers, without anyone intervening.  it s terrible that one has to experience such a thing with a lot of people around, says police spokesman, thomas agnevik, to aftonbladet.we have little information about the perpetrator and about what has happened, he said, while encouraging those present during the concert to contact the police if they saw anything suspicious.the girl was taken care of and underwent a medical examination.during the city festival in v ster s, two rapes were reported, one of a 16 year old girl.  we have talked to her and obtained information, but we currently have no suspects, said spokesperson for the police in v stmanland, thomas gustafsson.a 26-year-old woman has also reported rape after the festival.  she has been sent to hospital and we have been unable to talk to her. therefore, i do not have any more details, says gustafsson.rapes at swedish festivals are not really news anymore. it is merely about announcements. we are actually there now.  speisa",1
" every american president has a favorite foreign leader. for donald trump, it seems to be japanese prime minister shinzo abe. the two leaders toasted their  bromance  on monday as they wrapped up two days of golf, burgers and serious talks on trade and north korea. the two men have met face to face six times since trump was elected u.s. president a year ago and had 16 telephone conversations. they ve played golf twice, once at trump s mar a lago resort in florida and again on sunday outside tokyo. abe recalled how his grandfather, then premier nobusuke kishi, and president dwight d. eisenhower began the tradition of u.s. japan golf diplomacy 60 years ago.  when you play golf not just once but two times, the person must be your favorite guy,  abe said ahead of a formal banquet with trump on monday. he added that never had two japanese and american leaders forged such a close bond in just one year. abe was the first foreign leader to meet trump after his election last november, a win that caught tokyo off guard after many had expected democratic party candidate hillary clinton to win and worried about trump s  america first  rhetoric.  trump told the dinner guests that for protocol reasons, he shouldn t have met a foreign leader before his inauguration   but when he tried to call abe to wave him off, the japanese premier was already on a plane to new york.  we have to spend more time together because i enjoyed every minute of it even though he (abe) is a very tough negotiator,  trump said.  we will be back soon.   trump and abe are hardly the only u.s. and japanese leaders to bond. ronald reagan and yasuhiro nakasone set the gold standard for friendly ties between leaders of the two allies back in the 1980s, when they famously called each other by the nicknames  ron  and  yasu . george w. bush and junichiro koizumi also bonded during koizumi s 2001 2006 term as japanese premier, playing ball, eating bbq at bush s texas ranch, and visiting elvis presley s graceland mansion, where koizumi crooned elvis tunes.  diplomatic experts said the personal chemistry between abe and trump appeared real, but also noted that forging warm ties were in a way a diplomatic necessity for japan, which ultimately relies on the u.s. nuclear umbrella for its security.

" the trial of a mexican man accused of murdering a woman while illegally in the united states began in san francisco on monday, a case that president donald trump has cited as an example of the dangers posed by lax border security. juan francisco lopez sanchez, also known as jose ines garcia zarate, has said he shot kate steinle by accident on a pier in the california city on july 1, 2015. he has pleaded not guilty to second degree murder, a charge that can bring between 15 years to life in prison. court officials confirmed the trial had started but did not offer further details of the proceedings.   he did not know the object in his hand was a gun,  matt gonzalez, an attorney for the defendant, was quoted as saying by nbc bay area before he headed into the courtroom.  he does not bear criminal responsibility.  assistant district attorney diana garcia declined to comment on the case. prosecutors have accused the defendant of recklessly pointing a stolen gun at people on the pier. prosecutors and defense attorneys were in court and not immediately available for comment. garcia zarate had been deported to mexico five times since first entering the united states as a juvenile, the san francisco chronicle and other local media reported.  steinle has been frequently invoked by name by trump as part of his signature pledges to halt illegal immigration and crack down on so called  sanctuary cities  that refuse to comply with certain federal immigration laws. in june, the u.s. house of representatives voted 228 195 to pass the  no sanctuary for criminals act,  which would withhold some federal grants to sanctuary cities. by a vote of 257 167, the chamber also passed  kate s law,  named for kate steinle, to increase penalties for illegal immigrants who return to the united states. under the laws, immigrants in the country illegally would face mandatory detention for past convictions of an expanded number of offenses. san francisco, like other sanctuary jurisdictions, has defended its approach as making the city safer, saying its practice of not inquiring about immigration status makes immigrants, including those in the country illegally, more willing to report crimes.

" a prosecutor who led an investigation into a graft scandal involving the campaign of mexican president enrique pena nieto said on wednesday he was fired without justification, as the senate prepares to vote on whether to reinstate him. mexico s acting attorney general fired santiago nieto, the attorney general for election related crimes, last week on grounds that he broke a code of conduct.  his summary dismissal came just days after an explosive interview with newspaper reforma in which nieto accused emilio lozoya, the former boss of state oil firm pemex and a senior member of pena nieto s 2012 campaign team, of writing to him to ask that he be declared innocent of funneling odebrecht cash into the president s campaign. brazilian construction firm odebrecht is at the heart of a brazilian bribery and kickback probe, known as lava jato or car wash, that has reverberated across latin america. javier coello trejo, lozoya s lawyer, said on wednesday he had filed two criminal complaints against nieto, alleging the former prosecutor had violated laws governing criminal proceedings, broadcaster televisa reported.  nieto s firing angered opposition politicians and has even threatened to delay discussions among lawmakers about next year s budget.  in wednesday s television interview, nieto denied breaking any rules, or revealing any sensitive information.  i didn t violate any code of ethics,  said nieto, who was leading the probe targeting both lozoya and the president s campaign. the senate is due to vote in coming days on whether to reinstate nieto, but it is still not clear when the vote will be and if it will be public.  in a sign of how tempers have frayed over the issue, opposition lawmakers have promised to delay voting on the 2018 budget until nieto s case is resolved. the dispute is complicating efforts to shake off graft allegations that could hurt the ruling institutional revolutionary party (pri) ahead of next year s presidential election. nieto could not be reached immediately for comment on wednesday. both the president and lozoya, his close ally, have previously denied involvement in any wrongdoing related to the 2012 campaign. mindful that corruption has become a key issue in the 2018 election, the pri has overseen the arrest of various former state governors. lozoya poses a more difficult challenge, given his proximity to the president. opposition lawmakers have also criticized a decision by the senate s governance body to hold the nieto vote in private, vowing to appeal against the ruling.

" u.s. senate republicans rammed forward president donald trump’s tax cut bill on tuesday in an abrupt, partisan committee vote that set up a full vote by the senate as soon as thursday, although some details of the measure remained unsettled. as disabled protesters shouted: “kill the bill, don’t kill us,” in a capitol hill hearing room, the senate budget committee, with no discussion, quickly approved the legislation on a 12 11 party line vote that left democrats fuming. republican committee members quickly left the room after the vote as democrats complained about a lack of discussion on a bill that would overhaul the u.s. tax code and add an estimated $1.4 trillion to the $20 trillion national debt over 10 years. after the vote, trump told reporters: “i think we’re going to get it passed,” adding that it would have some adjustments.   republicans are hurrying to move their complex tax legislation forward, hoping to avoid the protracted infighting that doomed their effort to repeal obamacare four months ago. since trump took office in january, he and fellow republicans in command of both chambers of congress have approved no major legislation, a fact they want to change before facing voters in the 2018 congressional elections. if the senate approves its tax measure later this week, it would need to be reconciled with a version already approved by the house of representatives before anything could be sent to the white house for trump to sign into law. republican leaders conceded that they had yet to round up the votes needed for passage in the senate, where they hold a narrow 52 48 majority. “it’s a challenging exercise,” senate republican leader mitch mcconnell said at a news conference. democrats have called the republican tax plan a giveaway to corporations and the rich. the senate bill would slash the corporate tax rate to 20 percent from 35 percent after a one year delay. it would impose a onetime, cut rate tax on corporations’ foreign profits, while exempting future foreign profits from u.s. taxation. tax rates for many individuals and families would also be cut temporarily before rising back to their previous levels in 2025. key tax breaks would also be curbed or eliminated, making the bill a mixed bag for some middle class families. some taxes paid by wealthy americans would be repealed. wall street moved higher on the news that the bill would move to a full senate vote, with the benchmark s&p 500 .spx index closing up a little over 1 percent. as written, the bill would widen the u.s. budget deficit by an estimated $1.4 trillion over 10 years. republicans maintain that gap would be narrowed by additional economic growth. senator bob corker, one of few remaining republican fiscal hawks in congress, said he worked out a deal satisfying his concerns that the tax cuts add too much to the national debt. he said the bill would be modified to automatically raise tax revenues if growth targets were not reached. “we got a commitment that puts us in a pretty good place,” he said. although details were not immediately available, corker said he expected more information to come out on thursday as part of the bill. the concession immediately drew a detractor as republican senator john kennedy told reporters he “would rather drink weed killer than vote for the thing,” adding: “i don’t like voting for automatic tax increases.”  the corker concession was one of several lingering uncertainties in the bill that senate aides said would be nailed down as the measure neared a floor vote. republican senator susan collins, who remains undecided on how she will vote on the bill, said “productive discussions” continued and that she would offer an amendment preserving the $10,000 deduction for property tax payments. the deduction is in the house bill, but not the senate version.     republican senator ron johnson voted for the bill in the budget committee, even though he had said it did not cut taxes deeply enough for some non corporate businesses. the final version could address his concerns. aides said tax writers were working to change the tax rate for non corporate businesses, preserve an individual deduction for property tax payments, and incorporate corker’s tax revenue idea. democratic senator jeff merkley told msnbc that the corker concession was “an absolute gimmick” that could be undermined later. “it’s just a justification to let those who have argued that they don’t believe in increasing the deficit actually vote for a bill which does exactly that,” merkley said. as the tax fight played out, a new battle opened on another front as democratic congressional leaders chuck schumer and nancy pelosi skipped a white house meeting with trump to discuss spending, immigration and other issues after trump criticized them on twitter. lawmakers must renew government funding before it expires on dec. 8 or risk a shutdown. democrats hope to use their leverage on the budget issue to renew protections for young immigrants who entered the country illegally as children.

" the republican speaker of the texas house of representatives said on friday a bill to limit bathroom access for transgender people would face a tough time in the chamber, where there are worries of an economic hit to the state if it became law. speaker joe straus, who sets the republican dominated house’s legislative agenda, stopped short of saying the measure was doomed. he made his remarks at a university of texas forum in austin.  “i don’t feel a great deal of fervor to promote that bill in the house,” straus said.  analysts expect straus to send senate bill 6 (sb 6) to a committee led by one of his political supporters, who will keep it tucked away. the measure would then die when the current session ends in late may. “straus is signaling very clearly that sb 6 is dead,” said mark jones, a professor of political science at rice university in houston.  straus reiterated his opposition to the legislation, which was approved by the republican controlled state senate this month on a mostly party line vote. the bill would require people to use restrooms in public schools and government run buildings that correspond with the gender on their birth certificate rather than the gender with which they identify. the speaker called it “manufactured and unnecessary.” the bill is one of several similar measures before various state legislatures this year on the issue.  a similar law enacted a year ago in north carolina prompted  the relocation of sporting events and economic boycotts that were estimated to have cost the state hundreds of millions of dollars. the texas association of business, the state’s largest employers’ group, has said such a law there would cost the state billions of dollars in lost revenue a year. the bill’s main backer, republican lieutenant governor dan patrick, has said it would keep sexual predators out of bathrooms and changing rooms, and he has labeled as fiction reports that there would be economic effects on the state. straus’ san antonio district is planning to host the ncaa men’s final four basketball championship next year. economists forecast the region could lose more than $200 million in revenue if the legislation was passed and in response the ncaa were to relocate the championship.

" the top technology official at the u.s. office of personnel management announced her retirement on monday amid calls for her ouster by some republican lawmakers. donna seymour, chief information officer, said in an email to her colleagues that was seen by reuters that leaving was a “very tough decision.” she added that she felt it was in the “agency’s best interest that my presence does not distract from the great work this team does every single day.” house oversight chairman jason chaffetz had repeatedly called for seymour’s resignation, lodging complaints that her mistakes helped lead to the opm data breach disclosed last year that exposed the personal information of 22 million individuals. in response to the sudden announcement, chaffetz’s panel canceled a hearing scheduled for wednesday to examine the breach. in a statement, chaffetz called the retirement “good news” but said he was disappointed she would no longer testify. “on her watch, whether through negligence or incompetence, millions of americans lost their privacy and personal data,” chaffetz said. representative elijah cummings, the top democrat on the oversight panel, countered that republican efforts to blame seymour for the hack were “unfair and inaccurate” and would discourage qualified technical professionals from pursuing public service. seymour is the second high ranking official to leave opm since the breach was disclosed. katherine archuleta, the agency’s director, resigned in july. earlier this month, chaffetz subpoenaed opm for documents related to the hack, which intelligence officials have privately blamed on china.  the utah republican has accused the agency of not acting in good faith with the committee because it has only provided partially redacted versions of the files, which were described by seymour as “outdated security documents” in testimony she gave in june 2015. chaffetz has expressed concern that the manuals could be used to launch another cyber attack. beth cobert, the acting head of opm, praised seymour’s 37 year career in federal government in a statement and lauded her for helping to modernize the agency’s information technology over the past year.

" sudan expects the united states to lift economic sanctions as khartoum has met all the required conditions, a sudanese minister said on wednesday, days before washington is due to announce a decision. the u.s. government has said it is deciding whether to lift a raft of penalties imposed first over khartoum s perceived support of global terrorism, later its violent suppression of rebels in darfur. former u.s. president barack obama temporarily eased some of the sanctions that have effectively cut khartoum off from large parts of the global financial system. officials said the gesture was meant to recognize khartoum s moves to end conflicts and its help in the war on terrorism. in july, u.s. president donald trump s administration postponed for three months a decision on whether to remove the restrictions full time   giving it an oct. 12 deadline to make up its mind.  sudan has fulfilled all the necessary conditions relating to the roadmap and the u.s. administration is a witness to that and therefore we expect the sanctions to be lifted,  sudan s state minister for foreign affairs, hamed momtaz, told reuters. washington has said sudan needs to resolve its internal conflicts and let more aid into darfur and other rebellious border areas, among other conditions. some rights groups have raised concerns, saying the lifting of sanctions could lead to further abuses.  we re afraid lifting the sanctions could pave way for the government to ... violate rights,  said  al buraq al nazir al warraq, the executive manager of the sudanese observatory for human rights, a group suspended by the government. any lifting of economic penalties would be a major turnaround for the government of president omar hassan al bashir, who once played host to osama bin laden and is wanted by the international criminal court on charges of orchestrating genocide in darfur.

" a saudi official has visited northern syria with a u.s. envoy to discuss reconstruction of raqqa, which kurdish and arab militias backed by a u.s. led coalition, captured from islamic state on tuesday, an adviser to the militias said.  saudi gulf affairs minister thamer al sabhan visited the area with brett mcgurk, the u.s. special envoy to the coalition against islamic state, and met the raqqa civil council said amed sido, an adviser to the syrian democratic forces (sdf) alliance.  the saudi okaz newspaper also reported on thursday that sabhan had visited northern syria and that riyadh and washington had discussed the reconstruction of raqqa.  saudi arabia is a member of the u.s. led international coalition against islamic state, set up in 2014, but no senior officials from riyadh are known to have visited areas held by coalition allies in syria. saudi arabia s foreign ministry was not immediately available for comment.  the sdf s four month battle against islamic state in raqqa, aided by coalition air strikes, left much of the city in ruins and forced much of its population to flee to camps nearby. international charity mercy corps said on thursday that most of the city was uninhabitable.  the sdf and its allies set up the raqqa civil council to run the city after the fighting was over.  the international coalition s 73 members also include european countries, other arab countries and turkey. its work includes supporting stabilization and restoration of public services to areas taken from islamic state militants. the saudi officials who visited raqqa to check the area were there to listen to discussions rather than take part, sido said, adding that they met a reconstruction committee set up by the council.  they promised that they would contribute in construction in raqqa in the future,  sido said. sido is also an sdf coordinator with the coalition.  the main priority for the city s reconstruction now is clearing landmines and bodies, and working on water and electricity projects, sido said. while no concrete plans were set in motion, sido continued,  we consider it a first visit, a first step, that could be the beginning of future relations .

" australia s world famous uluru, formerly known as ayers rock, will be closed to climbers from 2019, its management board said on wednesday, ending a decades long campaign by aborigines to protect their sacred monolith in the northern territory. a board of eight traditional owners and four government officials voted unanimously to close the rock to climbers, a spokesperson told reuters.  the climb is a men s sacred area, the men have closed it,  chairman sammy wilson added in a statement.  it has cultural significance that includes certain restrictions.   the unesco world heritage listed 348 metre (1,142 ft) rock, known for its shifting red ochre colors, is a top tourist drawcard, attracting around 300,000 visitors each year, despite its remote desert location near alice springs. the traditional owners of uluru, the anangu people, have called for the climb to be closed since 1985, when the park was placed in indigenous hands.  the rock s board said in a report in 2010 that they would close the attraction to climbers if the proportion of visitors who tried to climb it dropped below 20 percent. they took the matter to a vote on wednesday after data showed the number of climbers had fallen below that threshold, from about three quarters throughout the 1990s to just 16.2 per cent between 2011 and 2015. the ban will take effect on oct. 26, 2019, exactly 34 years after uluru was handed back to its traditional owners. australians are still the most common visitors to climb the rock, followed by the japanese, according to parks australia. the climb is closed about 77 percent of the time due to dangerous weather or cultural reasons.  there have been 36 confirmed fatalities at uluru since records were first kept in the 1950s, with the most recent in 2010.

" incoming u.s. senate democratic leader chuck schumer on friday said he is “very concerned” about republican u.s. president elect donald trump’s selection of senator jeff sessions as attorney general and indicated there would be tough questioning in the chamber’s confirmation process. “given some of his past statements and his staunch opposition to immigration reform, i am very concerned about what he would do with the civil rights division at the department of justice and want to hear what he has to say,” schumer said in a statement.

" germany would take advantage of any trade opportunities in asia and south america left by a protectionist united states, vice chancellor sigmar gabriel said, after u.s. president donald trump withdrew from the trans pacific partnership (tpp). “if trump starts a trade war with asia and south america, it will open opportunities for us,” gabriel told handelsblatt newspaper in an interview published on tuesday.  “trump must simply recognize that the u.s. economy often isn’t competitive, while the german (economy) is,” he said, criticizing trump’s threat to impose a 35 percent tariff on german cars imported from mexico. trump signed an executive order formally withdrawing from the 12 nation tpp on monday, following through on a promise made during his election campaign. he called the move a “great thing for the american worker”. gabriel   economy minister and leader of the center left social democrats (spd), who is expected to run against chancellor angela merkel in september’s election   said german industry should remain confident in the face of trump’s moves. barely 10 percent of german exports go to the united states, gabriel said, while 60 percent go to other countries in europe. “you can see the weight of our economic interests,” said gabriel. “germany should act with self confidence and not be fearful or servile.” “we are a highly successful, technologically advanced export nation with many hard working people and smart companies.” bernd lange, a social democrat and chairman of the trade committee in the european parliament, told broadcaster rbb that germany and the european union should look into expanding trade with china and other countries. “we must certainly speak with china because it is trying to jump into the gap left by the united states, even if they have other practices,” he said. lange said the european union should also push for closer ties with countries that had similar values, including canada, japan and australia. he said he expected the european parliament to approve a free trade agreement with canada by a large majority.

" top u.s. intelligence officials will testify before a senate panel next week on the law governing the collection of foreign intelligence, parts of which are due to expire at the end of the year, the senate intelligence committee said on friday.  director of national intelligence dan coats, acting fbi director andrew mccabe, national security agency director mike rogers and deputy u.s. attorney general rod rosenstein will appear before the committee in both open public and closed door hearings on wednesday to discuss the foreign intelligence surveillance act, or fisa, the committee said in a statement.  the next day, former fbi director james comey, who was fired by president donald trump last month, is scheduled to testify before the same committee.  comey had been overseeing an fbi investigation into russian interference during the 2016 presidential election and possible collusion between moscow and trump associates, and the senate panel is conducting a parallel probe. a part of fisa known as section 702 will expire on dec. 31 unless congress votes to reauthorize it. the statute allows the nsa to collect digital communications of foreigners believed to be living overseas whose communications pass through american phone or internet providers. for technical reasons, it also incidentally collects data on americans, a practice that privacy advocates have said evades constitutional protections against warrantless searches. fisa and u.s. surveillance practices have come under increased scrutiny in recent months amid unsubstantiated assertions by president donald trump and other republicans that the white house under former president barack obama improperly spied on trump or his associates.  a bipartisan coalition of lawmakers in the house of representatives is working on legislation that would renew section 702 but with additional transparency and oversight, among other changes, though it remains unclear if it would have enough support to pass congress and be signed by trump. a white house official told reuters in march the administration supported the law’s renewal and did not want to alter it.

" the war in the philippine city of marawi saw islamist insurgents execute civilians or use them as human shields, while military air strikes killed non combatants and may have been used in excess, an amnesty international report said on friday. the investigation by the rights group on the bloody five month battle was based on interviews with 48 witnesses from september until early november and called for an independent inquiry. the conflict in marawi, the only predominantly muslim city in the mainly catholic philippines, was the country s biggest and longest battle since world war two. more than 1,100 people, mostly insurgents, were killed, including 166 soldiers and 47 civilians, according to the authorities. at least 350,000 people were displaced and large parts of marawi have been decimated by air strikes.  witnesses described at least 10 separate incidents where at least 25 people were executed by the muslim extremists because they were christians. amnesty described those as war crimes.  it also said 10 hostages may have been killed in a single bombing run by the armed forces, and said an independent inquiry should include an assessment as to whether the air strikes were proportionate to the threat.   they must initiate a prompt, effective and impartial investigation into whether its bombings of civilian neighborhoods was proportional under international humanitarian law,  tirana hassan, amnesty international s crisis response director, said in a statement.  the philippine authorities must bring those responsible for torture and other violations to justice and ensure that the victims receive adequate reparations.  major general restituto padilla, armed forces spokesman, said the military was aware of the report and would respond in full later. he said troops were given strict instructions to observe and respect international humanitarian law and human rights.  we will not tolerate and condone these abuses and will act on them,  he told a regular news briefing on friday. the 34 page report,  the battle of marawi: death and destruction in the philippines , quotes a survivor who said he was spared by rebels because he could recite the  shahada , a statement of islamic faith, but a christian ambulance driver was shot dead because he could not do the same.  other survivors said hostages were executed or physically abused, forced into labor and used as human shields.  some hostages who escaped alleged they were detained and tortured by security forces who suspected them to be militants. amnesty said it talked to eight men, including seven christians, who said they were badly treated by the authorities.  i was punched and kicked. they tied our hands and feet with electrical wire,  the report quoted one survivor as saying.  the military was angry because 13 of their men were killed.  last month, u.s. defense secretary jim mattis praised the philippine military for ending the war without a single credible human rights abuse allegation. amnesty noted that the military was responding to concerns about looting by soldiers but  must follow through on promises of compensation .

" china must step up its battle against corruption in order to safeguard against a soviet style collapse, the country s second most senior graft buster said in an editorial on wednesday. yang xiaodu, the deputy secretary of the central commission for discipline inspection, who was promoted to the ruling communist party s 25 strong politburo last month, said failure would risk the  red country changing color . in unusually direct and strongly worded criticism of previous administrations, yang said  in a previous period , corruption had been allowed to fester to such an extent that the party s leadership had weakened, with supervision soft, and ideology apathetic.  it had developed to the point where if not rectified, the country could change color,  yang wrote in the official people s daily.  the future fate of the party and the country s people could follow the same old road to ruin as the soviet union and the eastern bloc.  president xi jinping, like many officials before him, is steeped in the party s long held belief that loosening control too quickly or even at all could lead to chaos and the break up of the country. the party regularly implores cadres to study the collapse of the soviet union in the early 1990s.     yang s editorial is the latest salvo signaling that the intensity of xi s signature war on corruption would not wane despite the departure of xi s right hand man, wang qishan, who was widely seen as china s second most powerful politician before being replaced as anti corruption chief in a leadership reshuffle last month.  wang s replacement, zhao leji, wrote a similarly strongly worded editorial in the people s daily on saturday. yang said xi s anti corruption achievements had been revolutionary in  turning the blade of the knife inward . but he said unhealthy pollutants within the party s political ecosystem had yet to be completely cleansed, and the anti corruption fight remained  grave and complex .  there is no road for retreat, only forward in attack, and definitely no pause or relax,  yang wrote. china has plans for a national supervision law and a new commission next year to oversee the expansion of xi s graft fight. yang, who is also minister of supervision, had been wang s deputy since 2014 and his promotion to the politburo is seen as another display of the importance the central leadership attaches to fighting corruption.

" romania s ruling social democrats have filed a slew of new changes to the criminal code that would decriminalize several graft offences, including some abuse of office crimes, their second attempt this year to weaken a crackdown on corruption. transparency international ranks romania as one of the european union s most corrupt states and brussels keeps its justice system under special monitoring, although it has praised magistrates for their efforts to root out high level graft. a draft bill released on tuesday showed a group of social democrat lawmakers are proposing that abuse of office offences that cause financial damage of less than 200,000 euros ($237,100) should no longer be punishable. other changes include serving prison sentences of less than three years at home, lower sentences for bribe taking and other graft crimes, as well as decriminalizing taking a bribe for someone other than the accused. another proposal would make using one s position to obtain sexual favors no longer a crime.  if approved, the changes would put an end to an ongoing trial of social democrat party leader and lower house speaker liviu dragnea, who is accused of abuse of office.  dozens of lawmakers and mayors across all parties stand to benefit from the changes. romania s anti corruption prosecution unit has sent 72 members of parliament to trial since 2006.  a similar attempt to decriminalize some abuse of office crimes triggered the country s largest street protests in decades at the start of 2017. the ruling coalition backed down at the time but has revived the proposals. earlier this month, the ruling coalition has used its overwhelming parliament majority to approve a judicial overhaul that puts magistrates under political control. they have also filed a different set of proposals to change the criminal code that could derail law and order. thousands of magistrates, centrist president klaus iohannis, the european commission, the u.s. state department and seven eu states have all criticized both the approved bills and the criminal code proposals. the social democrats and their junior coalition partner alde have denied the changes would affect the independence of the judiciary and have stressed that parliament has the right to legislate however it sees fit. the proposed changes place romania alongside its eastern european peers hungary and poland, where populist leaders are also trying to control the judiciary, in defying eu concerns over the rule of law.

" the trump organization inc said on wednesday it has pulled out of a hotel venture in rio de janeiro that is part of a criminal investigation in brazil, with a trump hotels spokeswoman citing construction delays and differences in vision. the trump hotel rio de janeiro, a beachfront property with 170 rooms near where the olympic park was located, was managed by the real estate company of president elect donald trump, although no money from the trump organization was invested in the project. “unfortunately, the developers of the rio de janeiro hotel are significantly behind on the completion of the property, and their vision for the hotel no longer aligns with the trump hotels brand,” jennifer rodstrom, a spokesperson for trump hotels, said in an emailed statement on wednesday.  reuters reported in november that federal prosecutor anselmo lopes had opened a criminal investigation into investments made by two small state pension funds in the hotel. trump hotels declined to comment on whether the decision to pull out of the rio hotel had anything to do with the investigation. when opening the investigation, prosecutor lopes said the size, structure and risk of the investments in the hotel, owned and developed by brazil’s lsh barra empreendimentos imobiliários sa, was suspicious. “it is necessary to verify if the favoritism shown by the pension funds towards lsh barra empreendimentos imobiliários sa and the trump organization was due to illicit payments and bribes,” lopes said at the time. the trump organization and lsh deny any wrongdoing.  plans to build the hotel were announced in 2014, and it was meant to be ready in time for the olympics held in august. delays meant the hotel was only partially open during the games, however, with less than half of its rooms available.

" for months republican presidential candidates traded insults such as “dummy,” “jerk” and “loser.” then, party front runner donald trump repeated a supporter’s description of ted cruz as a “pussy.” with the contest for the party’s nomination moving into south carolina and the stakes rising, it is possible the most disparaging discourse of the nov. 8 election campaign is yet to come.  the epithets may be characteristic of schoolyard bullies, but there is some evidence that candidates are reveling in the attention they draw. the harshest attacks elicit the biggest responses at rallies, on the internet and on cable tv. trump, the billionaire former reality tv star, sent a new hampshire rally into a frenzy on monday when he repeated the term “pussy” shouted by a person in the crowd, effectively questioning cruz’s manliness. trump went on to win the state’s primary the next day, ahead of the third place cruz by a 3 to 1 margin. “it’s one of the reasons i won. you have to be yourself,” trump said in a television interview on nbc’s today show. trump later promised to clean up his foul language and to be more presidential.   history suggests the language could turn even more coarse in the run up to next saturday’s republican nominating contest in south carolina. it was there that u.s. senator john mccain of arizona was accused in 2000 of fathering an illegitimate african american child, and former massachusetts governor mitt romney in 2008 of supporting polygamy.  “these adults are acting like elementary children,”  leslie mcrobbie, a former fifth grade schoolteacher from new hampshire, said of this year’s republican contenders.   president barack obama, a democrat, this week spoke of the snark that characterized a republican race of the past when he recalled that ronald reagan was described by rivals as an “unshapely man” and a “yahoo” before his election as president in 1980. coming off the first nominating contests in iowa and new hampshire, the seven remaining candidates for the republican nomination are under pressure either to break away from the crowd or prevent others from doing so.  insults can foster that. former florida governor jeb bush, mocked more than once by trump as a “low energy” candidate, has since retaliated by tweeting that trump was “not just a loser,” but also a “liar and a whiner.” the put down was re tweeted nearly 3,000 times and “liked” by more than 4,000 users.   cruz, responding to trump’s decision to skip a fox news hosted republican debate, branded his rival “ducking donald” and sponsored a special edition filter on picture sharing app snapchat that featured a blond haired duck with an exaggerated pout meant to represent the real estate mogul. “when we create so much of the modern campaign around the characters that are running, and not on the subjects, the natural byproduct of that is calling people names,” said political scientist michael artime. artime said that while bickering and name calling have always existed in elections, this cycle has seen a notable uptick in the negative. “in the past, if somebody would’ve said what trump said the other night, that would have been a very damaging thing to their campaign,” artime said. “the kind of politics we get is kind of the politics we deserve,” he said.  while many have gleefully or indifferently watched as candidates hurled barb after barb, others have condemned it. “bullying can be highly instrumental and used for social climbing,” said bob faris, associate professor of sociology at university of california davis, who studies aggressive behavior in adolescents. “and it works,” he said, “provided that kids target the right kids.” for trump, perhaps the most blustery of the candidates, the target is constantly changing, his numbers remaining constant in the opinion polls while he assails rivals for being “stupid,” “weak” and “pathetic.” “he does look like a bully,” faris said. “donald is a whole new development. i can’t think of a candidate like him.” presidential historian mike purdy, however, cites a precedent in the late republican president theodore roosevelt. “roosevelt loved more than anything else to be the center of attention, and he had a huge, huge ego,” purdy said. “they both have a certain amount of ego. they both have trouble controlling their mouths,” purdy said, likening roosevelt to trump. purdy said roosevelt called his onetime ally william howard taft a “fathead” during the 1912 presidential campaign, and went on to say then rival taft, seeking re election at the time, had the “brains of a guinea pig.” neither won the race. purdy noted the attacks also came at the expense of substantive political discourse.  “they’re incredibly personal attacks, and they’re not just attacks just on somebody’s position, they’re attacks about personal characteristics,” he said. “that is part of the civility i think we need to recapture.” on friday, trump suggested he agreed. “i do this for effect,” trump said of his foul language in an interview with wor radio in new york. “as we get closer, you will be shocked at how presidential i will be. you will be very proud of me.”  (editing by richard valdmanis and howard goller) sap is the sponsor of this content. it was independently created by reuters’ editorial staff and funded in part by sap, which otherwise has no

" pennsylvania’s $2 billion budget deficit is a “time bomb” that could cause “fiscal catastrophe the likes of which we have never seen” if it is not resolved, governor tom wolf said in his budget address on tuesday. wolf proposed a $32.7 billion fiscal 2017 budget that would add $200 million of funding for k 12 public schools and another $110 million to early and special education programs. including pension contributions, the budget would be nearly $33.3 billion. to pay for the increases, wolf would increase personal income taxes by nearly 11 percent to 3.4 percent, expand sales taxes, raise taxes on tobacco products and implement a 6.5 percent severance tax on natural gas producers, according to documents released during his speech. but dominating wolf’s message was the budgetary crisis escalated by political gridlock. wolf, a democrat, and the republican led legislature have disagreed since this time last year, when wolf proposed his first budget. now seven months after the start of fiscal 2016 on july 1, the state still has only a partial $23.4 billion emergency spending plan. wolf had been ready to sign a negotiated $30.8 billion agreement but it was scuttled in december. wolf reminded lawmakers of that turn of events on tuesday. in web streamed remarks, he urged them to send the agreement back to him. “house republican leaders just walked away,” he said during his speech at the state capitol in harrisburg. some booed in response.  “yelling will not make it go away,” wolf said. “we need to do what’s right,” he continued, to applause. he later told lawmakers to “find another job” if they could not reach a solution. his 2017 proposal is built upon the eventual approval of that compromise budget for the current fiscal year.  senate republicans, who had passed the budget compromise, said wolf was “doubling down” on last year’s proposal. “this retread budget proposal offers superficial changes to his sizable tax and spend plan that has already been soundly opposed by taxpayers,” senate majority leader jake corman said in a statement on tuesday. unless next year’s deficit is closed, property taxes for homeowners will skyrocket, wolf said. more than 23,000 teachers and school employees would be cut, as would special education and pre kindergarten programs.  services for senior citizens, the mentally ill, child care and domestic violence shelters also would be slashed, he said. wolf’s address was no olive branch, said muhlenberg college political scientist christopher borick.  “he turned up the heat,” borick said.

" (editor’s note: this story contains language that may offend some readers in the sixth and final paragraphs adds no comment from gattine spokesman) combative maine governor paul lepage told a radio host on tuesday that he was considering not finishing his term in office, amid a wave of criticism after he left a lawmaker a profanity filled voicemail. but the two term, tea party backed republican governor subsequently appeared to backtrack on the idea, paraphrasing mark twain in a tweet that read in part: “the reports of my political demise are greatly exaggerated.” that message came hours after he told an interviewer on maine’s wvom fm radio that he was “looking at all options,” when asked if he would finish his term, which extends through 2018. lepage’s latest outburst came in response to a report that state representative drew gattine had described him as racist for focusing on black people as bearing primary responsibility for the drug trade in the state. lepage responded to gattine with a blistering, profanity laced voicemail that has been widely circulated. “i’m not going to say that i’m not going to finish it; i’m not saying that i am going to finish it,” lepage said on tuesday in the radio interview, in reference to his term in office. “what i’m going to do right now is i’m taking one step at a time. i want to meet with mr. gattine and then i want to meet with my team at my office and we’re going to look at what the proper steps are to move the state forward.” in last week’s voicemail, lepage called gattine a “little son of a bitch, socialist cocksucker” and encouraged him to share the message publicly “because i am after you.” a lepage spokeswoman did not immediately respond to a request to clarify the governor’s twain tweet. a spokeswoman for gattine said he would not comment until after he met lepage on wednesday. lepage has repeatedly described himself as a less than polished, plain speaking politician. “it’s possible it was a screw up,” said michael franz, chairman of the government department at maine’s bowdoin college, referring to the radio interview. “my first inclination is that this is not serious and that he’s just attempting to establish his regret.” lepage, 67, said he had lost his temper when he was told that gattine had described his views as racist. he told reporters he would like to engage in a duel with gattine, a remark he later described as metaphoric. “i just want to apologize to the maine people, to gattine’s family and most of all to my family,” lepage said in the 15 minute interview. “and we will take action.” some democratic lawmakers have called for a special session of the legislature to censure lepage, who earlier this year fought off an impeachment effort. “a half hearted, partial apology on a radio show does not get remotely close to addressing the core issue: maine faces serious issues and its government is not functioning,” the state’s democratic house leadership said in a statement on tuesday. state senate president michael thibodeau and other republican legislative leaders convened a closed door meeting with lepage late on monday to discuss his future. the governor told the group he was going to talk to friends and family about what he would do next and respond to them on tuesday, said jim cyr, a spokesman for thibodeau. controversial outbursts have marked lepage’s six years in office. earlier this year, he said he did not mean to sound racist when he said drug dealers “with the name d money, smoothie, shifty” were coming to the state to impregnate “white girls.” last week at a news conference lepage compared maine’s efforts to thwart heroin dealers to war. “look, the bad guy is the bad guy,” he said. “i don’t care what color he is ... you try to identify the enemy and the enemy right now, the overwhelming majority of people coming in, are people of color or people of hispanic origin.” in 2013, he told a television interviewer that a political rival “claims to be for the people but he’s the first one to give it to the people without providing vaseline.” ",0
" u.s. president barack obama will meet the dalai lama at the white house on wednesday, a move certain to anger china which considers the exiled tibetan buddhist spiritual leader a dangerous separatist. obama and the dalai lama will meet privately at 10:15 a.m. (1415 gmt), a white house statement said. earlier on tuesday, china warned the united states to stick by its promises not to support any separatist activities. in an interview with reuters on monday, the dalai lama had said it was possible he would meet obama and on tuesday taiwan announced that its new president would make a transit stop in the united states next week. chinese foreign ministry spokesman lu kang said both issues touched on the “one china” policy, a basic diplomatic tenet referring to both taiwan and tibet being part of china that beijing insists foreign governments recognize. lu said the united states had said it opposed taiwan’s independence and recognized that tibet was an inseparable part of china. “we demand the u.s. government earnestly stands by its promises, conscientiously handle the relevant issue in accordance with the one china principle and not give any space to any individual or behavior which tries to create two chinas, one china one taiwan, or to split china,” he said. obama met the dalai lama when the latter visited washington in 2014 and angered china then when he vowed “strong support” for tibetans’ human rights. the dalai lama says he wants genuine autonomy for tibet rather than independence. he told reuters obama was a “a long time friend” whom he admired for his work to normalize relations with cuba, on iran and for his recent visits to former u.s. foe vietnam and the site of the hiroshima atomic bombing in japan.  asked how beijing (peking) might respond to a meeting, the dalai lama said: “i don’t know   you should ask them. i think in peking, we cannot as of now ... generalize. in peking there are different views. some people there have a more realistic view. some are more hardline, which is more narrow minded.”  taiwan president tsai ing wen will transit in miami on her way to panama, one of the island’s few diplomatic allies, and stop over in los angeles on her return, taiwan’s deputy foreign minister, javier ching shan hou, said. china is suspicious of tsai, who assumed office last month, as she is also head of the pro independence democratic progressive party. travel abroad is sensitive for taiwanese leaders who have angered china as it is seen as exerting sovereignty. tsai’s trip will run from june 24 to july 2 and include paraguay.

" china s ruling communist party will meet next month to discuss amending the constitution and to talk about the ongoing fight against graft, state media said on wednesday, ahead of march s expected passing of a new anti corruption law. fighting deeply ingrained graft has been a key policy plank for president xi jinping in his first term in office, and that battle will take on a new hue with the setting up of the national supervision commission as he begins his second term. trial work has already begun for that commission, which is likely to be formally codified in law in march at the meeting of china s largely rubber stamp parliament. the new body will take over from the central commission for discipline inspection (ccdi) and merge multiple anti graft units into a single body. it will also expand the graft campaign s purview to include employees at state backed institutions rather than just party members. in a short report, xinhua news agency said the party s politburo, one of its elite ruling bodies, had met and decided to hold two important meetings next month   one on amending the state constitution and the other specifically on fighting corruption. xinhua gave no details of what the constitutional amendment might entail, but chinese legal scholars have said the country needs to amend its constitution before it can set up the new supervision commission to ensure there is a proper constitutional basis for its powers. the constitution clearly defines china s top political institutions, such as the judiciary and the prosecutor, in order to grant them state power and changes need to be made to these definitions to make room for a similarly powerful supervision system, scholars argue. the party will discuss the amendment, or amendments, at a plenum next month, xinhua said without giving an exact date or saying whether it was one amendment or more. the constitution, which is different from the party constitution, was last amended in 2004 to include guarantees to protect private property and human rights. the other meeting, a full session of the anti corruption watchdog the ccdi, will be held from jan. 11 13, the report added, again without giving details. xi has vowed that his war against graft will not ease until officials at all levels dare not, cannot and do not want to be corrupt. xi told top party leaders in october revision of the anti graft architecture would include the scrapping of a controversial  shuanggui  system of secret interrogations, and the introduction of a new detention system. the latest draft of the new supervision law, unveiled last week, adds protections for graft suspects as part of efforts to revise the interrogation system.

" ousted thai prime minister yingluck shinawatra has fled the country ahead of a verdict against her in a negligence trial brought by the junta that overthrew her, sources close to the shinawatra family said on friday. yingluck, 50, whose family has dominated thai politics for more than 15 years, failed to show up at court for judgment in a case centered on the multi billion dollar losses incurred by a rice subsidy scheme for farmers. overthrown in 2014, yingluck had faced up to 10 years in prison if found guilty. her former commerce minister was jailed in a related case for 42 years on friday.  she has definitely left thailand,  said one source, who is also a member of her puea thai party. the sources did not say where she had gone. yingluck s brother, thaksin shinawatra, who heads the political clan, was overthrown in a 2006 coup and fled into exile to escape a corruption conviction that he said was aimed at demolishing the populist movement he founded. the struggle between that movement and a bangkok centered royalist and pro military elite has been at the heart of years of turmoil in thailand. the verdict against yingluck could have reignited tension, though the army has largely snuffed out open opposition. after yingluck failed to show up, the supreme court issued an arrest warrant against her and rescheduled the verdict to sept. 27. it said it did not believe her excuse that she could not attend the court hearing because of an ear problem.  it is possible that she has fled already,  deputy prime minister prawit wongsuwan told reporters. he later said police were investigating reports that she had left via koh chang, an island close to the cambodian border. cambodian immigration police said she had not entered their country. yingluck last commented on social media on thursday, saying on her facebook page that she would not be able to meet supporters at court because of tight security. she had been banned from traveling abroad at the beginning of the trial in 2015 and has attended previous hearings. the court confiscated the 30 million baht ($900,000) that yingluck had posted as bail. hundreds of her supporters had gathered outside the court on friday where about 4,000 police had been deployed. some held roses while others wore white gloves with the word  love  on them. although yingluck had already been banned from politics by the junta in 2015, she could have been a party figurehead for elections that junta leader prime minister prayuth chan ocha has promised for next year. if yingluck has fled it would disappoint her supporters and make her opponents feel vindicated, said thitinan pongsudhirak, director of the institute of security and international studies at chulalongkorn university.  it does not help with thailand s division and polarization,  he said. under the rice subsidy program, yingluck s administration paid rice farmers up to 50 percent more than market prices. it left thailand with huge rice stockpiles and caused $8 billion in losses. yingluck has said she was only in charge of coming up with the policy but not the day to day management of it.  if she has fled people would not trust her, but the masses would still support her because they benefited from her policies,  38 year old delivery man sakunchai muenlamai. the supreme court sentenced yingluck s former commerce minister, boonsong teriyapirom, to 42 years in jail after finding him guilty of falsifying government to government rice deals between thailand and china in 2013. he said he would appeal, but was told it was too late in the day to apply for bail so will spend the weekend behind bars.

" moody’s investors service on tuesday slapped a negative outlook on kansas’ aa2 credit rating, citing the state’s reliance on one shot measures to balance its budget. that followed action late last month by standard & poor’s, which put kansas’ aa rating on review for a possible downgrade after the state lowered its revenue estimates for the current and next fiscal year by $228.7 million. governor sam brownback plans to divert $185 million in sales tax revenue from the state’ highway fund to the general fund and delay a $96.5 million fiscal 2016 pension payment to help fill the gap.  “by continuing to balance its budget with unsustainable, nonrecurring resources, including pension underfunding, it is accumulating large and expensive long term liabilities that it will be paying off for a long time,” moody’s said in a statement. the credit rating agency also revised the outlook on $2.1 billion of aa2 rated kansas highway revenue bonds to negative from stable. the kansas budget is feeling the effects from action taken by brownback and the republican controlled legislature in recent years to cut corporate and other income taxes to help the state compete with bordering missouri and other states for business development and jobs.   the state’s fiscal year begins on july 1.

" president donald trump’s supreme court appointee neil gorsuch gave a speech to a conservative group on thursday at a hotel in which trump has a financial interest, drawing criticism from protesters outside the building and the top senate democrat. about 50 demonstrators appeared outside the trump international hotel located just blocks from the white house, saying gorsuch’s speech called into question his impartiality as the high court potentially weighs cases involving the republican president, including some involving the hotel itself. “there’s a reason we questioned his independence during his confirmation hearings,” senator chuck schumer said in a statement. gorsuch was confirmed by the republican led u.s. senate to his lifetime position as a justice in april despite unified opposition from democrats who said some of his past rulings favored corporations over ordinary americans and doubted his independence from trump. protester josh orton, a consultant for abortion rights group naral, said if gorsuch continues to make appearances that raise ethics questions “the supreme court will be in danger of losing its sacred reputation as a neutral arbiter of justice.” gorsuch did not address the controversy during his 20 minute speech, instead focusing on the work of the event’s organizer, the fund for american studies, which runs student academic programs and fellowships promoting limited government and free market economics.  he spoke of his job as a justice, saying, “the people and the place are a joy.” he lauded american values such as free speech and civil rights. justices often address a variety of groups across the political spectrum in their spare time. but gorsuch’s speech comes just days before the opening of the u.s. supreme court term in which trump’s administration has a stake in several major cases.  the hotel is a focus of lawsuits accusing trump of violating the u.s. constitution by letting his properties and restaurants accept payments from foreign governments.  “justice gorsuch told the senate during his confirmation that he was committed to the independence and integrity of the judiciary,” said elizabeth wydra, president of the constitutional accountability center, which represents more than 200 members of congress in one of those lawsuits. “his decision to speak at an event that profits the president, however, sadly falls far short of that standard – whether or not speaking at trump’s hotel breaks any explicit ethics rules.” supreme court spokeswoman kathy arberg said gorsuch declined to comment on the ethics issue.

" u.s. and european officials will discuss airline security issues at a meeting in brussels next week, including possibly expanding the number of airports that ban passengers from carrying electronic devices bigger than cellphones aboard flights, a european commission spokeswoman said on friday. u.s. homeland security department secretary john kelly told european ministers by phone friday the department does not plan to immediately unveil any new measures, the eu said. u.s. homeland security spokesman david lapan said no final decision had been made on whether to expand the restrictions, and he declined to immediately confirm kelly’s trip to brussels. “the u.s. and the eu are on the same side when it comes to fighting terrorism and protecting our security,” dimitris avramopoulos, eu commissioner for migration, home affairs and citizenship, said in a statement.  “our phone call today proved once again the strong cooperation we have on these matters. i look forward to welcoming mr kelly and his experts in brussels next week to continue our positive talks.” fears that a bomb could be concealed in electronic devices prompted the united states to announce in march that it would restrict passengers from bringing laptops onto flights originating from 10 airports, including those in the united arab emirates, saudi arabia, qatar and turkey. britain followed suit with restrictions on a slightly different set of routes.         airlines and several countries affected by the electronics ban have pushed for more consultation with american and british regulators after the abrupt introduction of the restrictions took the industry by surprise. u.s. and european carriers are concerned about the logistics of checking large numbers of devices. some airline officials say they would need to hire more staff to impose additional curbs and are worried about how much advance notice they would have. on wednesday, reuters reported that the trump administration is likely to include some european countries in the in cabin electronics ban.  some u.s. and european airlines have been planning for a wider ban, industry officials have told reuters. european regulators have warned that placing hundreds of devices in the hold on long haul flights could also compromise safety by increasing the risk of fire from poorly deactivated lithium ion batteries. the eu said in a document approved thursday and reviewed by reuters that it did not “have information that would require the adoption of additional security measures, such as the restrictions being considered by the u.s authorities.” the eu document added that placing laptops in luggage holds “presents an increased safety risk to the aircraft, due to the lithium batteries contained in such devices.” kelly briefed members of congress on thursday and held a meeting with high level executives of delta air lines (dal.n), united airlines (ual.n), american airlines group inc (aal.o) and airlines for america, a trade group. a congressional official said homeland security was likely to expand the ban soon but did not say when or to what airports. the airlines declined to comment, but an airline official said government officials suggested an expansion of the ban was expected soon but it wasn’t certain when.  the trade group said in a statement it appreciated the meeting “to discuss the current state of aviation security.” the group voted to work with government officials to “minimize the impact on the traveling public by utilizing the risk based solutions that are the core of our foundation as the safest aviation system in the world.” in 2016, 30 million people flew to the united states from europe, according to u.s. transportation department data. according to airports association aci europe, summer schedules for 2017 at airports in 28 european union countries show there are 3,257 flights per week to the united states. kelly said last month the ban was likely to expand, given the sophisticated threats in aviation and intelligence findings that would be attackers were trying to hide explosives in electronic devices. the predicament is reminiscent of the aviation industry’s response to the 2014 downing of malaysian airlines flight mh17.  at the time, airlines called for greater sharing of information about potential threats to commercial aircraft from conflict zones, even as intelligence agencies expressed reluctance over the risk of revealing sources.

" israel plans to appoint a new ambassador to jordan in a bid to calm amman s anger over the current envoy s handling of a shooting by an embassy guard in july that has strained relations, an israeli diplomatic source said on wednesday.  but israel has shown no sign of meeting jordan s demand that it launch criminal proceedings against the guard, who killed two jordanians in what he called self defence. he was repatriated along with ambassador einat schlein a day after the incident.  jordanian authorities say they suspect the shooting was unprovoked but could not investigate the guard due to his diplomatic immunity. a televised welcome he and schlein received from israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu outraged amman. since schlein s departure on july 24 the embassy has been shuttered, casting a pall over israel s ties with jordan, a u.s. backed regional security partner and one of only two arab countries that recognise israel. the 1994 peace deal with israel is unpopular among many jordanians, who often identify with the palestinians.  an israeli diplomatic source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said schlein would not return.  the jordanians don t want her back, and this has been a big obstacle in patching things up,  the source said.  we re looking for a replacement.  emmanuel nahshon, spokesman for israel s foreign ministry, said:  we are working on a solution that will bring the relations back on track.  israel says the guard opened fire after being attacked and lightly wounded by a workman, killing him and a jordanian bystander. israeli officials have said they were looking into the possibility of compensating the family of the second man.  they say it is highly unlikely israel would prosecute the guard, as demanded by jordan. his prospects of continued work in israeli diplomatic security abroad were in doubt, however, after a jordanian newspaper published his name and photograph. israel s consulates in turkey have been handling jordanian applications for israeli visas since the incident.

" a group holding more than $10 billion of puerto rican debt wants the island’s federally appointed financial oversight board to postpone a wednesday deadline to approve a fiscal turnaround plan for puerto rico, saying the u.s. territory’s creditors should have input on the plan.  a bondholder group led by oppenheimerfunds and franklin advisers, which hold debt across a wide swath of puerto rican credits, made the request to the board in a letter made public on monday morning, ahead of the board’s scheduled public meeting in new york. “an extension would ... allow puerto rico and the oversight board to work with puerto rico’s key stakeholders to develop a fiscal plan that makes sense to all the parties,” the group said.  the turnaround plan, a requirement of the puerto rico rescue law known as promesa, must be submitted by governor ricardo rossello and approved by the seven member board in charge of managing the island’s finances. the plan is meant to serve as the basis for looming restructuring talks with holders of puerto rico’s $70 billion in debt.  so far, rossello and the board have disagreed about what the blueprint should look like, with the board saying an initial draft by rossello relied on overly optimistic revenue and growth projections. the draft increased 10 year cash flows by $33.8 billion, through spending cuts and new revenues, and contemplated $1.2 billion a year in debt service   only 30 percent of what it owes next fiscal year. the board on monday is expected to take up a revised version of the plan from rossello, and has said it wants to approve a final version by wednesday. but the lingering disagreements between the board and rossello call for an extension, the oppenheimer group said in monday’s letter, adding that more time might give the island’s creditors a seat at the table. oppenheimer said rossello’s draft plan was unfeasible, saying it ignored payment priorities, offered too weak an analysis on debt sustainability, and did not go far enough on tax reform measures.  puerto rico is trying to stem rampant out migration, reduce a 45 percent poverty rate, and fix near insolvent public healthcare and pension systems. oppenheimer said it supported extending through dec. 31 a stay on litigation arising from debt defaults, so sides can negotiate a debt restructuring without worrying about lawsuits.  ",0

" the pentagon’s acquisition chief said on wednesday she wants to cut the time for major procurements to 12 months from an average of 2.5 years, speaking during a congressional hearing on the reorganization of the defense department’s procurement system. the pentagon typically takes months and often years to make procurement decisions, especially for major weapons programs. a more rapid procurement process could accelerate the pace of orders for weapons makers like lockheed martin corp and northrop grumman corp. during the hearing of the u.s. senate armed services committee, panel chairman senator john mccain called the pentagon’s buying program a “system of organized irresponsibility.” the pentagon’s chief weapons buyer, undersecretary of defense for acquisition, technology, and logistics ellen lord, was asked her goal for cutting back time for weapons procurement and she responded “12 months for major programs.” lord, who began working at the pentagon in august, was formerly chief executive of defense contractor textron systems, an aerospace and defense company that makes drones and missiles. if the acquisition process is shortened it would be good for larger weapons makers because time is money, byron callan, a defense analyst at capital alpha partners, said in an interview. the move could also increase competition from smaller companies that often lack the financial resources to wait out lengthy pentagon procurements, he said.  the pentagon’s weapons procurement process generally begins by soliciting proposals from industry, often includes a competitive process to find a vendor, as well as product testing before delivery and final payment. critics say the decision making part of the current procurement process takes too long and could be reduced. mark esper, secretary of the army, said his office was examining a way to reduce the requirements development process, where the military articulates the concept of what it needs, to 12 months from five years. the 2017 national defense authorization act (ndaa) changed the structure of the pentagon’s office of acquisition by splitting it into two new positions, an undersecretary for research and engineering focusing on innovation, and an undersecretary for acquisition and sustainment focusing on program management.  that process is still unfolding, but during the hearing testimony showed the initial effect was that decision making for some procurement processes had moved to individual branches of the u.s. military.

" u.s. president donald trump said on thursday that he and chinese president xi jinping would be focusing “very strongly” on the u.s opioid crisis, which he has declared a public health emergency. trump said shortly before arriving in beijing he would discuss as a “top priority” stopping the “flood of cheap and deadly” fentanyl “manufactured in china” when he meets xi. “every year drug trafficking destroys millions and millions of lives,” trump said in beijing, standing next to xi at the end of formal talks between the two. “today president xi and i discussed ways we can enhance coordination to better counter the deadly drug trade and to stop the lethal flow of poisonous drugs into our countries and into our communities,” he added. “a special emphasis will be placed on the new phenomenon   fentanyl   destroying lives by the millions. we’re going to be focusing on it very strongly, the president and myself,” trump said, without elaborating. speaking later to reporters, u.s. secretary of state rex tillerson said trump and xi agreed to take new steps. “on the critical issue of opioids, we made some good progress to curb the flow of harmful narcotics into the united states in order to save american lives,” tillerson said.  “the president committed to taking new actions including agreements to control the export and movement of fentanyl precursors, sharing intelligence on drug trafficking, and exchanging trafficking information,” he added, referring to xi. china’s drug control agency last week disputed trump’s claim that most of the synthetic drug fentanyl at the heart of the u.s. opioid crisis was produced in china. opioids include prescription painkillers, heroin and fentanyl, a highly addictive synthetic drug 50 to 100 times more potent than morphine. the centers for disease control estimated that 20,000 americans were killed by fentanyl last year, surpassing common painkillers and heroin for the first time. american law enforcement agencies and drug control experts say most of the fentanyl distributed in the united states, as well as precursor chemicals, originate from china. while chinese officials dispute these claims, beijing has taken steps to crack down on the production and export of synthetic drugs, and has placed fentanyl and 22 other related compounds on its list of controlled substances.

" mali and niger, two of the west african nations worst affected by jihadist violence, appealed on wednesday for international funding for a regional force they have set up to counter islamist insurgencies. mali s president ibrahim boubacar keita and niger s mahamadou issoufou said the force assembled by the g5 sahel bloc   mali, mauritania, burkina faso, niger and chad   was crucial to fighting a threat that went well beyong their borders.  we bring this combat against terrorism not only to protect our own people and countries but for the whole world,  issoufou told a news conference in niger s capital niamey.   for terrorism knows no border. it will go to europe, it will go to the united states,  he said.  the world has to be mobilized.  the idea of the g5 force was first dreamed up in 2015, but only in july last year did the countries set it up. it is expected to comprise around 5,000 troops. french president emmanuel macron has said he expects it to be operational by the autumn. islamist groups, some with links to al qaeda, seized mali s desert north in 2012. french led forces scattered them the following year but they still attack peacekeepers, soldiers and civilian targets in mali, niger, burkina faso and ivory coast.  issoufou said a multinational force in the lake chad region, including soldiers from niger, nigeria, chad and cameroon, had had some success against islamist boko haram militants, but that this was financed by africa s biggest economy, nigeria, whereas no country in the g5 had sufficient resources.  it is important that the international community takes note of this and gets together to give us resources to ensure our mission can be accomplished,  he said. analysts see the g5 force as the basis of an eventual exit strategy for around 4,000 french troops deployed to the region on counter insurgency missions, mostly in mali.  we have only limited means, but if we mutualize our power, our sovereign elements will have more force, more vitality than we imagine,  malian president keita said. issoufou said the force would be divided into three deployments across the sahel region: an eastern one consisting of chadian and nigerien forces, a central one with forces from niger, mali and burkina faso, and a western one with troops from mali and mauritania.

" anthony scaramucci, president donald trump’s new communications director, said on sunday that one of his first tasks will be to halt leaks and that staff on his team would be fired if the leaks do not stop. “if we don’t get the leaks stopped, i am a businessperson, and so i will take dramatic action to stop those leaks,” scaramucci said on fox news sunday. scaramucci told cbs’s face the nation that leakers are “actually un american,” and that he would lead a team meeting on monday.  the hiring of scaramucci, a wall street financier and republican fundraiser, brings a combative style to the white house press office as president donald trump lashes out at probes into whether his campaign colluded with russians during the 2016 campaign. special counsel robert mueller is looking into any relationships or contacts between trump campaign officials and russia during the election, but trump has not been accused of any wrongdoing by federal investigators.   white house press secretary sean spicer, who became a household name in his short and turbulent drama filled term, quickly resigned after scaramucci’s appointment. sarah sanders, spicer’s deputy, was promoted to press secretary. scaramucci was forced to deal with leaks on his first days on the job after the washington post reported last week that trump and his legal team had examined presidential powers to pardon aides, family members and potentially himself. trump wrote on twitter on saturday that leaks against the administration are a “crime” and that he has “complete power to pardon.” scaramucci said trump only tweeted about the issue of pardons in reaction to the leak. trump “doesn’t like the fact that he has a two minute conversation in the oval office or in his study and that people are running out and leaking,” about the administration examining legal options of pardons, scaramucci, who reports directly to trump, said on cbs. “there’s no need for him to pardon anybody,” he said.     and scaramucci, who has at times supported democrats, spent part of the weekend deleting some of his own past tweets on subjects that run counter to trump administration policy, such as taking action on climate change. explaining the deletions, scaramucci wrote on twitter that “past views evolved & shouldn’t be a distraction.”       ",0

" president donald trump told congress on tuesday that more needs to be done to bring down “artificially high” prices for prescription drugs, while at the same time praising a drug that turns out to cost $300,000 per year. during the televised address, trump acknowledged in the audience megan crowley, a college student who has pompe disease   a rare muscle disorder that can be treated with an expensive enzyme replacement therapy.  “but our slow and burdensome approval process at the food and drug administration keeps too many advances, like the one that saved megan’s life, from reaching those in need,” the president said. “if we slash the restraints, not just at the fda but across our government, then we will be blessed with far more miracles like megan.” trump has in the past excoriated drugmakers for charging “astronomical” prices, while acknowledging how “complicated” the nation’s healthcare system is. representatives of the trump administration could not immediately be reached for comment on wednesday on whether the president believes the treatment price for pompe disease is fair.  trump’s comments on tuesday night highlight an issue central to the industry and investors   the potential for deregulation of the fda, the agency charged with approving pharmaceutical products. “i think trump used this example somewhat cynically as a way of trying to advance the deregulatory agenda,” said dr. aaron kesselheim, a researcher at harvard medical school. “the fda’s standards actually promote innovation because patients don’t want just any old drug   they want drugs that work.” megan’s father, john crowley, now chief executive at amicus therapeutics inc, started a biotech company in 1998 to seek a treatment for pompe disease.  in 2006, the fda   after a nine month review   approved infused enzyme replacement therapy myozyme for patients born with the condition. a similar drug, lumizyme, was approved in 2010 for late onset pompe disease and is now used regardless of a patient’s age.  the average annual cost of treatment is $298,000, according to paris based sanofi sa, which now owns the drugs. under the orphan drug act of 1983, drugs for rare diseases   defined as those that treat fewer than 200,000 patients   are given a range of incentives including seven years of marketing exclusivity.    “pharmaceutical companies know they get a free pass for very expensive drugs for orphan diseases, whereas they don’t for mainstream diseases,” said joel hay, professor of pharmaceutical economics and policy at the university of southern california. the national organization for rare disorders (nord) applauded trump’s recognition, but disagreed with the idea that the regulatory process needs an overhaul.     “our patients deserve the same quality therapies as everyone else, and to weaken the standards will only threaten our population with unsafe, ineffective therapies,” nord said in a statement on wednesday.      pompe disease, affecting 5,000 to 10,000 people worldwide, prevents the body from making enough of an enzyme used by heart and muscle cells to convert a form of sugar called glycogen into energy. when glycogen builds up in these cells it can lead to disability and death. nord estimates that around 30 million americans suffer from 7,000 rare diseases.

" some northern chinese cities failed to improve air quality by much last month, hitting the smog prone region s overall results in a drive against pollution, the government said as it warned provincial officials to comply with stringent steps to clear the skies.  some cities did not improve air quality by much or even experienced some volatility, and in a way, they have dragged down the regional air quality level,  ministry of environmental protection (mep) spokesperson, liu youbin, said at a regular briefing on thursday. he did not identify the underperforming cities, but the comment comes amid concerns about the country s ability to reduce pollution in winter as it battles to avoid a repeat of the near record levels of choking smog that enveloped key northern areas at the start of the year.  there is no jesting in war. for those local officials who do not enforce the measures of the campaign effectively and could not improve air quality in time, we will hold them accountable,  liu added. data earlier this month showed only four of 28 northern chinese cities met their air quality targets in october and air quality in 338 chinese cities worsened in october, with levels of hazardous breathable particles, known as pm 2.5, up 5.6 percent on the year to an average of 38 micrograms per cubic meter.      beijing is under huge pressure to meet politically crucial air quality targets and clear the skies of toxic smog that blankets the north of the country as homes turn up the heat which is powered by coal. liu said overall air quality in the northern cities was improving compared with september. average pm 2.5 levels in the region dropped 15.8 percent in october from the month before, he said.   it shows that our measures are working. as long as we are persistent, and diligently enforce existing measures, regional air quality will definitely improve,  he said.  under the six month campaign, 28 northern chinese cities were ordered to thin traffic and cut industrial output. thousands of pollution sources including steel mills, coal fired boilers, cement and ceramic plants, mines and building sites will be shut. these measures, part of beijing s years long time war on smog, have already roiled commodities market, fuelling worries that the tough inspections are hurting the already slowing economy.

" the democrat controlled illinois legislature ended its spring session late tuesday, failing to produce a full fiscal 2017 budget to tackle financial woes or even a plan to fund schools. hours before the session ended republican governor bruce rauner chastised democrats for their “stunning failure” on the budget front. “we’re like a banana republic. we can’t manage our money,” he said at a news conference. a house passed budget that rauner vowed to veto for being more than $7 billion short on revenue failed badly in a senate vote. illinois has limped through fiscal 2016 as the only u.s. state without a complete budget, operating under court ordered spending, and continuing and stopgap appropriations.  the governor last year vetoed all but a school funding bill in the democrats’ budget for the fiscal year that ends june 30.  the impasse between rauner and democrats showed no sign of easing and could leave the nation’s fifth largest state runningon a similar autopilot as the new fiscal year begins july 1. vendors, social services providers, state universities, community colleges and others that have received partial or no funding over the last year are reaching breaking point. that in turn could bring widespread operational problems if the state is unable to obtain food, utilities, fuel and other essentials. “real people are going to suffer. real people are going to die,” warned democratic state representative jack franks. the legislature also failed to approve a stand alone k 12 education budget. a $15.7 billion bill to ensure schools open in the fall passed the senate but was soundly defeated in the house.  its demise leaves the financially struggling chicago public schools (cps) without an additional $475 million in funding in part to help pay for rising contributions to teacher pensions. cps officials have warned of “draconian” spending cuts to deal with a $1 billion budget deficit. democratic leaders on tuesday refused to immediately take up rauner’s short term budget plan, shunting it off to a bipartisan working group. future budget deliberations will be complicated by the fact that a tougher, three fifths voting majority to pass a bill kicks in on wednesday.  house speaker michael madigan has made clear his chamber will meet every week during june to work on a budget.  the inability to send rauner a spending plan exposed an unusual level of dysfunction within the democratic party, whose super majorities in both legislative chambers were racked by infighting over how best to confront the 11 month impasse with the governor. the senate’s refusal to adopt a budget plan bearing the clear imprint of madigan, the state party chairman, represented a stinging rebuke to the longest serving statehouse speaker in america and a setback rauner allies called a “catastrophe” for democrats. within the 39 member senate democratic majority, some senators complained they were unable to have input in the house passed plan, which arrived last week as a take it or leave it proposition, one of madigan’s legislative hallmarks over the years in his dealings with illinois’ upper legislative chamber. “there was a lot of resentment over the way it was passed,” said senate president john cullerton. without a budget, illinois, which already has the lowest bond ratings among the 50 states, risks harming its credit standing further. credit rating agencies have warned of downgrades if the state fails to tackle its $111 billion unfunded pension liability and huge structural budget deficit. the governor’s budget office has hired consultants to help disengage from interest rate swap pacts that could cost the state more than $100 million if its ratings fall below specified levels.

" two years after militants killed 130 people in coordinated attacks across paris, french officials say there remains an unprecedented level of  internal  threat from both within and outside the country. with islamic state losing ground in iraq and syria, hundreds of french citizens   and in some cases their children   have started to return to france, leaving the government in a quandary over how to deal with them. for the first time as president, emmanuel macron will pay tribute on monday to the victims of the mass shootings and suicide bombing that took place across paris and in the city s northern suburb of saint denis on nov. 13, 2015. the attacks, the deadliest on french soil since world war two, prompted the country to strike back, joining international military operations targeting is and other islamist militant groups in iraq, syria, libya and elsewhere. there has also been the passage of more stringent french legislation, with the most recent law, effective this month, giving police extended powers to search properties, conduct electronic eavesdropping and shut mosques or other locations suspected of preaching hatred. conservative politicians say the regulations don t go far enough, while human rights groups express alarm, saying security forces are being given too much freedom to curtail rights.  macron   often parodied for his  on the one hand, on the other hand  policy pronouncements   has emphasized the need to balance security and liberty. while he has ended the state of emergency brought in after the attacks, heavily armed soldiers still patrol the streets of paris daily, and barely a week goes by without a police operation to round up suspects.  according to the interior ministry, extraordinary measures have helped intelligence agencies thwart more than 30 attacks in the last two years. last week, the police arrested nine people and another was apprehended in switzerland in a coordinated counter terrorism operation.   what worries us are plans for terrorist attacks prepared by teams that are still operating in fighting zones in syria and iraq,  laurent nunez, head of france s internal intelligence agency dgsi told french daily le figaro in a rare interview. the risk of a home grown attack also remains strong, with a risk of more attacks from isolated individuals using  low cost  methods such as cars or knives to kill, he said. the hypothesis of a car bomb attack or suicide bomber cannot be excluded either although his services had not uncovered any such plan, he said. of particular concern is what to do about hundreds of french citizens who went to fight with is and may now seek to return home, now that the militant group has lost nearly all the territory its self proclaimed caliphate ruled in syria and iraq.  we know that the will of the jihadists to take action is intact,  nunez said. visiting abu dhabi last week, macron said those returning would be studied on  a case by case  basis.  some of them will be coming back (by their own means), others will be repatriated and some, in specific circumstances, will be facing trial with their families in the countries where they are currently, iraq in particular,  he said.  a majority doesn t want to come back to france given the legal proceedings they face upon their return. but some women, widows, with their children, are inclined to travel back,  french prosecutor francois molins said.  we should not be naive. we are dealing with people who are more  disappointed  than  sorry.

" tens of thousands of indians voted in the first stage of assembly elections in the western state of gujarat on saturday, where prime minister narendra modi faces his toughest electoral test since coming to power with a landslide victory in 2014. modi has himself led the campaign to ensure that his bharatiya janata party (bjp) retains power in his home state, as a combined opposition mounted the biggest challenge ahead of the general election in 2019.   three big polls carried out in the run up to the vote on saturday and next week have predicted a victory for bjp but with a greatly reduced majority. voters started turning up early in the morning and some had to wait for about 15 minutes due to a malfunction in the electronic voting machine. in the first few hours, more than 15 percent of voters in surendranagar district cast their ballot, according to state government officials. an abp cds poll this week gave the bjp 91 99 seats in the 182 member state house and the main opposition congress 78 86, suggesting a close fight. to win, a party needs 92 seats.   the surveys have often gone wrong, though, and modi himself remains far more popular across the country than his rivals, including rahul gandhi who is leading the congress charge to weaken modi in his home base.   votes from the election will be counted on dec. 18 and the results announced the same day.   in the first stage of state assembly elections on saturday, 977 candidates are trying their luck in 89 constituencies spread across 19 districts of gujarat, according to the election commission. more than 21 million people will vote during the first stage of the election on saturday. modi has thrown himself into the campaign, addressing dozens of rallies over the past month, saying he alone could deliver on development. gujarati businesses, which form the core of modi s support base, have complained that the goods and services tax introduced this year and late last year s shock move to abolish 500 and 1,000 rupee bank notes, accounting for 86 percent of cash in circulation, aggravated already tough economic conditions. hindu majority gujarat is one of india s richest and fastest growing states but also one of its most communally divided. about 1,000 people, mostly muslims, were killed after a wave of riots rocked gujarat in 2002, when modi was chief minister. a supreme court investigation found no case against modi, who denied any wrongdoing.

" iran has remained within the main limits on its nuclear activity set by its 2015 deal with six world powers, the u.n. atomic watchdog said in its first report since u.s. president donald trump decertified iranian compliance with the terms. iran undertook to curb its uranium enrichment program in return for relief from international sanctions that crippled its economy, and u.n. nuclear inspectors have repeatedly verified tehran s adherence to the key aspects of the accord. trump has called the agreement between iran, the united states, britain, france, germany, russia, china and the european union  the worst deal ever  and he disavowed iran s compliance last month. his decision did not constitute a u.s. exit from the accord but raised concern about its staying power. trump s move, at odds with the commitment of the other parties to the deal, meant the u.s. congress must decide by mid december whether to reimpose economic sanctions lifted under the accord, reached under his predecessor barack obama. if congress reimposes the sanctions, the united states would in effect be in violation of the deal and it would likely fall apart. if lawmakers do nothing, the deal remains in place. in response, iranian supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei has said tehran will stick to the nuclear accord as long as the other signatories respected it, but would  shred  the deal if washington pulled out. if the deal unravels, it would strengthen hardline opponents of hassan rouhani, iran s pragmatist president who opened up diplomatic channels to western powers to enable nuclear diplomacy after years of worsening confrontation. iran s stock of low enriched uranium as of nov. 5 was 96.7 kg (213.2 pounds), well below a 202.8 kg limit set by the deal, and the level of enrichment did not exceed a maximum 3.67 percent cap, said the confidential international atomic energy agency report sent to iaea member states and seen by reuters. iran s stock of so called heavy water, a moderator used in a type of reactor that can produce plutonium, a potential nuclear bomb fuel, stood at 114.4 metric tonnes, below a 130 tonne limit agreed by the parties to the deal. the 3.67 percent enrichment and 202 kg stockpile limit on uranium, and the 130 tonne cap on heavy water, aim to ensure that iran does not amass enough material of sufficient fissile purity to produce a nuclear bomb. such a device requires uranium to be refined to around 90 percent purity. iaea director general yukiya amano told reuters in september he would welcome clarification from the powers on how the agency should monitor iran s implementation of the so called section t of the nuclear pact that deals with certain technologies that could be used to develop an atom bomb. russia had been critical of the agency s monitoring of section t provisions, but monday s report said the iaea had verified iran s commitment to the section.

" qatar will buy fighter jets and armored vehicles as part of 12 billion euros worth of commercial contracts it agreed with france on thursday, bolstering its military capability and its international ties as it faces a boycott by other arab states. the latest contracts underscored how doha can use the wealth it has accumulated as the world s biggest exporter of liquefied natural gas to defy some of the largest and wealthiest arab countries. saudi arabia, the united arab emirates, bahrain and egypt cut diplomatic and trade relations with the emirate almost six months ago. they accuse the qataris of backing terrorism, which qatar denies.  our position on this blockade was very clear. qatar s position was very clear   to resolve this problem, if we saw problems between us and our neighbors   we should be at a table and speak honestly,  emir sheikh tamim bin hamad al thani said at a news conference alongside french president emmanuel macron. macron, who has tried to play a mediation role between the sides, was in doha to discuss how to combat the financing of terrorism at a time when the middle east is locked in a regional power struggle between sunni saudi arabia and shi ite iran.  restoring stability to the gulf is a priority for us because we have a lot of friends here,  macron said.  our wish is that we find a quick resolution to today s situation.  paris has strong commercial and political ties with qatar. it has promoted deeper business interests in the country and encouraged qatari investment in france, where the gulf state already has assets of about $10 billion. macron said some 12 billion euros ($14.13 billion) worth of deals were agreed on thursday. they included qatar s taking up an option from 2015 to buy 12 more dassault aviation made rafale fighters, and saying it could purchase a further 36. it has already bought 24 planes for about 6 billion euros, including missiles. it also committed to buying 490 armored vehicles from defense firm nexter.  doha has repeatedly called for dialogue with its neighbors, although it has strengthened its military as relations with them have deteriorated. it has secured this year alone military equipment deals with the united states, russia and britain.   in total, it amounts to nearly 12 billion euros which was signed today and which underlines the closeness of our economic cooperation,  macron said. among other deals signed, suez sevi.pa will dredge and clean qatar s lagoon and a rail consortium of ratp and sncf will build and operate a metro system in the qatari capital. qatar airways also placed a new order for airbus a321neo civilian aircraft to replace an earlier a320neo order. the new deal for larger planes is worth an extra $930 million at current list prices for airbus and involves a switch of engine supplier to a french american venture co owned by safran (saf.pa)< and general electric (ge.n).

" one of the most powerful democrats in the u.s. congress on tuesday pressed president elect donald trump to keep the consumer financial watchdog agency’s current director, as rumors about a possible termination and replacement swirled.  senate democratic leader chuck schumer told reporters that trump will break his campaign promise of “standing up for workers and consumers against the rigged system” if he fires the u.s. consumer financial protection bureau’s (cfpb) director, richard cordray, after taking office on friday. “if trump intends to keep any of his promises and un rig the system, he would keep rich cordray,” the senator from new york said in a phone call with reporters. created in the 2010 dodd frank wall street reform law, the cfpb has battled all sorts of lenders through regulation and litigation. it most recently participated in a settlement with wells fargo for $190 million for allegedly creating ghost accounts.      by law, the president can only fire the agency’s director for cause, but a recent federal court decision says the u.s. chief executive should be able to dismiss the director at will. that decision has been stayed pending appeal. some want trump to not wait for the appeals court and fire cordray for cause as soon as he becomes president. at the earliest, the full u.s. court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit is expected to announce in february whether it will review the case. last week, trump met with one of the agency’s biggest critics, former republican representative randy neugebauer of texas, who is frequently mentioned as a top choice for to replace cordray. conservatives say neugebauer would limit the reach of the cfpb, which they say has gone too far and does not have enough accountability. congress is controlled by the republican party, and most republicans would prefer having a commission in charge of the agency, instead of a director who both creates and enforces rules. during the call with reporters, schumer characterized the possibility of making neugebauer director as an attempt to dismantle the cfpb from the inside. also on the call, senator elizabeth warren of massachusetts said removing cordray would allow trump to block the cfpb’s current work on rules on mandatory arbitration, payday lending and debt collection. democrats like warren, who came up with the idea of an agency to protect individuals’ finances after the 2007 09 crisis, say the cfpb is an important guard against fraud in mortgages, student loans and other consumer products.

" iran promised on monday to give a  crushing  response if the united states designated its elite revolutionary guards as a terrorist group. the pledge came a week before president donald trump announces a final decision on how he wants to contain the islamic republic.  he is expected on oct. 15 to  decertify  a landmark 2015 international deal to curb iran s nuclear program, a step that by itself stops short of pulling out of the agreement but gives congress 60 days to decide whether to reimpose sanctions. trump is also expected to designate iran s most powerful security force, the islamic revolutionary guards corp (irgc) as a terrorist organization, as he rolls out a broader, more hawkish u.s. strategy on iran.   we are hopeful that the united states does not make this strategic mistake,  foreign ministry spokesman bahram qasemi was quoted as saying by the state news agency irna.  if they do, iran s reaction would be firm, decisive and crushing and the united states should bear all its consequences,  he told a news conference reported by irna. individuals and entities associated with the irgc are already on the u.s. list of foreign terrorist organizations, but the organization as a whole is not. irgc commander mohammad ali jafari said on sunday,  if the news is correct about the stupidity of the american government in considering the revolutionary guards a terrorist group, then the revolutionary guards will consider the american army to be like islamic state all around the world.  jafari also said that additional sanctions would end chances for future dialogue with the united states and that the americans would have to move their regional bases outside the 2,000 km (1,250 mile) range of irgc s missiles. u.s. sanctions on the irgc could affect conflicts in iraq and syria, where tehran and washington both support warring parties that oppose the islamic state militant group (is). france said on monday it was worried that classifying the irgc as a terrorist group could exacerbate tensions in the region. germany said it was worried trump would decide iran is not respecting the nuclear deal, negotiated under his predecessor barack obama, and fears such a step will worsen insecurity in the middle east.  a u.s. pullout could unravel an accord seen by supporters as vital to preventing a middle east arms race and tamping down regional tensions, since it limits iran s ability to enrich uranium for nuclear fuel in exchange for the lifting of sanctions that damaged its oil based economy. the u.n. nuclear watchdog s inspectors have repeatedly declared iran in compliance with the terms of the nuclear deal.  trump called iran  a corrupt dictatorship  during his first speech to the u.n. general assembly and said the nuclear deal was  the worst and most one sided transactions the united states has ever entered into . the other five world powers in the deal were britain, france, germany, russia and china. the prospect of the united states reneging on the agreement has worried other partners that helped negotiate it. the kremlin said that any u.s. withdrawal from the nuclear deal would have  negative consequences.   british prime minister theresa may, who supports the nuclear pact, and israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu, who opposes it, agreed in a phone call on monday that they need to be  clear eyed  about the threat iran poses to the middle east.  they agreed that ... the international community should continue working together to push back against iran s destabilizing regional activity,  may s spokesman said. despite the nuclear deal, washington still maintains its own more limited sanctions on iran over its ballistic missile program and over accusations tehran supports terrorism. iran says it is developing missiles solely for defensive purposes and denies involvement in terrorism.  the trump administration aims to put more pressure on the irgc, especially over recent missile tests and what washington has called its  malign activities  across the middle east. the u.s. government imposed sanctions in july on 18 entities and people for supporting the irgc in developing drones and military equipment. in august, congress overwhelmingly approved the  countering america s adversaries through sanctions act  which imposed new sanctions on iran for its ballistic missile program, as well as sanctions on russia and north korea. in an interview aired on saturday night, trump accused iran of  funding north korea  and  doing things with north korea that are totally inappropriate . qasemi, iran s foreign ministry spokesman, said the u.s. accusations were  baseless . he added,  israel and some specific countries are raising these accusations to create iranophobia.

" while revelations that donald trump jr. welcomed russian help in last year’s presidential election roil washington, asking about it along southern ohio’s appalachian highway can draw some pretty strange looks. in the mostly rural, heavily baptist and predominately trump supporting terrain, the collective reaction ranges from   ignorance about the russia investigation, to a belief that some media want to destroy republican president donald trump and his  family, to complete disinterest.  many of the 20 people interviewed in several ohio towns were dismissive of the barrage of headlines about a june 2016 meeting between trump’s eldest son donald jr. and a woman he was told was a russian government lawyer who might have damaging information about democratic election rival hillary clinton. the revelation was made when trump jr. released a series of emails on tuesday amid investigations of u.s. intelligence agency conclusions that moscow sought to help trump win. russia has denied allegations of interfering in the election and trump has denied his campaign colluded with russian officials, sometimes dismissing the notion as “fake news.” in little hocking, ohio, lisa walker, 54, runs a small thrift shop. wearing a t shirt emblazoned with the american flag, she says her husband has expressed fears that somebody is going to try and assassinate trump. she and her husband voted for trump. she has followed the revelations about the younger trump on the news. she sees the russia investigation as proof that “people are out to get trump. i would hope they have better things to do than play games and attack trump.” similarly, in jackson and piketon, ohio, donald trump jr.’s troubles appeared to strengthen support for his father and trump family members who many in the area see as embattled victims. in hillsboro, the county seat of highland county, the editor of the hillsboro times gazette, gary abernathy, says many people in the county believe the media is trying to destroy trump. “it just plays into the belief here that the media is fixated on all things russia,” said abernathy, whose newspaper was one of only six in the united states to have endorsed trump for president during the election campaign. “i don’t mind donald trump being treated critically or aggressively, but not in a way that is an effort to drag him down. donald trump jr. had one 20 minute meeting with a lawyer from russia and it’s wall to wall coverage.” trump won highland county with more than 76 percent of the vote, 12 points more than the 2012 republican presidential candidate mitt romney won, part of a surge in votes for trump in many midwestern rural counties that was a significant factor in his victory. donald jr.’s meeting stirred more questions and reporting about possible collusion or whether any u.s. laws were broken. under the u.s. federal election campaign act, it is illegal for a foreign national to contribute to a u.s. political campaign. before the latest disclosures, americans overall were  sharply divided on what to make of reports about trump and russia. according to a reuters/ipsos poll in june, 50 percent agreed “that president trump or someone from his campaign worked with russia to influence the 2016 election” while 33 percent disagreed and the remainder were unsure. republicans, however, mostly expressed the opposite view: 66 percent said they disagreed that trump or his campaign worked with russia while 20 percent agreed and the rest were unsure. in the bob evans diner in jackson, three workers from walmart were sitting down for lunch. they were trump supporters. asked about the russia investigation, they stared back blankly. “i have never heard anything about it,” said chastity banks. neither had her two colleagues.

" spanish and moroccan police have arrested five moroccans and one spaniard suspected of belonging to an islamist militant cell that simulated decapitations, the spanish interior ministry said on wednesday. the arrests mark the first big raids since a double islamist attack in catalonia in august that killed 16 people, most of whom were mown down by a van in barcelona. the cell was at an advanced stage of activity, the ministry said. it did not say whether those arrested were men or women. the group held secret night meetings at which they planned large scale attacks, and carried out physical training sessions in which they simulated cutting off victims  heads, the ministry said. five of the arrested were moroccan, one with spanish residence rights. one was spanish of moroccan heritage. one was arrested in the spanish north african enclave of melilla, and the rest in morocco. spanish police have arrested 199 people in the country accused of connections to militant groups since raising the security alert to one notch below the highest level in 2015.

" the irish government was on the verge of collapse on thursday after the party whose votes prime minister leo varadkar depends on to pass legislation said it would seek to remove the deputy prime minister in a breach of their cooperation agreement. the crisis comes three weeks ahead of a european union summit in which the irish government has an effective veto on whether britain s talks on leaving the bloc progress as it determines if eu concerns about the future of the irish border have been met. in a row that escalated rapidly, the opposition fianna fail party said it would put a motion of no confidence in deputy prime minister frances fitzgerald before parliament on tuesday over her handling of a legal case involving a police whistleblower.  that would break the three year  confidence and supply  agreement that allowed varadkar s fine gael party to form a minority government 18 months ago. fianna fail initially indicated it might withdraw its threat if fitzgerald resigned but fine gael members of parliament passed a unanimous motion of support in fitzgerald at an emergency meeting on thursday evening. asked after fine gael s statement whether the country was headed for an election, a senior fianna fail source replied:  straight towards one.  the source declined to be named as the party s frontbench was due to hold an emergency meeting early on friday to decide its next move.  this is ... dangerous politically at a time when the country does not need an election,  foreign minister simon coveney of fine gael told national irish broadcaster rte, in an apparent reference to the brexit talks he had earlier described as a  historic moment  for the island of ireland. the border between ireland and northern ireland, which will be the uk s only land frontier with the bloc after its departure, is one of three issues brussels wants broadly solved before it decides next month on whether to move the talks onto a second phase about trade, as britain wants. coveney told parliament on thursday that the government was not yet ready to allow the talks to move on to the trade issues at the dec. 14 15 summit and needed more clarity from london. a breakdown of the government s cooperation deal, which has worked relatively smoothly up until now between two parties that differ little on policy but have been bitter foes for decades, would likely lead to an election in december or january. the fianna fail move comes after fitzgerald admitted she was made aware of an attempt to discredit a police whistleblower in a 2015 email, but failed to act. fine gael say she adhered to due process. since varadkar s appointment as fine gael leader in may, his party has narrowly led fianna fail in opinion polls that suggest both parties would increase their support but still struggle to form anything but another minority government.

" most u.s. presidential candidates go abroad to sharpen their foreign policy credentials. donald trump arrives in scotland on friday to reopen a golf resort. the presumptive republican nominee, 70, visits his family’s ancestral homeland to showcase his far flung business empire. his mother was born on scotland’s isle of lewis. with a throng of reporters watching, he will make a dramatic arrival by helicopter at his seaside trump turnberry resort. he has scheduled a news conference on the 9th hole at noon (7 a.m. et/1100 gmt). his visit to turnberry, to be followed by a stop at his resort in aberdeen on saturday, will allow him to comment on the outcome of britain’s vote on thursday on whether to remain in the european union. “i don’t think opening a golf resort gets you many foreign policy chops,” said saul anuzis, former chairman of the michigan republican party. “but since he’s there right in the middle of the eu vote, it may end up being a pr bonanza for him.” the risk is that the real estate tycoon, who has yet to hold public office and rates unfavorably with 70 percent of americans in an opinion poll, will make a foreign policy misstep at a time when republican leaders are urging a more serious demeanor. trump has said he would be inclined to leave the eu. he has exchanged insults with british prime minister david cameron, who has called the new yorker’s anti immigrant policy ideas divisive and wrong. there are no plans for the two to meet. his trip has baffled republican officials who say he should concentrate on strengthening his campaign and taking the fight to the presumptive democratic nominee, former u.s. secretary of state hillary clinton, who is 68. trump defeated a crowded field of opponents for the republican nomination but has faced one controversy after another, the latest over his firing of his campaign manager this week, a month before the party convention. “his campaign has got all kinds of growing pains and it doesn’t make sense that he would spend any kind of time going out of the country,” said david yepsen, director of the paul simon public policy institute at southern illinois university.  turnberry is a storied course where the open championship has been staged four times. trump invested $290 million in renovating the resort and golf course on scotland’s west coast 85 km (53 miles) southwest of glasgow. he has portrayed his determination to build up courses in turnberry and aberdeen and overcome local opposition as an example of the type of leadership skills that americans would get if he wins the white house on nov. 8. “well, scotland has already been won – and so will the united states,” trump wrote in a column for the press and journal newspaper in aberdeen. an aberdeen family opposed to his development there has threatened to raise a mexican flag as a reminder of his proposal to build a wall along the u.s. southern border to keep out immigrants who enter illegally. the last republican presidential nominee, former massachusetts governor mitt romney, in 2012 made a gaffe filled campaign trip to london, jerusalem and poland.

" u.s. lawmakers criticized environmental officials at a hearing on wednesday for not acting sooner when they saw a report that drinking water in flint, michigan was polluted with dangerously high levels of lead. “i never thought this could happen in america,” and in a state, “surrounded by fresh water of the great lakes,” brenda lawrence, a democrat of michigan, said at a house oversight panel examining the water crisis in flint, a city of 100,000. the panel issued subpoenas to officials who did not show up to testify about water found to have lead levels that hamper brain development and cause other health problems. thousands of children are believed to have ingested the polluted water in flint, a mostly african american and latino suburb near detroit. lawrence asked keith creagh, head of the michigan department of environmental quality, why his agency did not act on a report by a federal environmental protection agency expert that showed the water was polluted. she did not get a clear answer. “we all share responsibility in the flint water crisis, whether it is the city the state or the federal government, we all let the citizens of flint down,” said creagh, who took the job last month. marc edwards, a water engineer who first raised the issue of flint’s lead contamination, told the panel the epa broke laws by not notifying the public about a report of tainted water. “if it’s not criminal, i don’t know what is.” epa water official joel beauvais said he did not know why his agency did not tell the public. representative elijah cummings of maryland, the top democrat on the committee, complained that the republican led panel did not invite michigan governor rick snyder, a republican, to testify at the hearing. representative matt cartwright of pennsylvania criticized snyder and his hand picked emergency managers for flint who were responsible for switching the source of flint’s tap water from detroit’s system to the flint river, a dumping area, in april 2014. flint is grappling with the health and political fallout over the switch after the more corrosive river water leached lead from old pipes into the system. “he got caught red handed poisoning the children of flint,” cartwright, a democrat, said of snyder. “there’s no two ways about it. that’s the headline here.” a snyder spokesman responded in an email: “it’s unfortunate when people who are not working toward a solution inject partisan politics and incendiary rhetoric into an emergency that can best be addressed by people working together.” snyder will ask state lawmakers in his next budget proposal to approve a $30 million water payment relief plan for flint residents to keep their water service on and reimburse them for lead contaminated water they cannot drink, his office said. a busload of flint residents traveled to washington to attend the hearing. “we’re serious about making sure that the people responsible for this manmade disaster are held accountable,” said bernadel jefferson, a bishop. lawmakers also slammed the epa for not sending administrator gina mccarthy to flint until this week, even though the agency has known about the crisis for months. an epa spokeswoman said the agency had formed a flint task force last october, and has had a team there for weeks. the head of the oversight panel, representative jason chaffetz of utah, a republican, said he subpoenaed epa’s susan hedman to appear at a deposition in washington later this month. hedman, who announced last month that she would resign on feb. 1, had played down the memo by the epa’s miguel del toral that said tests had shown high levels of lead, telling flint and michigan administrators it was only a draft report.  the epa has agreed to provide all of hedman’s emails by the end of the week, chaffetz said.  chaffetz said his panel had also issued a second subpoena to darnell earley, who was flint’s state appointed emergency manager when the city switched from detroit’s system. a. scott bolden, earley’s lawyer, said his client has not been given enough time to respond to the initial subpoena, which was served last night. bolden said earley is “not hiding anywhere” and will honor a subpoena issued with a reasonable response time. earley only implemented the plan to change the city’s water source that others had put in place before he started, bolden said. “there was nothing put before him by the environmental folks, the water testers or anyone connected to ensuring the quality of the water to suggest in any way that a water disaster was looming.” political fallout over the crisis could also hold up a wide ranging bill on energy. democrats in the senate threatened to block a bipartisan energy bill if it fails to include immediate aid for flint.  federal authorities including the fbi have started a criminal probe into the contamination.

" china hopes the united states can  help and not cause problems  in the disputed south china sea, a senior chinese diplomat said on friday ahead of next week s visit to beijing by president donald trump. the united states has criticized china s construction of islands and build up of military facilities in the sea, and is concerned they could be used to restrict free nautical movement. u.s. navy ships have also carried out freedom of navigation patrols in the area, angering china. speaking to reporters about trump s trip, chinese vice foreign minister zheng zeguang said china has indisputable sovereignty over islands and surrounding waters in the south china sea.  the essence of the south china sea problem is some regional countries  illegal occupation of some of china s islands and reefs, zheng said, adding china was willing to resolve issues peacefully through talks with countries directly involved.   the south china sea issue isn t an issue between china and the united states,  he added.  we hope that as an external party, the united states can plant more flowers and fewer thorns, help and not cause problems . zheng said he said he hoped the united states could objectively view the positive developments in the south china sea and respect efforts by china and southeast asian countries to safeguard peace and stability there.  there is no issue with freedom of navigation in the south china sea and china opposed any parties using it as an  excuse  to harm china s sovereignty and security interests, he added.  the trump administration has vowed to conduct more robust south china sea operations. china s claims in the area, through which about $5 trillion in ship borne trade passes each year, are contested by brunei, malaysia, the philippines, taiwan and vietnam. speaking earlier in the day, another senior chinese diplomat said china and vietnam have agreed to manage their dispute in the south china sea through friendly talks, following an ugly spat over the summer between the two communist neighbors. the countries have long been at loggerheads over the issue, with vietnam having emerged as the most vocal opponent of china s claims to the majority of the regional sea.  a scheduled meeting between their foreign ministers in august was canceled on the sidelines of a regional gathering in manila amid an argument about militarization in the south china sea and island building.  hanoi and beijing, however, have sought to get relations back on track, with a top chinese leader telling his vietnamese hosts in september that their two communist parties have a  shared destiny .  speaking before chinese president xi jinping goes to vietnam next week for a state visit and to attend a summit of asia pacific leaders, chinese assistant foreign minister chen xiaodong said leaders of the two countries have had many  deep, frank  discussions on maritime issues.   they reached an important consensus,  chen told a news briefing.   both sides will uphold the principle of friendly consultations and dialogue to jointly manage and control maritime disputes, and protect the bigger picture of developing sino vietnam relations and stability in the south china sea.
